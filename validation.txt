Great rates, the bad part they did not think about is Parking, its the worst place to find parking, something they should have thought about before! I am a student and wish I could go there if I could get parking!
Not sure what was going on with the kitchen that night--i think the chef may have gone missing for an hour or the stoves weren't working?? It took over an hour for the food to come out after we had ordered-with no explanation- and the couple next to us had been waiting before we had even been seated. They got free wine refills because they had been waiting for so long!

I'm not sure if it was the fact that we were starving by the time the food came out but it was DELISH and I loved everything about it!
This review is for their cookies only.
I've yet to try their bread or other pastries - but the cookies were hard and not so delicious. Cookie Monster not like.  I've had many a better cookie, including crossing the street to Starbucks! I'll opt for a brioche next time.
I cannot begin to express how much I love this place! Up until recently, I had only picked up gifts here but now, I have some balsamic vinegars and oils to try for myself! Taste away here and have employees mix flavors for you to try, it is so delicious! Bottles range from $16-18 a piece but will last a long time! Outrageous is tucked in a small shopping quarter across from Rusty Spur Saloon and next to Del Sol. Walk around and stumble upon this gem and discover new inspirations for cooking or gifts! Will keep returning!
Wow! I've always wanted to try Pearl and I finally got my chance! My boyfriend and I went in on a Saturday night around 8PM and it wasn't super busy. Our waitress was very attentive and received excellent service throughout the night. Food came out quickly and looked delicious. We ordered pot stickers to start ($6) and were good. For the rolls, we ordered a Philly Roll, Vegas Roll, El Diablo Roll and Caterpillar Roll. All of them were delicious! I loved how fresh everything tasted and I loved that the Philly Roll came with avocado inside! My boyfriend could not stop raving about the El Diablo, which came with ceviche on top as well as 2 tacos and a shot of tequila ($1 extra). This one is for the spicy lovers though, which I am not. Most of their specialty rolls are spicy as well. 

The prices are higher than other sushi restaurants but definitely worth it for the quality! It won't be somewhere I can go often but definitely somewhere I will know to go again!
Had a great time playing mini golf with my fellow yelpers at this event! The owners and the staff are super, SUPER friendly, and really had a positive impact on the evening! The mini golf was fun, and it was different with the way they included games and challenges at different holes and through out the night. The course itself is challenging enough to keep it interesting, but easy enough to keep the game going. They also have an arcade, which I thought was a nice touch. All in all, this was a great place that I didn't even know existed until tonight  (and I live 10 mins down the road!). Definitely worth it to give it a try!
I expected dining here to be good, but I was happily surprised at how good it was.  The environment is clean and open.  They did not cram in a ton of tables so you do not feel like other people are all over you.

We showed up on time for our reservation and were sat promptly.  The hostess was very friendly.  We were immediately approached by one of our servers.  Everyone who spoke to us, including the manager were great.

We started with the Olsen Farm's Baby Arugula Salad.  The salad comes with Bartlett Pears, burrata, prosciuitto, vinegar and olive oil.  The flavors combined nicely.  It was a nice start to the meal.

Next we ordered the Pumpkin Agnolotti.  I am not a huge pumpkin fan, but the flavors together were very good.  Mascarpone comes on the side and the agnolotti comes with with parmesan and truffles.  The textures also blend well together.

For my meal I ordered the Grilled Prime Beef Filet.  The filet was prepared perfectly.  It comes with carmelized red onions, watercress, celery, fingerling potatoes, bone marrow persillade and peppercorn sauce.  While the filet is clearly the focus, the other components add even more to the meal.  The filet is seasoned lightly.

For dessert we chose the Peanut Butter Souffle.  It takes about ten minutes for them to prepare it, but it is well worth that short wait.  It is so fluffy, and filled with rich peanut butter flavor.  The lemon ice cream on the side seemed out to me, but they went quite well together.  Our server recommended we add a shot of chocolate liquor to the bottom of the plate for even more flavor.  It stepped up the flavor even more.

It was a pricey meal.  That being said, it is well worth it for the experience.
They have a great little buffet that changes every day. Sat have fajitas and they are super yummy. 

But I highly recommend asking to to sit with Debbie, she has been here forever. And even after on the away she remembers your order. 
And the chips and dips are great.
Four stars- why, because this store is not in closer proximity for 'me'! Insert laughing emoji please:)
Pleasant workers wry time I stroll in, they push those samples on you (clearly, in a good way)!  Clean, clean, clean set up for the samples.  No double dipping those fingers, samples are covered in their acrylic boxes which double as displays;) all are provided with small tongs right above- genius.  Why can't there have that, I ask myself that every time in in here. Each scrumptious & fresh pineapple shaped cookie is individually wrapped.  My favorite, yes I always help myself for those samples mentioned earlier.  No, I won't disclose how many I've consumed.  Ok, just a few. Yes, less than a handful.  Alright, multiply that and I'm an expert taster. That being said- I can assure you all varieties are worth purchasing and going home with. Double up on my favorite: dark chocolate guava.
I can't tell you how heartbreaking it is that I cannot give The Lodge more stars than three.

Especially with how absolutely exited I was to go somewhere that had Bratwurst, Berry Weiss AND Cheese Curds. The midwestern girl in me was swooning for my knight in shining armor.

The berry weiss was amazing.... really wish it was on tap, but bottle will do. The cheese curds were sincerely authentic too. I introduced several at the table to their lusty flirtatious ways, and they will never be the same again.

What ruined it you ask? The fact that it took us 40 minutes to pay our bill. When we received it, we realized we forgot to ask to split it and promptly asked the waitress. Her response?

"You should've asked me before you ordered and then I could have done it. However, we normally don't do it at all." 

What??? Um okay. We knew it wasn't all her fault and tried to split our bill. In the middle of our first attempt, she came by to ask if we were done and we said we needed a few more minutes. Well, come to third try of splitting a check 10 ways she comes back again and asks the same question. Frustrated, we tell her we are not, and she just shakes her head almost like she was angered at us and walks away.

Seriously.. who doesn't split a check these days.. even after the fact. I've seen today's digital restaurant systems. This shouldn't have been an issue. Even if she had to void it and start over it wouldn't have taken her the 40 minutes it took us.. especially because there were only two other people in the entire place.

Ugh. Meh. That was not midwestern hospitality.
Rooms were very nice! however the hotel lacks that certain "it" factor that other hotels in the area have, and the pool was very disappointing.
Beer aficionado paradise!

This ugly southwestern strip mall houses this hidden gem.  Literally you can barely see it- I've been here over 5 times yet always do a double drive by!

You walk in and you're wondering "did I walk into a lumberjack's grocery store?" Wood paneling everywhere, people with beards, and old TVs that aren't even flat screen.  The only plus is that there is a nice bar area backed up by a wall of chilled beer to purchase & take home. So how is this place 5 stars?!?

The beer!  The pizza!  Every time I come here I force my group to get a large buffalo chicken pizza.  By far the best I've had.  Little pockets of blue cheese, chicken, buffalo sauce, and celery give each bite a different yummy combo.

My favorite beer of all time is Papago orange blossom!  My friends had fun choosing beer as well.  Amazing beer list!
To a bookworm, losing either library privileges or a bookstore can be down right depressing and devastating. So imagine the horror I felt driving by Barnes & Nobles one day to see the sign gone, the store emptied and a "for sale" sign up.

I was even more annoyed when I saw "Planet Fitness coming soon!" a couple of months later. What? Seriously? There's like, a huge gym across the street, really!? Well yadda yadda, fast forward a few months after Planet Fitness opened, I got over it and joined the gym because it was insanely cheap and a great deal for me and my husband ($21 a month).

Everything sounds lovely right? Eh, wrong. Here's the short break down of the two star rating: 1. price (cheap) 2. still fairly new and not yet rundown.

I must say that the one thing that ruins an experience for me is attitude\/poor service. It's the biggest pet peeve of mine to be treated as though I'm annoying someone simply by walking through a door of a public business. Yes, I sincerely apologize for giving your job, who pays you an hourly wage, money so that they can keep paying you. 

The front desk has declined in overall professionalism and friendliness over the years. Sorry to go here but when did they start hiring hood rats? Tonight, my husband, brother in law and I walk in about 30 minutes before closing for a quick workout. My husband says hi and gives the girl working the counter my member number and says that he's also signing in as my guest. The girl snaps, "You know we close in 30 minutes, right?" Wow. And no, Miss Angry Woman, we were all unaware of the closing time that's posted on the front door that you can't miss each time you walk in. We say that we're aware of the closing time, this person snaps again with, "This is account is under [my full name]." Wow again. She had to be some sort of special to disregard what my husband had just stated when we walked in (my member ID and that he was my guest). Maybe if she wasn't actively being a witch with a B, she would have heard him the first time.

At this point, I walked away to the locker rooms because I couldn't take anymore rudeness and didn't want to reciprocate the treatment.

Look, I understand having a bad day at work or maybe being a bit peeved if a customer walks in minutes before closing, BUT YOU DON'T SHOW IT. If I'm paying for a service I expect you to be, at the very least, cordial.

When our contract ends, we may just go back across the street to their competitor. Sure, they cost a bit more but the saying is very true - you get what you pay for. We were also never treated with attitude but always greeted with a friendly hello, and the sign in process was painless, unlike Planet Fatness.

Oh and the TVs were off. They close at 9, not 8:35. Stop being lazy and keep them on until 9pm. Trying to save 5 minutes by turning them off early so you can jet out at 9pm sharp just goes to show, again, how unprofessional this place is. Ugh.
Fantastic one hour service for iPhone screen replacement. Highly recommended! Reasonably priced and expert service.
I like this place. It's worthwhile arriving early, that is true, but we went at 10am on a sunday and we were seated without any major wait.

Service was friendly, understanding, and very quick -- more on that later.

I had scrambled eggs with bagel, greens, and fruit. Eggs were perfectly "baveux", just the right texture between raw and cooked. Bagel was fine, fruit was nothing to write home about, some cantaloupe and grapes. Greens were a basic mix. But I enjoyed it overall.

One friend had the breakfast tacos, which were excellent. Decently spiced with the right proportions of ingredients.

Another friend had the pancakes -- banana oatmeal today. If you order these, beware, it IS a giant pile of stodge. 3 pancakes is heavy and could be too much if you're not into that. But the flavour was good, the batter was nice and fluffy, and they provided enough syrup to go with.

Our fourth member had the belgian waffles. He later said that he would rather have had the pancakes, but I was very impressed with his waffles. Too often belgian waffles are dry and boring, but these were exceptionally crisp on the outside, while being light, fluffy, with just the right amount of egg in the batter. I tend to avoid belgian waffles because I'm usually disappointed, so I'm no expert, but these were definitely the best I've had and I would order them without a second thought.

Coming back to the service, the reason that it's so quick is that they have obviously standardised a lot of their recipes. In the kitchen they must have giant piles of everything -- scrambled eggs, potatoes, fruit, etc. -- which they just spoon onto your plate. So if you're extremely picky, and like your eggs over-medium "just so", then you'll probably be disappointed. But as someone just out to enjoy a summer brunch on the patio, it was a welcome change not to wait 40 minutes even when it was busy. 

And plus the price is reasonable. Less than $10 a head, with some people ordering coffee\/tea. I will definitely come back.
I finally went north on the new part of the trail that starts at W Charleston and ends at Cheyenne. Sorry, I was too tired to take photos and it was blazing hot in the sun.

So I thought it was going to be a nice steady rise in elevation all of the way up to Cheyenne....wrong! In fact, it was the exact opposite. It was smooth sailing all the way to Cheyenne and then I turned around and the fun began.

One more thing about this route is that the bridge at Far Hills is much easier to ride over than the bridge at Towncenter Dr. Also, there is only one minor dip under the road at W Lake Mead Blvd.

That was a great work out!! Tomorrow I will try the entire route from Flamingo to Cheyenne.
Tried their Ferrero Rocher Cupcake (felt adventurous that time) and it just blew my mind. I thought that it was just going to taste like a good ole chocolate brownie, but when I bite the middle part, blobs of nutella burst inside my mouth. Very creative.

The cupcake itself is very soft and fluffy. Totally worth $3.75. If you're making me eat all those sugar and butter that cost me $4, it better be good and I think they delivered it. I don't think that I could buy cupcakes from starbucks anymore after I tasted it.
I got a regular cheeseburger without the salad option because they actually ran out of salad...The place was kind of pricey too because the portion sizes are a lot smaller than you think. I thought it tasted great, but for the price, I won't go out of my way. The service was not so great because the cashier was a little rude explaining to me that there was no salad left. I asked if there were any other options for greens and she not so nicely told me no.
Bel endroit pour prendre un verre! Beaucoup de choix de boissons! Ils ont des trucs à grignotter et de la musique live!
Rock shrimp tempura is awesome.  The four season roll looks amazing and tasted great.  Four kinds of fish in that roll.  Red curry is delicious.
Ate here the other day. I used to love Villa Madina, most locations were consistent and this one used to be a weekly staple.

Prices have gone up over the last two years, which is fine because I felt they were underpriced to begin with. Food quality is still fresh and good, although the meat quantity could be better. 

The reason I rated them3 stars is the change in some of their staples, mainly the tabouli salad. The recipe or how it's made has been changed. I noticed this at another Madina recently in Milton.

Please go back to the root of what you guys are good at. Fresh, quality, plentiful affordable food.
Wow!  The way the light casts into this cafe... it really makes you feel like you're on the other side of the world from the Las Vegas strip!  My date and I came here for lunch (er, our breakfast - we're night owls!), and both of us had the made-in-house yogurt with the fresh berries - just, amazing.  Delicious.  I'm salivating at 3:30 in the morning just thinking about it.  I can't remember the main course that my date ordered, but he enjoyed it immensely.  I got an omelette; I like that it was not heavily salted or greased, as I feel most restaurant omelettes are.  I added the amount of salt I wanted, and it was perfect.  The whole wheat toast that came with was delicious, as well!  To top off the positive experienced, our server was very sweet, and checked on us frequently.  Definitely a fan of this place, and definitely coming back at some point!
Been going here for all my games and such and it's a great place with good employees! Why I give it 4 starts and not five is because I had pre-ordered Metroid: Sami's Returns and the Amiibos to come with it and they SOLD my pre-order. Sorry I had work on Friday-Sunday! I came Monday, 3 days after they released and the guy says "WELP. LOOKS LIKE YOU A LIL LATE, WE SOLD IT......wanna go 20 miles from here to get it?" I calmly said no thanks but deep on the inside I was mad pissed. Wasn't gonna bash this place with 1 star for that tho, it's honestly a great place. It just irritates me that they can sell your pre-order 3 days after the release. A week would've been more fair in my opinion.
I met John at the Yelp Western Adventure event back in March.  Anyone Yelp gets to be an event photographer you know they are yeelllppping cooool!!  John handled hundreds of requests from Yelpers asking him to take their photos that night and he always answered with enthusiasm and a smile.  A photographer that can handle masses of Yelpers indulging themselves on copious amounts of free flowing alcohol tells me whaat a greeeaaaattt guy he is!
So coming down to Charlotte from Chicago was a adjustment....but finding Pasta and Provisions made it a bit easier... I am Half Italian..I was stunned that this was the only Italian Market when I first got down here...But it is one of the absolute best markets in the city. All sorts of Homemade Pasta....the Best Gnocchi, the best fettuccine..any where. Their Freezer section is full of prepared dinners and sauce. The dry ingredients are there for you as well. Great selection of Olive Oils and Dry Pasta's But let me tell you..try their sauces....Their Alfredo is a white cloud of silkiness and flavor, Their Pesto is green and delicious, Their Red sauces make my mouth water just thinking about them!   In the freezer is also Tiramisu and and Almond Cake which will make you break your New Years Resolution about eating sugar!. The Park Rd Location offers Sandwiches that are incredible..Ask for the Dominic! HE is my son who has a great palate and orders his Italian Sub with Everything and More!! Really if you are a Chicago or New York Or New Jersey transplant..you HAVE to go here!!
Really like this place! Went here once for some music, the crowd was diverse, band was good. Drinks are cheap and they have a good amount of choices. Always have specials. They have Jenga (!!) and some other games. Came here on a Sunday afternoon and sat outside, it was very chill. They had some live music, and a taco special that was really spicy and delicious. Overall, very chill divey funky place!
It seems mad to say that shops that are run entirely on customer donations often have individual styles, but it's true. The charity shop family is well-defined in my mind. There's the older lady in lemon crimplene with porcelain horses on her mantelpiece. There's her nephew in denim and his wife in a floral shift dress. There are the cool students in jackets, jeans and boots, listening to vinyls.

Then there's Shelter on Nicolson Street, their renegade 90s grunge-mix rebel cousin. She wears a man's leather jacket five sizes too large over a flamenco dress. In her lace-cuffed socks, Doc Martens, and fluorescent beads, she mooches along the street listening to Garbage.

Though charity shops in general are experiencing something of a rebirth with the vintage revolution, Shelter seems to be treading its own path. Rather than the space and carefully-arranged rails of many of its relatives, when I walked in it was cramped, chaotic, and colourful. I found a mad garment in there, which I could only assume was, once upon a time, worn by a pantomime dame, and which refused utterly to stay still in my hands but turned itself over, ruffle over ruffle, until I had no idea what I was holding. If I'd even known to begin with. 

The whole experience was a bewildering joy. One of my most fun moments in the day is staring at the wardrobe in the morning and figuring out what to do with myself today. I've found a new go-to place to spark up those moments. I didn't find what I was looking for, but I found a dressing-up box I didn't want to leave.
We've been going to Fuego for years and the food and service are always excellent. Atmosphere is also fantastic, as is the live music (when they have it). Highlights for me: sauteed prawns, cornbread, and spicy margarita.
I ate here with my husband and 2 sisters in law earlier this month. We got the table right in the corner by the street, which was great for people watching. We all really liked our food and our waitress was fantastic. The only downfall was not enough shading, causing us to maneuver the table and chairs so we were all mostly covered from the blistering sun. It was pretty expensive as well, but that is Vegas for you.
After a traumatic experience last time I had my eyebrows waxed, I decided to let them grow out. So, when I walked into E.D. Nails I had some fuzzy caterpillars on my face in dire need of cleaning and shaping. The facility was clean and simple. They had nail stations and spa pedi chairs. I signed in at the front for waxing as was greeted by Ly (pronounced Lee). She pointed at a black office chair in the corner. As Nathan D. mentioned, the setting was a bit weird. Don't expect a nice, serene waxing room. They should at least invest in one of those padded massage tables for their waxing area. Aside from the setting, Ly did a great job. She listened to my concerns and did a great job cleaning up my eyebrows. She kept a nice natural shape. The price was right and the job was done well. I'll be back!
The hunny and I dined here on Halloween!  We were on our way to meet friends and wanted to start our night with a little "us" time.

We were seated on the patio which has a nice view.  The restaurant itself is chic and modern.  The patio tables for 2 are super small!!  More like a cocktail table not really for dinner.  We started with the guacamole and margaritas which can't really go wrong!  Nice chunky avocado and not too heavy on cilantro.  We also got 3 pork tacos and some sort of steak.  Both dishes were spicy but subtle.  I think the chef used chili oil to get the slower lingering of spice.  Yum!

This is delicious but a little pricy for the small portions- though obviously I enjoyed it very much.
This isn't entirely fair, I just popped in for a samosa today over lunch. Worst samosa I've ever had, should have taken a picture. I actually didn't mind that it was baked not fried, but it was under baked, mangled, luke warm, not spicy, and the veggies inside were sad.
El Asador is situated in the middle of Koreatown. I mean, completely surrounded by Korean restaurants on every side, as far as the eye can see. Strange? Who cares, as long as they have good mexican food!

Wow is this place busy. Wednesday night, and there's a constant flow or traffic and the 8 or so picnic tables they have are constantly full! 

When you walk into this tiny corner restaurant, it transports you to the mexican dives commonly found in the states. It's the type of place you'd expect to find authentic Mexican fare, and the type of place I typically love. I really don't understand why people go to "upscale" mexican places with fancy decor to get poor quality food. Anyways... 

The crispy tacos ($3.25) are good, and the beef was definitely better than the chicken. Double layer, homemade taco shells made this a crunchy delight.  But the soft taco ($2.75) was mediocre, and the chicken was very bland. 

The pork pupusa ($2.50) wasn't very good, floury and bland, it was basically eating bread.   I'd pass on this next time. 

The nachos and guacamole were great, though the pricing is strange. $6 for nachos, when a burrito is only $4.50?

the toppings and salsa they give you in bowls were great, good amount of heat (too much for some of my friends).

the prices at this place are pretty good, you can get 3 quality tacos for under $10.  

Friendly service as well.
Very friendly and fast service.  I lucked out and got a parking space right in front of the place!  They have excellent bread.  The crunch on the crust blew me away after so many Subway sandwiches.  The Ham and Swiss could've used a little more vinegar though, and the cheese could've been more melted, but that's all that I can really complain about.

My white chocolate slush with boba was also really good.  A large was pretty huge!  I did think it could've used a little bit more flavoring.

I'll definitely be back.
This is based solely on the horrendous customer service we have received on 3 separate occasions from one waiter. We love everything else about the place and will most likely continue to eat there- we will just request to not sit in his section. 
On our last visit, the pompous waiter with the blonde pony tail first approached our table by saying "what do you want to drink" in a way that made us feel like we were inconveniencing him. He was several feet from our table and facing sideways. I asked for a Dr. Pepper and he rudely replied we don't have that and then I had to ask what they do have. He simply replied Pepsi and then I again had to ask what that included. He sighed and looked at me like I was a moron for not knowing. 
My boyfriend has worked in the food industry for several years and it takes a LOT to upset him at a restaurant. But he immediately went to the hostess and asked to be placed in a different section. 
The hostess was very professional and immediately sat us elsewhere with no questions asked. It made me think this has happened before. After a few minutes the rude waiter approached our table and with attitude asked if he did something wrong. I told him it was his tone, body language, facial expressions and over all attitude. I told him he has been this way several times with us. He tried to argue and I told him I didn't need to have this conversation. He smugly said sorry and walked away. 
I have also seen him yell at the women who work there several times. I can't believe this man still has a job. If you can't be nice to people then why would you try to work in customer service. This prick is cherry blossoms biggest and only downfall if you ask me.
My friend recommended this place to me so I tried it out yesterday with a friend for a pedicure, and I loved it!  As soon as you walk in you can see that the place it well kept and clean - BIG plus!  It's very classy but still comfortable, and from what I experienced, the people working there are really nice.  The prices are reasonable and I left totally satisfied.  The pedicure was great and I genuinely enjoyed myself.. what more can you ask for?  I highly recommend this place, and I'll definitely be going back for more services!
De l'extérieur on dirait un endroit délabré, où les hobos y ont trouvé refuge. Et tu rentre...tu sens une odeur de pachuli, de café et de vieux vêtements (tu sais l'odeur qu'on retrouve chez Renaissance et au Village des valeurs...) Et tu découvre cette friperie grandiose où on y trouve beaucoup beaucoup de choses!! Des vêtements, des tableaux, de l'art, des costumes d'halloween, des livres, des accessoires, des biblios, des lampes, de la bouffe...OUI OUI ils ont un comptoir à café avec des plats du jour! 

À chaque fois que j'y vais je découvre des nouveaux endroit de la friperie. En premier, je connaissais seulement le premier étage, ensuite j'ai connu le deuxième étage. Cette fois-ci j'ai découvert le sous-sol et leur méga terrasse. Bref, pour ceux qui aiment découvrir et aiment les friperies c'est l'endroit parfait. Les lattés sont 2$...pas cher pas cher. L'an dernier on pouvait louer des costumes, cette année, ils sont à vendre. Beaucoup de choix pour pas cher. Je vous conseille d'y aller avant d'aller dans ses magasins d'Halloween...Vous ne serez pas déçu.

Je mets un 3* pour la propreté des lieux...ceux qui sont allergiques aux acariens, amener vos pilules contre les allergies. Cela ne me donne pas très envie de goûter à leur plat du jour.
This place is AWESOME I love the enviroment the great customer service and these bad ass innovative ideas for tasty healthy grubbin, this place is indeed GREAT GRUBBING
They no longer have happy hour. Boo...........
First off, thanks to the other Reviewers on here for helping me find Mopedman in the first place. Reviews don't lie! After searching through every possible Scooter Dealer shop within a 45 minute drive radius, I narrowed it down to 2 shops that sounded worth calling. I called one other Dealer, then Mopedman. My search stopped there! Mark answers his phone. That was the first good sign. And from there everything on his part was nothing less than absolute first class service, from start to finish! Mark was professional, polite & reliable as heck. His prices are great! (I've done all my research & this was also my 3rd Scooter purchase). And he is not only knowledgeable on all his products from the inside out, but he goes the extra mile to get you educated on what you're buying & gives extensive instruction on how to maintain it. Why is that so important? Just read the reviews about all the problems people have when shops DON'T DO THIS. He is extremely thorough. Needless to say, I bought a gorgeous Scooter there yesterday & road it home a few hours later! He has inventory ready to go in different model classes & choice colors. The one I happened to pick didn't come with a rear case (for extra storage). I asked for one & he through it in at no additional cost. My Scooter runs great & I have no doubt Mark will be there (as my go-to) in the future when I need help & for regular services. I don't write many reviews. Only when I feel I've found a business worth sharing (the wealth). And Mopedman is genuinely all that & more!
Great place to watch a game, grab some grub, hang with friends and play trivia. The wings are solid and the garlic fries are great. Make sure to ask them about their daily drink specials. This is considered the Charlotte Buffalo Bills bar for any Bills fans out there.
After six months of growing my hair out,  it got to the point where the ends had become so shaggy that if I drank too much wine, there was a high risk that I would take scissors to it myself. And we ALL know how that turns out. Fortunately, I was near Element 5 salon and I was able to score a walk-in appointment within the hour.

My appointment was with Allison. She was friendly and listened as I told her the goals I was trying to accomplish by growing out my hair. She asked me what kind of look I was going for, if I wanted layers in the back or if I wanted it more straight, and we mutually agreed to take off  1.5 inches, or about half of the growth from the last 6 months, to even out the last remaining layers in the back.

After a shampoo and conditioning in the sink, Ashley got to work on trimming my hair. Cutting hair, especially when you're trying to get it to grow out rather than cutting it in any specific style, isn't too challenging but the real risk is getting a stylist who chops off way more than you want, or who doesn't communicate or listen. Allison did a great job, and certainly didn't leave me surprised by the amount she cut, which I really appreciated. 

Allison pointed out that the only remaining layers were some face-framing layers, from some long ago grown out bangs. We agreed to just layer and soften the ends of the very front, leaving me with a softer framed look up front and no layers left in the back.

I love the results of my much-needed trim, and the entire staff at Element 5 was welcoming and friendly. Allison recommended that I come in every 3 or 4 months if I'm trying to grow out my hair and just get a half inch taken off to keep things even. Now that I know this salon is there, I will be sure to get in more frequently as my hair grows out.

All in all, a great experience. I'd recommend the salon to anyone in the area.
Usually I do not go out to Chinese restaurants as I only order take out once in a blue moon when I am home and have nothing in the refrigerator, but Fin came highly recommended and we really didn't want to go too far (we were completely burnt out from working the AAPEX trade show all week). 

Like most people we did everything family style so we can try a bunch of dishes. We had the Mongolian Beef, General Tsaos Chicken, and Seafood Lettuce Wraps. Each dish was light, fresh, and delicious. I was very happy with our choice and would defiantly come back here again.
This new location is great! The space is much much larger and they are able to produce more beer to meet the growing demand! This spot is easy to access and there is plenty of parking. Come check it out!
Wow - I love to organize!  It just makes me feel good inside.  This store is an organizer's dream!  

The staff is friendly and helpful, the store is always clean, and they usually have some sort of sale going on.  I picked up a few things for my pantry, and had a painless return when some items didn't work out.  

This is definitely my go to store when I'm feeling the need to clean up my life!
Chocolate lovers unite. Stylish chocolate Cafe similar to Juliette st Chocolat in Montreal. Their hot chocolate menu is pretty extensive and each one comes piping hot in a cool goblet. Depending on which chocolate on the chocolate spectrum you order it could be very sweet or bitter, but all will be thick and not some watered down hot chocolate. 

Their food items are pretty lame except for the chocolate fondue. It was fun to try once but it's pretty expensive. 

Long lineups at night, we came at 9pm and waited for around 20mins for a table of four.
Great park in the heart of uptown. Its also located right across the street from the brand new BB&T stadium where the Charlotte Knights baseball team plays. It also has a real nice water display that lights up at night to add the how great it looks. 

In addition, its great to have lunch here if you work uptown. There's live music here during the lunch hour and sometimes after work hours. All in all, its a great park to visit, have a picnic, listen to live music, watch fireworks....and the list goes on.

I would never come back and I would never recommend this salon to anyone!! My sister and I went in for mani's and Pedi's on my birthday and somehow it took almost 3 hours for us to get both done! The day we went they were not busy, there were only 4 technicians working so we ended up having to wait about 30 minutes with our feet in cold water before our pedicures began. Both of our technicians were nice but not good at what they do. My gel manicure started peeling off in a few days and my pedicure looked terrible that I ended up going to another salon a week later to get another one because I couldn't stand looking at the terrible pedicure any longer! I wish I would have went to another salon but now I know to avoid this place like the plague...
Korean street food. Theres that guy that reviewed "Cheap. Quick. Delicious." and he's not wrong. 

Always go for their rice and fish cake. The taiyaki is fresh. Perfect Yonge and Finch chill food.
The food was great.  From the appetizers to the deserts it was very good.  The service was solid and the scenery is very good.  The atmosphere is very dry because of all the business people eating there.
I have to agree with Helen Y. I love the atmosphere at the Farm at South Mountain. However, the Morning Glory Cafe left much to be desired. 

I didn't mind the wait, as that's typical during weekend brunch. I especially loved that we were lucky enough to get a table on the outside of the layout so that I could keep my bike near me while we ate. Unfortunately, there is no good way to lock your bike up while on the property from what I could see. And this isn't just because I'm overprotective about my bike (though we all know I am).

The service was fairly good. Our sever kindly answered all our questions and dealt with our crazy bill splitting. Our meals came out in a reasonable amount of time and all at the same time too :)

On recommendation of the server, my debate between the spinach mushroom omelet and the eggs Benedict ended with the Benedict. I probably would've rather had the omelet or some a la carte items. For some reason the eggs Benedict just seemed overly spiced to me, and I love spice. The home fries didn't look or taste right either, though I've seen pictures of them looking delicious :-\/

As far as beverages go, the revolution individual herbal teas are the awesome. I didn't even know revolution made those. LOVE. Also loved the way my friend's mimosa came, with a small carafe of orange juice and a tiny bottle of sparkling wine. Individual sized things are also the awesome.

One other small note... crayons for the tables would be awesome if you always use the white paper as a tablecloth!!

Will I come back again? Probably. There were a lot of items on the menu that looked delicious. I had a piece of the apple-wood bacon and it was heaven.
Yes, there are tons of older folks there but so what! It's the best omelet I've had in quite a while!  I had the asparagus, pancetta and swiss omelet and hubby had the avocado and bacon omelet.  His was better but both were delicious.  Hash browns nice and browned and the pancakes were much better than Ihops but not to die for.  Will definitely be back!  Oh, and our server was excellent!
Worst "Hawaiian" I've ever had.  I've eaten at the Chandler Gilbert Road location and don't remember it being this awful.

The rice was properly cooked, but the bbq chicken was stringy and chewy, while the nori wrapping the musubi was the worst nori ever.  It was so gummy and tough!  Seaweed is not supposed to be chewy like that!

I won't even get started on their lack of saimin and use of the term "noodle soup".  (I tried the seafood one once years ago and it was pretty horrible and didn't resemble saimin, ramen, or really any Asian noodle soup.)

They've also taken Loco Moco off the menu.  Disappointing, even if theirs did use onion.

Avoid.  Stick to L&L in Happy Valley, or find a small mom and pop shop like Aloha Kitchen in the east valley.
Publix is a great grocery store. The quality is high but the prices can be too. I look for their BOGO deals. Each item scans at 50% off, so you don't have to buy two! I always stop by their deli to get weekly specials on Boar's Head deli meats and cheese. Also, if you haven't had a sandwich from them make sure you check out the weekly deal! You can even order online. All the employees are super friendly and always helpful.
One of pittsburgh's finest restaurants.Fantastic, flavorful Italian cuisine with great and I mean great service. My girlfriend and I went their for valentines day. Menu was great, she had the jumbo shrimp scampi. Jumbo is right extremely large shrimp with fresh crabmeat and a decadent butter sauce. I had a breaded pork tenderloin topped with crispy prosciutto, eggplant, cheese mushrooms and probably a bunch of other stuff. Anyway it was a great take on a classic dish and portion was well worth the price.
Tambellini is one of pittsburgh's finest chefs and to add to it he's always around his restaurant greeting his guests, it's a great feeling. Great for any occasion, we will absolutely be back!
Interesting menu. Great service. Tried the shrimp rolls with pineapple sauce and hula burger - both really good. My husband loved the ahi tuna sandwich. My favorite was the key lime pie for dessert. Can't wait to come back and try some of their other unique food and drink items!
Along with my husband and 3 other friends, we went to the Orange Sky for drinks.  I had dressed up very nicely for the occasion including my Ellen Tracy top, black pants and nice jewelry.  I also wore patent leather thong sandals.  Upon entering the ground floor by the elevators to the Orange Sky, I was told by the maitre d that I could not go up because I was wearing flip flops.  Meanwhile, others in tennis shoes and baggy jeans were allowed.  My friend said she had some old walking shoes in the car and we should get those.  So, I went out to the car and got the dirty old walking shoes and proceeded to put them on and head back.  No problem - admitted.  Now we get to the top and I see other women in silver thong sandals, beige thong sandals, etc.  

We had drinks and a couple of apps (salmon cakes and the chili beef tips).  They didn't have much of a selection of apps and really no imported beer.  The apps we did get were expensive and nothing very special.

The sunset, however, was spectacular in spite of the dirty windows but to be fair, there had been a dust storm the day before.  

On the way down, I stopped by the maitre d again and told him I saw other women in thong sandals and he said that was not true and that he would not let anyone in with "flip flops".  I'm not sure if this guy had something against me or what but he certainly seemed to have missed the entire concept of the purpose of a dress code. 

I would not go back here in spite of the lovely sunset.
Parked right in front of the restaurant (located at the former Boston Market corner area facing Central Ave) at 4:00 and had no wait to order at the counter.  The kitchen and cashier section are more cramped than the Fashion Square location.  All unoccupied tables were clean, including the plentiful picnic tables outside.  Water from the condiment table was chilled, and there were plenty of cups.  My small single-item order was completed within a few minutes.

Single 'Mallow Monsoon: Far superior to s frosty, and also better than a Dairy Queen blizzard.  The chocolate and vanilla custard are swirled but not completely blended, but the overall flavor leans strongly chocolate.  I could not really taste the marshmallow sauce.  The chocolate truffle cookie dough were super rich and reminded me of fudge brownie pieces.  The sugar cone cookie pieces had a fantastic crush, and provided a great contrasting texture.

Shake Shack may be cost a little more than its competitors, but their quality is a step above as well.  My concrete was $4.98 after tax.
Great option for when no one can decide what to do. Love all of the options, and that you pay by weight.
How do can I describe La Paz? Well lets see, lousy service, below average food that is over priced in a trendy neighborhood that is the best description of this place.
An hour and a half for delivery and I live less than a quarter a mile away. Just no. When we called they said is was taking long because it was raining. OUR ORDER NEVER EVEN CAME! No call no nothing. Good thing we were willing to drive to Wok Wey. This place is ridiculous.
The tofu or chicken fried rice is a solid lunch and very tasty.  Unlike their neighbor Blue Fin, they don't have their chicken cooking forever on a grill and drying out.  Their tofu has an excellent firmness and is almost chicken-like in texture.

I'm happy they got rid of the minimum charge for credit cards.  I used to barely make it when I ordered a soda too, but I've since given that up.  

They have parking out back and are excellent at getting you in and out on your lunch break.  Waitresses are very efficient!

You get used to the converted diner decor after a while, honestly!  They do really need to repair the banquettes (booth seats) properly though!
Only three stars for The Lounge, mostly because of how you smell when you leave Excalibur: reeking of cigarette smoke.  It's not unique to the lounge itself, but a general casino thing.  I've played shows in this lounge, and the sound guy is friendly and can handle us a-okay.  There is one waitress who gets our drinks for us, and I asked for straight up pineapple juice (not a drinker, myself); and next time I was there, she asked if I wanted that again.  Love that she remembers!  (I didn't say no...)  Usually there are pretty good crowds that gather, though not always wildly excited to be there.  Not too shabby, I suppose...
Donc, cela fait 3 fois que j'y vais depuis que c'est ouvert. Des supers cocktails pas cher les soirs de semaines entre 4@7, incluant la bière! 

L'ambiance est quand même bonne. 

La nourriture est passable, mais rien d'extra selon moi.

Par contre, les serveurs sont super sympa et c'est un bel endroit au centropolis. J'ai beaucoup aimé la déco.

N'oubliez pas de réserver, car les line up pour une table sont inévitables 

Je mets 3*, car ils n'ont pas de permis d'alcool pour leur granfe terasse. Ce qui enlève beaucoup de point à ce nouvel endroit. Esperons que l'été prochain ça ne sera pas le cas!
I had an amazing experience here. I came in around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon for an oil change. I received fast, friendly service. Gilbert, one of the managers on duty took the time to go over what the best options were for my vehicle. Not only did they change my oil, they washed my windows and vacuumed my car!!! How awesome is that? I was in and out in 30 minutes. Fast, friendly service at an affordable price. Can't beat that.
I don't like to leave negative comments but Nick (the reviewer) is absolutely right. The staff didn't even look at us, told us to come back after "a few minutes". He didn't tell us when to come back. As a matter of fact, he didn't tell us to come back at all. I get that people need to take a break, that's not what I am complaining about. It's the way he said it. If you like to be treated like a customer, not a nagger, go elsewhere.
If there was a zero I'd use it.  We purchased a Groupon that didn't expire until August 8, 2016, mind you its still available for purchase for 2 more days as well. When we walked in, the first question was "do you have the Groupon" we said, "yes" and she informed us that we can not use it for another 2 or 3 months. We pulled up the Groupon to look for restrictions and there are NONE. She then told us "new management"...I assume that translates to, "we have your money and are going out of business but thanks"!  Horrible people. Too bad, too as we were looking forward to trying something new.
The food is great!!! Too bad that's the only good thing about it. Customer service is BAD and with an ATTITUDE. They take too long to bring you the food but it comes with the check.
Nice people work here. The place is always clean and the gas is Shell.
Since last review have been back many times and still love the place.  As I stated on prior review, I don't come to Phoenix without stopping here at least once. I would love to see one in San Francisco. The food is very unique and creative.  Fish dishes are excellent.  As others have mentioned it can get crowded and service at times is off (hence the 4 stars).  I typically go at off hours (late) and have had no problems.
This was my fifth  time at Basil Thai...I have been to the Uptown location three times  and the Stonecrest location, twice. I used to go to JoJo's Chinese which was housed in the same location. We had a party of 7 - and we ordered some appetizers to start...which was the Chicken and Beef Sate and the Egg rolls.  They were okay...just okay...Not anything to write home about...The condiment tray was nice...some great green Thai chili's in vinegar! We ordered Hot sake..but Alas..it was not hot..and it took forever to come to our table. ..It was weak and unremarkable. My entree was the Basil Barramundi, which was a great fish that was not the least bit fishy..tasted very fresh and filleted beautifully. The problem is they put the same scoop of Thai Vegetables on every Chef Specialty that comes out of the kitchen and it just wets down the entree. It did not need to have that ladled on . It was on my husbands Red Curry Duck and also my daughters Basil Thai Duck and my Barramundi . The atmosphere is nice...lots of tables but I truly think the food at the one Uptown is better and the Kitchen Manager needs to rethink a few things.....Thai - Out...
Finally, a good sushi joint in the northwest!

They have everything from standard sushi to some good creative rolls, nice atmosphere, good service.  I'm especially happy there's a number of tempura rolls on the menu.

And the Final Fantasy rolls have to be tried.  Great presentation, and very tasty!
If you want to eat here for weekday lunch, get here early. This tiny restaurant fills up quickly, so by 11:45AM there was already a wait list on my last visit.

This restaurant is tucked behind a fountain in a corporate building and I never would have found it if a friend hasn't taken me there on my first visit.

The menu is filled with delicious sushi items and combos. The only problem with that is I don't like sushi. (I've tried, I really have! I've never felt such peer pressure to like a type of food.) Fortunately, they have some non-sushi alternatives on the menu, but not very many.

My usual dish is the Sesame Chicken, and it's good, but not great. The sauce tastes like it's artificially thickened pretty heavily (more than a little cornstarch in it, I think) and it's spooned over the chicken, rather than the chicken being tossed in it. I tried ordering the shrimp version of the dish once, and it was a mess. The coating was falling off the shrimp and it was more trouble to eat than it was worth.

Service is solid, if unremarkable (that's a good thing, in my book) and the price is reasonable. My friends love it so I keep visiting, but I probably wouldn't go if it wasn't someone else's idea.
I met a group of friends there, and proceeded to hang out and dance for a few hours.  The music got to deafening level a few times, which wasn't great, but otherwise we loved this place.  The drinks were good, the glow sticks made the night even more fun, and the bookshelves and small vases with red roses made it feel classy and sophisticated.  Really enjoyed my night here.
Amazing Atmosphere, Beautiful decor, Island music, sure takes you to a happy place.  The food on the other hand needs some work. Portions are small and prices are on the higher side. I was extremely sad to have my Mango Margarita served in a small plastic cup (kind of cheesy if you ask me) but the drink itself was out of this world. Don't stop in hungry because the wait times are longer than normal. I think with a little coaching and training this place will be a great addition to the flats. I'd definitely give it another try.
We decided to try Mama Lena's in Waxhaw because we wanted to try a small, local restaurant in town. It's a quaint little place and we were sat near the kitchen soon after our arrival.

There are plenty of pastas and typical Italian fare on the menu. Their fresh baked bread is delicious and you can order beer\/wine by the bottle or glass. Service was attentive, once the wait staff figured out who was going to serve our table.

I ordered the manicotti, and I can't recall what my husband ordered. The food was good, but not overwhelmingly great. We enjoyed our meal, and it was reasonably priced.

I don't know if we'll be back to Mama Lena's. It's not worth a trip out of the way, but if you're in Waxhaw proper and are craving pizza or typical Italian fare, it's worth a visit.
Another lunch spot near the office, it does the trick when I have a shawarma craving but I've had much better. 

Positives are that I see them charring the chicken early in the morning on my way in so I know they're not serving leftover meat from the day before. It is real meat and deliciously marinated. I also enjoy their garlic and hot sauces. The price point is more than fair as well at around $6 for a nice sized sandwich. 

Negatives are that the place doesn't seem the cleanest, I've heard some stories of rodents and I know they've had conditional passes before but so long as I see the green pass when I go in, it doesn't bother me too much. Also they don't press the sandwich enough at the end, they have a line everyday so I imagine they're trying to pump out as many meals as possible. As a result the sandwich is often cold by the time I eat it.

3* A-okay, does the trick.
I have two dogs.  One dog is 9 years old and has been to the vet for his usual shots and a couple of minor things over the last 9 years.  My other  dog is 3 years old and since we got him from the pound 2 years ago he has been to the vet on average once every 4 months.  You can liken my dogs to a Toyota that only needs the oil changed and a Ford that breaks down constantly.  Del Lago has been there for all of my routine vet needs and the various other minor emergencies my youngest dog has endured.  The problem child had to have surgery to remove a lump and the doctors at Del Lago let us bring him in as often as we wanted to have the wound cleaned and wrapped, with no charge.  It is those little things that make it obvious they really care about our pets.

They can handle all of your regular vet needs with care and compassion.  They also understand if you bring in your dog and say, well, he may just have a stomach ache or he may have swallowed my flash drive.  They treat each case with seriousness and give our dogs the best care we have found.
Borderline terrible. I had their veggie breakfast frittata and a cappuccino.  The cappuccino was returned twice, then I gave up realizing that this place didn't have a clue what they were doing.  The frittata was edible, but looked like snorting you would get from a hospital cafeteria.  The home fried potatoes were gross.  Worse than anything you would buy from the frozen isle at a truck stop.  

Completely not worth ever going back.
The food here was really good, especially for the amount that they give you. We all left with leftovers and that's saying a lot because I almost never leave places with leftovers lol. The restaurant itself was nice and has plenty of space inside. The staff was helpful but took too long with our drink orders. Overall, a great laid back hibachi spot to get some good food
This was a nice surprise.  I had no idea what to expect so I came in with a blank slate.  The chips were good.  The salsa lacked flavor and bite.  Our server brought out a much hotter salsa upon request.  It had a much better bite and flavor.

As per usual I ordered cheese enchiladas.  They were tasty with a nice sauce on the top.  Everyone else in the party was also quite happy with their new meals.

Planet Hollywood is a fun casino to hang out in.  It is good to have an affordable food option.
This was THE WORST take out \/ delivery I've ordered, of any cuisine, ever.  Large amount of food, some inedible.

Most things were completely bland, some had more oil than any other single ingredient. The korma was OK, and rice was OK. to be fair.
I've been informed by a fellow Yelper that they are just closed for the season, I hope they're right! I find it strange they don't keep their phone number in service with a recording and that they didn't cover the course up to protect it from weather, vandalism, etc. Either way, I can't wait to get my game on in the spring!
Me and my husband got married at this hotel last month. I stayed in a standard room with my family for the first two nights, and the room was just alright. Nothing fancy or impressive about it. For our wedding night, we booked a suite and requested early check-in. When I attempted to check in that morning, the lady told me that a suite wasn't available yet and to try again later. Totally understandable since I knew that early check-in wasn't guaranteed. The thing that got me though was when I asked her to please call me when a suite became available. She replied, "This is a big hotel. We don't do that." WOW. I'm sorry that I'm not worth a simple phonecall, especially when I am getting married in your hotel and paying nearly $20,000 for the chapel and catering services!  Minus three stars for the rude customer service at the front desk!
Apparently, when it's rainy and cold (hovering around 50F) Phoenicians do not venture out to the trails because I had the WHOLE park to myself- not another soul in sight except for the ranger who greeted me then promptly went into his office. 

At first I hesitated to venture onto the trail as an urbanite, I was a bit awed by the silence of being in the vast preserve as the only person out in the open. 

Then I told myself I had driven all this way in the rain, whole time not knowing if I would hike to just walk for ten minutes and turn around so my driving in getting there was not wasted. 

I bundled up in my down jacket, gloves, and hat- put on my headphones w my Tibetan meditation music and just started walking on the well groomed, wide trail with no expectations. 

And you know what?

It was divine, it was heavenly, it was purity to just walk with no need to make conversation or to hurry to keep pace with a group. And it was cold and lightly raining but after awhile, I warmed up and forgot about the light rain. 

The surrounding was serene and peaceful that I felt so grateful for the preserve. I said my thank you to the people who created the preserve. It was simply a perfect existence. 

I followed the trail and decided to hike to Brown's Summit and really the whole trail is easy. In fact this is a perfect beginner trail for someone who want to try trail running. Even the ascent to the summit is not bad. 

There was a moment of mysticism when I was sitting at the summit taking in the view. It started to rain harder and then the whole summit got covered in clouds. I could see the clouds coming and forming. It was so thick for a bit that I could not see the hand in front of me. In all my years of living in Phoenix, this was the first time for me to experience something like this- so much like Yellow mountain in China. 

It was so calming, so centering to be there at that moment. 

Then I started my hike back to my car- it was so cold, my iphone froze and that was fine too. I hiked in silence. Again, no expectations. 

What a fantastic preserve. There are quite a few affluent homes in the area, I hope they take the time to hike & enjoy this treasure.
OK, I'm originally from Detroit and this place is pretty close to the real thing.  In many ways it may be better because the amount of hamburger they use in the chilli.  My only knock are the hours, it's only open during the week for lunch.  I live downtown and I would love to see the hours extended, especially now that there are so many people moving downtown with all the apartments being built.  I think this place could even be open late on the weekends with all the night life downtown too!  Would be great food after a night of drinking!lol.
A strong five-star from me.  

Pros: 
Menu
Flavors
Execution
Service

Cons:
Ambiance 
Can be crowded

Surely a gem!  I enjoyed a chicken breast combo with a chocolate turtle doughnut & grapefruit mimosa doughnut with a cold brew. 

My friend & I chatted for over an hour and the staff cleared our plates and even took a photo of us together.  Great doughnut flavors!!!
Truly epic. Service was outlandish. Food was even better. George, the manager, was there to make us feel like VIP's.  Literally - best sushi I have  ever had and I'm picky. Bar none, the best oysters I've ever had, tuna, yellowfin belly, you name it... they asked us what we wanted, and they brought out what we had never dreamed of.
Overall, Deejai Noodle Bar in NoDa is putting out some interesting dishes in a cool space, but nothing about it knocked my socks off.

Pros: Interesting noodle dishes. I had the salmon curry. Tasty but I wouldn't get it again. The salmon was cooked perfectly but the thin rice noodles and thick curry sauce didn't work for me. The kimchi poke bowl was tasty. I'd get that again. 

Cons: The parking lot is weird to get in and out of. Save yourself the headache and park around the building. Service was fine but nothing to write home about. 

Glad to see the ethnic cuisine scene in Charlotte expanding. I'll definitely give them another shot.
Good tacos, quick service and cheap prices . I ordered two of the lengua tacos that was good but not great they made them fresh to order and the location is pretty convenient probably wouldn't go again but it's worth a try.
A friend and I visited here after a long day out in Death Valley.  We were tired and starving! I had the black bean burger (fantastic!), with tofu fries, and the acai blueberry smoothie.  Everything I had was delicious, and I devoured it.  My friend had the sweet potato fries - good, but I was glad I got the tofu fries (I'm a lifelong vegetarian, so I love tofu!).  The food is good and the people who work there are super nice.  Will be coming back here again.  = )
This year was my first time going and had an excellent time! I loved how many breweries there were represented from across Arizona and other states. I don't remember every beer I tried but I do remember leaving quite "happy".  Props to the event planners for thinking of everything, including the cooler fans that felt amazing on a warm day! I will definitely come back next year!
Went here expecting a good steak and we were disappointed. Salad was good and service was ok.
The short review... Tons of TVs and crappy bar food. I'll echo other Yelpers and endorse the BBQ chicken nachos. Skip the burger... overpriced and underwhelming. Keep your expectations realistic and you'll be happy with Icehouse.
Strongly recommend. This is truly a local business that loves it's local community. Ownership is sincere, genuine and passionate. They make so many delicious baked goods! Yum.
I was first introduced to Avalon by my artist friend Gary who helped designed the restaurant.  On my first visit with him, we had drinks and appetizers.  I remembered the drinks were great and what stuck in my mind was the ahi tuna on top of thinly sliced caramelized green apples.  The thinly sliced caramelized green apples added just enough sweetness and tartness to the ahi tuna to make this dish truly delicious and memorable.
During this visit, I was introduced to the chef and owner Ryan and was impressed by their vision and passion for their restaurant.
The second time I visited the restaurant was with my mom's club where everyone was really excited to try all the dishes on the menu.  So we each got a different entree and passed the plates around.  Everything we had was top rate and delicious.  What stuck in my mind from that visit was the lobster bisque.  Rich and creamy and full of flavor!
I've heard they've added live music to certain nights- with the beautiful, contemporary interior, it's definitely a great place for date night so I can't wait to go back with my husband to enjoy the ambiance, music and of course the plate licking good food!
Ce bar à salade avait un beau design à l'intérieur.  Le prix est moyen.Le service à la clientèle  était chaleureux . Un incontournable !
Cute little restaurant. Came for brunch on a Saturday as my family and I were exploring DC ranch and ran into this spot on Market street. The place wants busy so we had our choice of a seat and decided to sit on the patio. There was live music across the street at another restaurant that you could hear which was nice. 

Portions were a nice size and everything seemed fresh and prepared with care. We ordered the grilled fish tacos and they were small but delightful. There were 3 so we fought over the third one and ended up splitting it. My husband's omelet was flavorful and my daughter's eggs off the children's menu came with tater tots. I ordered the BLT, which came with perfectly crispy bacon and the sriracha mayo added a unique twist. My dish came with a side of fresh greens with a light Dijon flavored vinaigrette. 

Service was great and the owner or manager made sure to stop by our table and chit chat with us. Enjoyable experience.
Awesome breakfast spot. My new fav! Everything including service was wonderful. Definitely recommend their pancakes. The berry pancake came w so much fresh fruit!! The cinnamon pancake was like a Cinnabon  Loved the spinach, bacon and Monterey Jack scramble!! Cheese grits were so creamy. It's nice you can substitute your side for a pancake. Will be coming back again real soon!
Great food and great service. You can see the kitchen from the dining room and the entire restaurant appeared to be very clean.

Appetizers:
Grilled Spring Rolls (Chicken, Shrimp, Beef)
The spring rolls were excellent. They were served with fish sauce and peanut sauce.

Entrees:
Oxtail Soup - The best oxtail soup I have had in quite some time.

Vermicelli with Lemongrass beef - it was okay. Kinda bland for my taste.

I will definitely be back to try more menu items. I would recommend that you give this place a try.
Best Fish n Chips in town! Staff is friendly, made us feel comfortable. Atmosphere was very inviting and the food was amazing. Could very well become one of my favorite places for 2017. We stopped in on a night that it was raining but I am hoping next time to take advantage of the beautiful patio area.
Fresh faces and lots of smiles today! Jason was friendly and took my order at the front counter. my coffee was done within a minute! Music seems slightly louder than usual today. But it could just be me. Traffic has been kind of busy since I've been here and place is still pretty clean! Good job, guys!!
Great Hefeweizen. Love the Garlic fries too. Nice large place. Great for haning out with friends after work or a movie.
Just by having queso fundido with chorizo on the menu T&T was off to a great start. It was pretty solid queso too.

Then to my surprise I found another of my Mexican favorites, street corn.  It was great.  It had a lot of flavor.

This is a good place to get some decent Mexican in Las Vegas.
Let me first start off saying I had the hardest time finding someone who spoke English ! A guy who worked there followed me and sisters around the whole store. I asked him why was he following us ? He didn't understand me. I asked him if he needed help with something , still no response. My whole experience was just bad.The cash register woman let a Hispanic man cut me , because that was her friend. I Feel Like they treat African American like trash.
I feel like the best parts of this restaurant were the appetizers and the Robata.  we tried the Tuna Tartar which was extremely fresh and tasty, the plantain chips were a great addition.  For Robata tried the salmon with miso and the flank steak with teriyaki sauce.  Although this was just a skewer of protein it satisfied me as I felt if I ordered an entree of either dish I would of been slightly disappointed.  For an entree I tried their Lobster Roll, which was tempura lobster, cucumber, avocado.  Entree comes with a lobster tail of fried lobster which was a nice addition.  I felt the menu had too many tempura options for maki, I wanted more of a selection on fresh non-fried rolls. My gf had a salmon maki roll and it was really tasty and had a great amount of fish but it was to simple for me, I am a fan of specialty rolls but felt they were all way to similar.
Je   trouve que l'activité  est très divertissante et même si on ne sait pas jouer ou qu'on  joue mal au golf . Y aller c'est l'adopter .
We returned to The Capital Grille, this time with some friends. I could not help myself and ordered the dry aged steak au poivre with a courvosier cream sauce again. It did not disappoint. The steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The cream sauce adds a nice flavor. Of course we had to have a side of the au gratin potatoes. I had talked them up, and after dinner everyone admitted we should have ordered at least one more order of them. 

The service was very good. The entire staff is friendly and knowledgeable.
Love this place! If I ever have international guests I will always take them here. It's so much fun and the food is amazing! I love the natto, chicken udon, and any sashimi. Make sure to get a round of sake bombs, they're always fun.
AMAZING! I called them out and they said they would be out within the hour. Much faster then I expected. They got a little snagged up with some car problems but it wasn't a huge deal. They came and dealt with the bees in an expedient way. The guy answered all my questions about the pesticides and the bees! I will use them again but I cross my fingers I will never have to! This is a great company!
This is one of the few Middle Eastern markets in Las Vegas. They have a nice selection of grocery items here. It is a good place to pick up the spices you will need to make Lebanese food.

They also cook Middle Eastern food here. I tried it a couple of times and it was good. They make kafta, shish kabob, chicken....etc.
Love this church! From the first time I came I felt accepted and now active in it. All types of people are accepted that I've seen haven't felt judged. Pastors challenge everyone to grow in their walk with God. Everyone should experience VBF.
Despite the other reviews this dog park is quite quaint! Besides having to park across the street in a dirt lot (it's really not that bad). The park is big
And spacious with nice landscaping and if you have a hyper pup like me then this park definitely gets the job done!
Until recently I was the duchess of d'lish and it's about time I updated my review to reflect how amazing of a place it truly is.. a diamond in the rough. 

Once I first tried the food menu I was insanely hooked. I now have a goal of trying every single thing on it and I'm about half way complete. It's a great place to swing by for breakfast to not only jump start your day with some protein, but to jump start your day with fun. One time a robot took my order!!

Lunch is just as nice. The staff is great while you are there and really appreciate their customers (and they even tell you).

My favorite breakfast has to be the croissant sandwich (with no tomato) and for lunch I've ended up getting the chicken panini more than anything else. 

If I'm craving a hot drink it's always a chai latte and for cold it's an arnold palmer with black tea.

If you haven't been here yet, you should go out of your way to swing by!
It was an okay experience. Liked that the balls has gps embedded. The venue itself was like a cleaner sleeker driving range with monitors. We got situated all the way across from the pool. Only saw a few people using it.  The costs can add up quick as this feels like they are nickel and diming. We stayed for an hour in the 3rd floor. $60 + $5 membership fee per player. Got 3 drinks. Total was roughly $100.  The bay allows for up to 6 players, so you can minimize cost that way, but that just means less golf time per player.
bad  bad  bad  !  mauvais  mauvais  !  sans  respect   envers les gens  !!!!  bad  bad bad!   taste  very  very  bad  !  liar  liar liar  liar  liar :  they don't respect  custumer
My daughter likes to go to this saloon to get her hair cut. I guess she is happy with the stylist. My complaint is about their false advertising. They sell deals on Groupon and then they do not want to honor them. They said only certain stylists honor the Groupon. They should disclose that information before they make the sale. They make it impossible to use the groupon.

I rarely say this, but I do not recommend that anyone comes to this salon. Shady!!
Best tacos in the city! I am no expert, but I always feel satisfied after eating here. I have tried the Baja Fish (Fried Haddock), Gobernador (Smoked Marlin Shrimp and cheese), Carnitas (braised pork shoulder), and Cabeza (Beef Cheek and Head Meat)...I would reorder  all of them! There is usually a line up, but totally worth the wait! I do suggest going early before items are sold out.
This really is a great beer venue.  Somehow even the fact that they don't serve food themselves turns into a strength.  The food trucks that they keep on a rotating schedule means that the menu is always new and fun.  The patio, once gravel, is now paved and new tables have been added.  

The beer is probably the best I've had in Pittsburgh going wayyyyy back to the first micro brew renaissance (please read this in old fogie voice) way back in '97-'00 or thereabouts.

I'll qualify the review by saying this place is VERY close to me in an area that has previously been pretty devoid of fun, hip places to hang.  So maybe my five stars is a bit...exuberant.  But honestly...it's good beer.  Super casual.  Good energy.  Dogs welcome.*

*Actual dog animals I mean.  That wasn't a derogatory reference to unattractive people (who, I believe are also welcome).
This is a case of knocking it before I try it, but my review is still based on facts. YumTum\/ Toronto Underground Market is a food fair. You have to pay a cover and then you have access to various "vendors\/chefs" selling food for reasonable prices. So where is the problem? The problem is that it's not a reasonable cost. 

Online the cost is now $22.60\/person PLUS a $2.50 service charge (WTF??!?). So basically you're looking at about $50 for two people...since you're probably not going alone.

Once in, each serving (depending on what it is, costs around $4-$5 on average). You're probably going to want to eat more than two things, since you're there, but lets say you're being cheap and you eat $10 worth of food. Now, for two people, you have spent $70....on a sampling of food, which may be good, but better be dipped in gold for that cost!

Other accounts tell me that this place is sort of turning into another Taste of the Danforth...which used to be awesome...and now it SO crowded, it's totally not enjoyable. So be prepared to wait in lines. 

This event sounds like it has turned into a total racket. Someone is racking in the dough. I would LOVE to support local food vendors and chefs, but it won't be like this. If it was $20 and you got tickets towards vendors of your choice (got to choose 4 samples, for example), or was cheaper, it would make more sense to me. This doesn't feel like it's supporting chefs anymore though. Feels like a money-grab.

Let's see what else...parking is hard to come by...according to Yum Tum's website and so they provide a shuttle bus that runs EVERY THIRTY MINUTES! 

For $70+ I can go and get a nice, sit down dinner with my husband...parking outside the door and that's what I'll be doing this Saturday. Have fun paying $70 for a few nibbles everyone!
So I get the appeal--a gourmet popsicle on a hot summer day.  Unique flavors\/fusions.  Something fun and different.  I totally get it.  A lot of people will pay $3 for something like that and be really happy.

I got the pineapple basil.  Two very good flavors on their own.  We picked them up from the Downtown Farmer's Market on a hot summer day.  I was pretty underwhelmed with my popsicle.  The cost for two popsicles is $6.  I could make several at home at that price.  It felt as though the pineapple was not pureed enough.  I enjoyed the flecks of basil, but overall the citrus of the pineapple was not strong prominent enough.  It was like a frozen chunky stick.

The honeydew pistachio was also very underwhelming.  Honeydew is such a light flavor that it probably should have been left on it's own.  The pistachio (which should be chunky! from the chopped nuts) overpowered the melon.  Just not good.  I probably won't even return.  Sorry.
I stopped in here after I had tried for a few weeks to find the time. I got there 30 minutes before they closed but they were happy to serve me. I had sent my son to try it last week and he had already been back for more. The food is so great, tons of flavors, and fresh. The menu is just printed on several sheets of paper, which can only mean that it changes regularly which is a great thing. Get over to this place and try it....soon!!
Okay Lux, I can move you up a star. I'm still not a fan that most of the time it's hard to find a seat and have it be quiet enough to focus on anything. Additionally, I am sad that my favorite shoe chair that was an important part of an evening I had with Tony A. seems to no longer be there.

However, when I came back this past Saturday for a velvet with your homemade whipped cream, you truly delivered. It was the perfect temperature and a million times better than the last one I remembered. Bravo. Now move closer to my house and we'll be all set.
Shitty guitar techs, bought a guitar and the dude fucked up the truss rod before i left didnt even get to play the new guitar, by the time i got home there was buzzing on the high e string and b string on 5th fret. Seems like he fucked it up just so i can bring it back n have it worked on
OMG - came here with some friends for Brunch and wow!

We did have to wait for about 30 mins for a table for 4 (but it was later in the day). 

Looking at their menu,  we wanted to try everything! the French toast, the strawberry shortcakes..donuts (they were sold out by the time we got there).

but we wind up only ordering two things: 

the classic - 2 eggs any style, house cured bacon or sage and onion sausage, crispy griddled red skin potatoes with sea salt and thyme. Served with toast of your choice. Upgrade your toast to a buttermilk biscuit 

Emma's Benny - Warm and fluffy buttermilk biscuit topped with house cured peameal bacon, poached eggs and smothered in mousselline sauce. Served with a side of griddled red skin potatoes.

big portions - really good!

if you want the benny, make sure you asked them if they still have it as they tend to sell out quick - I had ordered the last one of the day!!!
Total hole in the wall. I'm always the only white boy in the place. But you know it's good as many Mexicanos with their whole families arrive here regularly. Huge menu. The Hispanic guys at my place of work will vouch for the excellent consome loco, a fresh homemade chicken and rice soup served with avocado - hits the spot during cooler seasons. Normally they hate all mexican places in town but they like this one, so that's all you need to know.
This place is a solid coffee shop at the East End. They sell artisan coffee, Japanese-size sandwiches, & Japanese-inspired desserts. The desserts are less sweeter than your average North American desserts, which is perfect for an afternoon snack.

The place has that sleek & modern clean cut look. They're very accommodating for work. Whenever I stayed for longer than 1 hour, one of the barista would offer a glass of water. 5-Star service seems impossible to copy & paste in Toronto.

Honestly, this place is my secret go-to Matcha place. You could tell that these guys sell none of those pale diluted Matcha, but the real deal-extremely green stuff from Japan. I always get Plain Unsweetened Iced Matcha. No milk of course, because the real deal doesn't require milk to enjoy.
Solid 3.5 rating for this place.  It's hard to rate it anything else, since all I had was a glass of wine (though it was good).  I got carded by the staff, which is a compliment, but nothing extraordinary about O'Aces that would make me come back over and over again, especially since (after poring over the menu) discovering there were no vegetarian options that appealed to me.
Brunch here is so good! The French toast is amazing- try the monte crisco! Traditional monte crisco with eggs covered in melted cheese served on French toast. Easily enough for two meals, as all their food is. I hate breakfast potatoes so they offered me a side of tomatoes instead which, for me, was perfect. I would have liked a fruit salad option but I thought the tomatoes were a unique and satisfying accompaniment. We don't come often because my husband doesn't like their dinner but I've never disliked a meal here. The chicken and garlic noodles is my favorite lunch\/dinner dish. Service is always standard. The cheesecake is pricey but worth the occasional splurge!
The food there was mediocre it wasn't that good but what was really gross was there were two large ants in my food I definitely will not be back
The truffle fries are excellent.  The bone in  filet was very good.  The salads and desserts are also yummy.  The service was good and the environment was nice.
Stopped in here recently as I had to purchase a couple of items for my care.

The staff were all pleasant and friendly. I'll definitely go here again when I need something auto related.
I'm definitely a fan. The service was awesome, prices were right and the food was filling. We went for brunch and walked into a mostly empty restaurant. The sweet potato pancake had a unique texture, a bit on the sweet side (no syrup necessary), but delish. The biscuits were buttery and flaky. Awesome. The Shrimp Creole omelette was tasty and really filling. It was filled with shrimp and topped with a spicy tomato based sauce. Skip the OJ - it's the gross concentrate kind. A great down-home Southern restaurant tucked away in Uptown.
If you've never been here, just go.  Don't be scared off by the strangish casino location.  The restaurant has a cozy diner feel.  Very clean dining area and friendly staff.  Get the short rib grilled cheese.  Half fills me up but it is sooo good it's hard to stop eating.  I love their fries.  They are like matchsick crispy yum. If you are a fat fry person these aren't them. 

I have been here for lunch and late night.  All times good.  Check it out.
I love this little coffee shop! I have heard that it is actually owned by the same person as V3, but I cannot confirm that! The prices are amazing for what you get. However, prices have varied depending on the worker (rarely but it has occurred), but regardless, you can't really beat it. The workers are always welcoming and willing to answer any and every question! I think they still do it, but I know they had a punch card for buy 10 get one free coffee, so that's a plus! They have so many flavor options as far as syrups and you can mix and match! If you sign up for their mailing list, you will also get notifications about free single origin coffee tasting days! In addition, they have sandwiches and pastries (which do go in sale before close, wink wink!) I definitely recommend!
I love Postino's! Great food and wine. The only downside is that it is on the smaller side and cannot always accomodate large groups.
Its a cool little spot, good food and caters to the younger crowd. Not that they won't give you the same service if you were older but the decor and ambiance is more for the younger hipster folks.
Dealing with a situation where a family member has spent time at AGH - needing to have a meal, we saw Legends and decided to try - Oh my!!!!!!
Not only was the staff amazing - the food was delicious- we have gone each day (except today - closed Sunday's ) 
In the midst of such a trying storm, we were so blessed to find the wonderful place - thank you all so much !!!!!!
This place is amazing! We went here to celebrate a friend's birthday and I've been meaning to come back again. We were seated outside and was attended to right away. 

I am not a big fan of steak but I have learned to love it after having steak here. So trust me when I say, it's really good.

Also, order the bone marrow appetizer. You won't regret it!
A true French Patisserie in Charlotte. I've been on an almond croissant kick lately and my hunt for the best one in CLT brought me to Renaissance. 

Nicely baked, flaky, and plenty buttery. The almond filling was fragrant and nicely balanced throughout the entire croissant. They had brewed coffee that complimented the croissant well. I would definitely recommend Renaissance's almond croissant.
Well...we just sold the house for asking price. Buyers loved the backyard!
Thanks again Rob...you're the man.

We are getting our house ready to sell and had a limited budget. Rob designed a cost effective and beautiful landscape project. All of the plants and trees are growing nicely and the backyard is transformed. Rob's design will help the house sell faster for a higher price. Would absolutely recommend Coconut Contracting. Thanks Rob!
Went here for the Duke vs UNLV college basketball game. Awesome arena! It was very crowded and getting into the arena was a breeze. The front door and security got us in very quickly. The seats were amazing. From the looks of the building and seating arrangement, there's not really a bad seat in the house. 


I hope to be in town when other events I'm  interested in are going on. I enjoyed it here and can't wait to be back. The best thing of all... Duke won!
I was in the area and decided to give this place a shot. You can dine in the small shop or drive up to the takeout window, which is literally a sliding window on the far end of the tiny dining area near the counter and kitchen.   

To me, the food was just ok. I tried the frybread taco which came with either green or red chili served on top. They offered me a sample of each and I opted for the green, less spicy chili. Not many toppings were served on the taco, mostly lettuce some cheese and a few tomato sprinkles. Came served with a few different salsas in squeeze bottles, the kind you usually see ketchup and mustard served out of in other restaurants. 

I will say the service was really great. Very friendly staff. When I told them I had my own water they even offered me a cup with ice so that it was nice and cold. Super sweet and seemed like it may be family owned with the mom cooking in the back and father\/daughter working the front area. Who knows if that's the case but they also seemed to know their customers personally and took time to make sure everyone felt welcome.
Les dimanches et les lundis à 20h il y a de l'improvisation en anglais. Les spectateurs doivent voter pour le meilleur comédien selon eux. C'est une atmosphère amusante. Il n'y a beaucoup de choix de bières.
I came here for a gathering with a party of 10.  We got to sit on the second floor with the comfy sofas and coffee tables which made it easy for socializing for a large group.  The atmosphere is nice and I'm sure it's even nicer during the summer when it's not all dark outside because you would get a great view of the lake behind the restaurant.  

I tried their Smoke House Burger and was surprised how massive it was when it arrived. It's a classic cheese burger (double patties), smoked cheddar, bacon, garnished with crispy onion strings and a garlic mayo sauce.  It was definitely a heavy burger, but well worth the calories.  The side of fries was average, nothing special. There's also a large selection of beers to choose from and for those who are interested in trying different beers there's a sampler where you get 4 different beers to get a taste of 4 of their in house brews. The service here was average, nothing bad, and nothing outstanding.  I would come again if I was in that area.
I want to love this place. I really do. The things I do love about it are its energy and its atmosphere. Wait staff does a nice job, and I think the cocktails are above average. The bartenders seem to take pride in their pours. 

But the food isn't what it should be for a place like this. It's good, don't get me wrong, but it's definitely not much better than good.

And somethings aren't good, for example I had some oysters on the half shell that I wouldn't recommend. 

The brussels sprouts are good, but it seems like everyone has good brussels sprouts these days.   Pork belly mac & cheese was OK but not great.  The luxury pie was a bright spot. And one genuinely great dessert is their sticky toffee pudding.

I will keep returning here, because I love the energy and the atmosphere and because the food is good enough. But it could be better.
Yummers! So many great breakfast choices, good portions, and decent prices. I like how you can customize their breakfast items to get exactly what you're craving. Be sure to try their protein pancakes! I've always enjoyed excellent service too.
Great little find. The food was good. We had the B&G wings and the Jalapenos. B&G wings were my favorite. Wine was tasty and the prices were very reasonable for happy hour.  We will be back.
If you want the "I don't give a shit " attitude from some of the service dept staff take you car for service here . Horrible experience from the service dept staff not all but all it takes is one. First a last time I take my car there. Avoid if you can
After moving into a new apartment we needed a few things. Stopped in here to pick them up and were very happy with our experience. 

Nice looking store inside and out.

Friendly staff. Will definitely visit here again.
A nice alternative to Starbucks.  Their Ice Blended drinks are really good, and you can get them with reduced sugar and fat free milk if you wish.

They've also recently added a cookie mix in that adds a "cookies and cream" flavor to your cold blended drink.

Their food selection has always been lacking, but to be fair, I've had some horrible baked goods from Starbucks recently too.  So maybe their focus on a smaller selection isn't too bad.

It does irk me that their Keurig-like line is called CBTL instead of Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf...
I can't help but follow in Georgie S's footsteps. I've been here a few times with friends that are crazy pasta fiends, and I've enjoyed the food, and I always enjoy their company. However, I can't help but agree that Harley's is way overpriced. 

I want to give you more stars, but I have a hard time finding tomato-less items and the bill always makes me feel like I can't enjoy the rest of my week.

I do have to say though that the atmosphere is top notch relaxing. I always feel at ease here and only one time has there been a noise issue, which makes me wonder why the out of towner's didn't have their birthday party elsewhere...

I can't say I'll give it up for good, but I definitely have to think twice every time I agree to dine here.
I tried Asian One right after they opened and found their Kung Pao chicken to be rather disgusting. Reading the review of the hibachi steak, I figured I'd give it one more go for lunch.

I ordered hibachi chicken for carryout, and waited and watched while they prepared it and seemed to prepare a bunch of other items too, which must have been for other carryout orders since the other 5 people dining in were eating.

Asian One has a completely open kitchen, which I sure hope doesn't bite them someday. I had a few concerns while watching them. Most notably someone grabbed a raw chicken breast from a bucket to put in the skillet, and then without washing their hands grabbed some raw vegetables and the tongs to cook with the chicken. No clue if this is a major hazard or not, but it's probably something I'd do at home and I figured everything going into that skillet was cooked within an inch of its life. Still, I'd think they might treat raw chicken like the nuclear biohazardous waste Food TV seems to think it is, in a totally open kitchen. (In all fairness, I'm sure none of us wants to see what happens in the CLOSED kitchens.)

Brought the food home, and meh - it was okay. It was Tintin-like (the Uptown restaurant, for those who don't know it) in quality and taste, even including the weird creamy sauce I have gotten before at Tintin. I hate that mushrooms are pre-chopped to very small pieces in the vegetable mix so it's impossible to remove them. It was a $10 lunch, which is on the high side for what you get.

Asian One is okay, but it's just not to my liking. My husband wants to try it so I'm sure we'll be back at some point, but really only for him.
I've been here twice, I think the service is iffy.  I do like the food, but I'd rather go to Dave and Busters
My son really loves Iron Chef--he enjoys dumplings and noodle dishes especially--and we've received great service when we've gone.
I came here for lunch today. I called and made reservations for 12:30pm. This place is usually busy at lunch. It's always a good idea to call ahead just in case especially if you're a big party. 

The service here is impeccable! The hostess showed grace under pressure.  She was taking reservations on the phone and at the same time, respectfully asking for my information. She seated us right away and our server came by to ask for our drink orders. The staffs know their menu well enough to make recommendations. I like restaurants that ensure that their people are well-trained and knowledgeable. 

I have been here for business meetings a couple of times. I always order their pizzas. My favorite one by far is the Mushroom Pizza. I changed it up a bit and went for the Prosciutto Pizza today. It is delicious! I think you can never go wrong with any of their pizzas. For appetizers, I recommend the truffle blue cheese chips. They are addicting! 

I would love to come back here and try their dinner menu. I think their excellent customer service and their wonderful drink selections are good reasons to come back.
If I could give this grocery store 0 stars, I would.  But, the parking is decent for an urban grocer so I guess I can settle for 1.  I've been yelping off-and-on since like 2009 and I will never understand how some folks can be so generous with ratings...

Aldi as a company deserves 4 stars, sure, but this location?  Please call the Health Department.

I went on a Sunday morning.  The store was a mess.  The product displays were out of sorts and there was trash in the buggies.  The creamers had broken in their container and grabbing one made my hands sticky.  The worst part was the egg display.  Outside of the cooler was an egg cart with half broken eggs that had seeped out of the containers.  The inside one was the same way.  It was, hands down, the most disgusting thing I have ever seen.  I tried to bring it to the attention of the store manager but the guy doing the check out was not willing to help me.  A call to Aldi corporate--I didn't get a call back.
My Valentine's Day date took me here for dinner.  First of all, we were late for our reservation because my date had a corporate gig run late, and they were extremely accommodating and friendly about it!  When we arrived, I got my fresh, beautiful, red rose (all ladies who come here receive one), and were seated immediately.  We had a few different servers attend to us - one for wines, one for our salad, and another for the rest of our needs.  I was blown away by the romantic setting, incredible service, and the impressive food!  As a vegetarian, your options are limited here, but never fear!  I had the vegetarian entree, which changes by the day.  When we went, it was mushroom ravioli, and oh wow.  It was SO good!  They were out of the raspberry cheesecake when we got to dessert, so we chose the berry tarte instead... I'm glad they were out of the cheesecake, because we wouldn't have gotten to try it otherwise!  (There are no words for how good it was.)  Everything about this experience was extremely positive.  It is on the tad pricey side, but if you want to really give a woman a romantic evening, this is the perfect place to go (unless you're vegan or a raw foodie, that is...).  Thank you Hugo's Cellar, for a lovely evening!
This ought to be a five-star review.

Had it not been for a few minor aggravations, it would have been.

Let's get those out of the way first: the card machine was broken - not their fault I know, but running up the road in the rain to the nearest cashpoint does sully one's experience a little. There was no sugar on the table to put in my tea, meaning it had to be pilfered from another table. FInally, the girl serving didn't ask me if I wanted ketchup on my bacon roll, leaving me to assume it would be delivered on the side anyway, which it wasn't...

But those are minor aggravations. Mini mini mini qualms. Overall, PJ is quite simply L.O.V.E.L.Y. Big and fresh and high-ceilinged, with a good line in yummy-looking cakes (including some simply adorable mini macarons) and a fine Chesterfield sofa, this is my kinda place for real. I don't get out to this end of town all that much but this is definitely a beacon to draw me back. (Although it looks like they're opening a branch on South Bridge, so, y'know. It depends where the sofa ends up. I'm fickle.)

My bacon sandwich came on proper wholemeal bread, just like you'd hope, in a roll bigger than my palm. Ok, ok, tiny mandolin hands render that comparison useless. Let's say about the size of a saucer. A happy size. A truly filling size. Sure, without the ketchup it was a little drier than ideal but not so much that I bothered to actually ASK for ketchup. Add to that that my pot of tea was good and generous and cost me less than two quid, and I was properly set for a darn tootin' good day.

Thanks, Pat Jacob. Looking forward to having you in Old Town!
Sunday brunch- major yes!  All you can eat until 3pm featuring a salad bar, 2 types of rice, and several yummy authentic homemade Indian\/Pakistani dishes.  As I recall, it was $26 for 2 of us including a fountain drink.

I'm pretty new to Indian cuisine and this buffet let me sample nearly everything... Except the goat, which they had 2 preparations.  The chicken was the bomb!! All the sauces are flavorful, savory, fresh and homemade.  Of course plenty of naan to soak everything or eat it like a pita.  The mixed vegetables were a highlight for me- potatoes mixed with other veggies in a tomato based sauce.

The salad bar was super cold with nice greens, red onions, something that looks like hummus but taste like cinnamon pudding??  The garlic sauce that looks like ranch is awesome!

The ambiance is cafeteria\/grocery store but honestly the food is worth it.  We saw a mix of people dining here- families and couples alike.  The food stations and tables were spotless with tables being bussed promptly.
I don't care for the lunch buffet because of its limited options (mostly potatoes and beans for vegetarians, sometimes some previously frozen veggie medleys) and lack of spice (for understandable reasons), but for dinner, especially take out, I give Peoples 4 stars. 

I usually get either Baingan Bartha or Aloo Gobi, as well as a dal and a plain naan. The dals are confusing because there are three on the menu and they only really have two. I've tried to stop letting that perplex me, but I can never remember the one they don't have and often try to order it. Maybe my take out menu is outdated in that I should cross that one out. Ok, now on to important stuff...I order a spice level of 10 out of 10. The results are dynamite! Instead of using some cheap sauce or hot oil, I can see and taste that they use fresh chillies for added spice. They also use a ton of cilantro and delicious almost caramelized onions in the flavoring of the dishes. Each bite is a mouth explosion. And I love mouth explosions! 

This restaurant has it's shortcomings, but since it's the only place in town that has satisfied the lust of my taste buds for hot oral pleasure, I am a big fan.
This is the best sushi I have ever had.
Unfortunately, not the best customer service. It wasn't horrible, but after dinner my bf and I agreed that if the service had been a bit better we would have been over the moon happy with Takara. 

That being said....we will still go back time and time again because the sushi was seriously that amazing.
Super cute family owned place with lots of character and nostalgia. Best chips and salsa I've had since I've been in Phoenix. I just got a couple tacos and they were very good! Customer service was great too. I will definitely be going back sometime to take advantage of the $1.75 margaritas all day every day!!
Roti's are delicious I too love the butter chicken and am looking forward to trying a vegetarian roti next time.

They are very one-note but I suppose that's to be expected. I only mention it because it is a very large portion and by the end I find myself feeling very full and a bit tired of having one taste sensation. I'll accept your rage towards that comment if you must.

Definitely spicy as others have mentioned, I go medium and it's what others may consider hot hot. 

Very tasty, certainly over priced, but sometimes when the time comes I gotta have some Gandhi.
This is a solid option for a quick lunch or late night snack.  I ordered two potato tacos and an order of Chronic Fries.  You get to choose your toppings for whatever you order which is nice.  There are a decent number of options.

The tacos were good.  The flavor was good and the portion size was ok.  The fries are a huge portion.  They are best shared by several people or multiple meals for one person.  The fries are good, and they do not skimp with the toppings.

The staff was decent and I got my food fairly quickly.
Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  We had our wedding weekend at Camelback Inn, so of course we enjoyed Rita's Kitchen several times.  Their brunch options are AMAZING!  I love the made to order waffles, pancakes (they'll add M&M's!), omelets, and french toast.  There's lots of fresh fruit and unlimited orange juice and coffee.  Prices are reasonable too!  The service is super attentive, the scenery gorgeous.

They do have a pricey Sunday brunch, but we passed on that one....

I can't wait to return with my husband to reminisce and enjoy some yummy food!
I just had the Hainan Chicken Rice two days in a row and I still want more! That's how good it was. The chicken is super tender and the skin is my favorite part! It comes with deboned half dark half white meat. I really wish I can pick between dark meat or white meat - I personally liked the dark meat so much more! The three sauces that come with the dish are super good - hot sauce, ginger sauce, and sesame soy sauce. But if you like a sweeter taste, you should request the sweet soy sauce. I like to put all four sauces on the chicken and the rice, super yummy combo! 

The prices are a little steep - the Chicken Rice is $8.99 then $1.99 extra for Chinese sausage. But they do use high quality ingredients! 

Beware that this place is not that fast if you are in a hurry or want to pick up to-go quickly. It took ~20-25 minutes to order and get our food. Right now it seems like it's just the two owners that work here, and Jenny (one of the owners) is taking orders, delivering food, cleaning up tables, and packing up to go food. Given how popular this place is getting, they probably need to hire some help soon!

I will be back very soon!
If you want gourmet steak and eggs served by a waitress in pajamas, this is the place. Any way you want them, with an air of whimsy. The portions are large, the paninis are delicious, the philly steak and eggs was divine, the coffee strong, and the refills plentiful.
Great food great service. I like that there was a large selection of meats to chose from. It was well season and I liked that the grill was set up so everyone can easily reach it. 

I liked that the waitress was very precise in what we asked for. 

Green tea ice-cream was so good.
Meh!

Soft drinks cost $4.50 everywhere in the food court WTF!!!!

$10 for a Sammy... Got the Hawaiian it was ok not great. 

Mediocre and overpriced. Kind of put me in a bad mood. Combo for chips and a drink is $15... Seriously. Ok charge $20 but it better be amazing... It's not!

Oh well
WOW really......carbs on carbs on fat on carbs....

if you want super junk pizza and a huge slice within 5 minutes of ordering than this is your place. They have tons of options for you like a pizza with avocados, beef, sour cream....a burrito pizza if you will.

Their Mac & cheese pizza is supposed to be super popular but really Madison, really?
Excellent plus friendly service and food was great. Good portions and never had to wait long for anything. Definitely will go back!
This is absolutely the best barber shop in town. I have been coming here since they opened and the service is always hands down, top notch! The atmosphere is relaxing and traditional which gives you that authentic barber shop feel. Chat's experienced barbers are consistently professional, courteous and can accommodate any request with ease. From fades to shaves, I've yet to have had a bad experience here. Denise, Siv, Chat or any of the Friendly Barber family, take your pick; you can't go wrong! Plus, while you wait there's always hot tea, coffee and snacks, not to mention that she offers great, affordable prices. Thanks guys! You are amazing!!! I would gladly recommend Chat' Friendly Barber Shop to anyone and everyone.
I ended up here on a whim and I'm glad that I did. The decor of 300 East is beautiful and rustic. The staff was helpful and friendly and was very patient as I glanced over the menu.  I ordered the veggie burger with the season pumpkin Mac and cheese and my taste buds were delighted. I also ordered a side of the root vegetable soup with the goat cheese and it was phenomenal!!! This will be on my list for go to places in the future!
Absolutely great!  Super customer service by everyone in here and Nita is amazing!  Moved from the SW side of town where I had someone good but too far to drive. Tried another place at Craig and Jones where they were rude and cut my face.   Nita was great. She is nice and does a great job!  Finally a place I can keep coming back to.  

And to add it is super clean and a nice place!
Quick, fast, convenient, decent.  Not a destination though.

The corned beef sandwich was very good, though the sandwich bread was very thin and floppy (despite being toasted), your typical off-the-shelf grocery store bread.  The French fries were nice and hot, with a good crispiness to them.

I ate on the patio next to the fountain, which was nice.
I found this place from a friend who wanted to try out a new shop, after seeing the results from his tattoo I was impressed. I wanted to try this shop out, I went to get my chest tattoo'd and went to numerous places at first and the pricing was ridiculous. I went here and I was hooked. I love this place, the environment is awesome, & the people that work there are ULTRA AWESOME ! Josh Adams is my tattoo artist, & he's legit. He does any artwork I throw at him and he does an amazing job. Buddy is rad too, he did one of my co-workers tattoo and it turned out perfect. If your a tourist, this is the place to go if you want local pricing and a safe sterile space, if your a local then you know what's best for you, and coming down to one of the best shop in vegas is your only resort -downtown tattoo. BAM !
Nearly in the shadow of the "big" breakfast places of Scottsdale, tucked away in a commercial plaza steps from Shea Blvd., this humble mom & pop nonprofit cafe provides outstanding coffee & excellent food to customers at low prices, while devoting their profits to feeding children.  The Alpha Omega breakfast sandwich was all it should be & more - a very generous size for $5 (same price for every breakfast entree ): sausage patty, dried egg & cheese on a good roll), including hash browns.  Friendliest proprietors around, who welcome their customers & briefly explain their mission.  The result is a desire to pay a little more to help the cause, which I happily did.
Had a couple of hours to kill and wasn't sure what or where to eat before watching a movie so we checked out what was on tap in the casino. Our choice was Vino Italian dining.

So this has 2 parts, a dine in sit down experience and a what to seem from outside a pizza take away.

No real reservation was required. We walked in and we're sat down to a casino style or standard Italian decor setting. The dress code was casual, so ladies leave your cocktail dresses at home, and fellas that bow tie you wanted to wear won't do you any justice here.

The menu was your typical run of the mill american Italian dishes that neither disappoints nor gets your belly rumbling.

We had unlimited garlic bread which seemed to be pretty fresh. And the glasses of wine were a heavy pour. (Smiley face)

Ordered the pork stuffed shells. Now this wasn't a bad dish, it had some great flavor and interesting sauce that may have been made in house. 

A couple of Knocks on this place was the food was so hot when it came out, the sauces were still boiling on our dishes. We had to wait 15 minutes or so to even try it. So that was a little bummer.

I can't give this place 5 stars, it isn't the worlds best Italian restaurant but if you have 3 star expectations, this place ain't a bad selection if your looking in the casino with half decent prices.
Great beer and food in the northwest valley. Comfortable vibe, and they actually play decent music. The haboob IPA is fantastic. Foodwise, all the sandwiches I've tried have been good, as well as the "dirty" fries. They also have a fried pb&j for desert.
J'ai été rejoindre des amis là-bas après que ma soirée ait déjà commencer il y a quelques heures....Je ne m'attendais à rien...

Et je rentre...les gens sont dans une ambiance de feux!! Des mega longue table à la style "Octoberfest" pour accueillir une grosse gang qui veut célébrer. Les filles sont aussi habillé avec un costume d'Octoberfest et on peut commander des MÉGA GIGA PICHET DE BIÈRE...pour une personne :o De ce que je me souviens ils avaient une belle sélection de bière et pas trop dispendieux. J'étais au bar, je parlais aux inconnus les inconnus me parlaient, et tournée de shooter pour tout le monde!! Bref, une clientèle super sociale. 

Côté musique, tu sais le genre de chanson que tout le monde connais et aime chanter fort quand tu as bu un peu trop, c'était ça :) Et très diversifié. Il y a un groupe de girl qui a commencé à danser une danse en ligne et je me suis jointe à eux...Bref, pas super ma danse, mais j'ai eu beaucoup de fun avec ses girls. 

Je vais certainement y retourner en sobriété, voir si l'ambiance est toujours comme ça ou c'est le fait que j'étais pompette...à suivre...
Stopped in here for breakfast because I had a meeting in the hotel and there were no other options.

The staff were friendly and polite. The food was good. But as is typical in a high end Vegas hotel be prepared to be overcharged for everything.

Two of us had breakfast. I had pancakes and she had a omelet. We each had a drink. It came to $50.
Been coming here off and on for over 30 years and it's still great a little mexican food restaurant. The sign out front still isn't lit at night so it's easy to drive by if you don't know where it's at. They've expanded to seat more people as the original only had a few tables. Only downfall is they charge for an extra bowl of chips. Might as well just order a nachos. Quick attentive service and decently priced.
No, but you don't understand, it isn't LIKE that, guys. It isn't snooty. It isn't scene. In fact, if you didn't know that everything here was good and virtuous, that whatever your dietary requirements you are probably guaranteed to find it catered for, you wouldn't realise that that was the whole point. Sure, there's gluten free stuff, vegan stuff, dairy free stuff, juice cleanses, organic boosters, aaaaaaall that jazz.

But it doesn't feel preachy or superior - it's just... really nice. Wooden tables, big front window in a leafy street in Marchmont just beside the Meadows, lots of light and space, and a mighty fine looking lemon tart I want to go back and try. Yep, it's a winner. Maybe they could do with a couple more comfy places to sit, perhaps, as one of my lasting memories is of "quite hard".

However, my carrot, orange and celery juice was a super-refreshing start to a day that would later contain, from another establishment, two coffees in a row and the world's largest slice of red velvet cake, and yet I felt healthy all day because of the juice. Maybe that's the only danger here: the ability to fool yourself your diet is JUST FINE because you feel so good from just the smallest Meadowlarking of a morning.
Holy hot chocolate they weren't kidding when they say to come early for parking. I had read Jennifer H.'s review but I guess I really didn't get what she meant when she said the cars were backed up to the 101. I exited at 7am from 101 and it took me 45 mins to the race grounds and park. By then, the 5K was already over!
After taking almost 2 hours to get to the race, I was not going to leave without running so I ended up running the 15K instead!
The parking is definitely an issue I have never been in a race where it took so long to park. I'm not sure what can be done to improve in this area for next year. 
Otherwise, the race was very well organized from packet pickup to day of the race. There were a ton of port o johns and volunteers handing out Gatorade and water at the aid stations. I loved hoodie, hot chocolate, and fondue. All were of extremely high quality. 
The only other thing I was disappointed about was the finisher mug. On the website it looked like it was ceramic but the actual finisher mug is made from thin, cheap plastic. Almost disposable. In fact, that's where a lot of the finisher mug ended up- in the trash can after the goodies were consumed. I brought mine home but it looks so cheap I don't know if I will display it. 
Overall, a very enjoyable way to spend the morning. I don't know if I will do this race again due to the parking issue~ but it is a fun race!
Was a little hesitant but I'm glad I tried it. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the portion sizes aren't that great compared to the price. Real nice variety including gluten and dairy free options. Probably be back because the wife loves the place. Don't go when you're starving and you'll love the place.
When I'm in the area definitely my go to BBT place. And bonus is their Taiwanese wheel cakes. Fave is the Vanilla but they have a secret menu option at Yonge and Finch with duck egg and taro.
Bonne musique , repas convenable et prix raisonnable .  Le service à la clientèle est normale .
It was Sunday night and I didn't feel like cooking. Since I was craving sushi I decided to peruse Just Eat and Foodora for some interesting options. I was impressed that Itamea delivered downtown. I mean, some dt adjacent neighbourhoods don't even deliver to us and this restaurant is all the way in Beaubien! Kudos to them.

While it's well-rated on Yelp, Facebook and Google reviews are terrible. Angry reviewers mostly complained about the service and long delivery time, so I was mentally ready to wait at least 2 hours. I was pleasantly surprised when the delivery arrived after only one hour (which is actually not fast, I know). 

I was really satisfied with my order. I tried the spicy salmon, the spicy scallop, Volcano, Golden Gate and Special Itamea makis. There were generous amounts of fish and avocado- most sushi restaurants will try to cheap out by loading up on tempura, but not here. 

Only complaint was that one of the quail eggs on my Rising Sun nigiri broke during delivery. They should put the quail eggs separately in a small plastic container to avoid this problem. Overall though, for delivery on a Sunday night, it really hit the spot.
So happy with Absolute Appliance Services in Henderson NV!  When my refrigerator stopped working, I was afraid that I would need to buy a new one.  Who wants to do that with the cost, landfill crowding, and likely shorter life-span on newer models.  Rom was Amazing!  Services were very timely and professional.   The repairs could be done quickly and when it worked with our schedule.  Rom was very nice and professional - we always felt comfortable having him in the house.  He was even helpful with food spoilage concerns.  Absolute Appliance Services is now in my contact list - ready for any repairs that we will need in the future.  We happily  highly recommend Absolute Appliance Services!
Having uncertainty when deciding whether you want thighs, breasts, tenders, drumsticks or a mashup of these?  No deciding here- chicken is one way at Raising Cane's & it's the right way!  Delicious combo options.  I'm not a chicken person, nope not even chicken fingers, however I crave Raising Cane's.  It's the Only time I do have chicken if any kind or combo.  The coleslaw is my absolute favorite! I will be honest and admit, I go here once a week order the large size of coleslaw and leave. It's addicting.  Yes, that dipping sauce they have is as well.  That sauce it probably why this is the only time I have chicken. No, no Texas toast for me- extra coleslaw it is!  I even dip the fries into that sauce.  Again, more coleslaw.  Then a chicken finger or two, dipped into the sauce.  No double dipping!  Extra dipping sauce as well- please;).
Good takeout or dine in option. Lots of "design your own" pizza sauces and toppings. Variety of salad options. Several kids meal selections (mac and cheese was YUMMY!). 

Order your food at the counter, grab a number and head to your table or wait for your take out. 

Good option for an easy, moderately priced lunch or dinner.
Inside the Venetian hotel, this is where you go to eat if:

1. You don't want to pay an arm and a leg at the higher end, celebrity chef restaurants
2. You're losing but you don't want your S. O. or family to know it
3. You are broke, but you don't want to eat Mall food in either of the 2 food courts
4. The dinner show was sold out
5. Cheesecake Factory is your favorite restaurant
6. You want to stay close to the "Wizard of Oz" slot machines in hopes of getting one when it opens up
7. You are tired of walking from the Sands Convention center all the way to your room, so you stop here to rest and eat

The Grand Lux Cafe is a moderately priced, large and usually noisy restaurant at the hub of activity in the Venetian. It is between the room elevators, the escalators to the self-park parking garage, some shops, an information and ticket buying booth for shows, and the casino floor, and near the grand walkway to the lobby.

It has a large menu with something for everyone, with most entrees around $15 - $25.  Very much like the Cheesecake Factory, since this restaurant was designed by the creators of the Cheesecake Factory, that ubiquitous faux fine dining restaurant so popular with the suburban mall rat crowd.

Actually, I had a pretty good salmon entree here, well presented and not too expensive. The two Gin and Tonics helped my enjoyment. 

Service is slower, though, but you should be able to find something reasonably tasty to satisfy your poor, tired soul here in the town that wasn't built on winners.

I forgot to see what Cheesecakes they offer here.
I know it's rare but...

After being let down by our original reservation with another big name car rental company who changed the location of our car pick up last minute (the day before our travel) my hubby had to scramble and book another car from another rental place.. FOX came through.

We took the shuttle from the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport to the car rental location. As we were making our way towards where the Fox counter was we were already dreading the long line that was formed in a snake line. When we got there, Yay! the long line was for Payless! There were 3 companies that shared the counter. I forgot what the other company was but Fox only had 1 customer ahead of us and there were two attendants behind the counter so we were immediately assisted by the second attendant. This was around 10:00p on a busy Friday night.

Anyway, we were able to get our reserved car. No hassles, no pressure on up sells, no hidden charges and service was friendly. They do require a $150 deposit refunded upon return of the car. 3 days with unlimited miles $81.29. Pick up and return from the car lot was easy as well. The car ran well and was a gas saver (first time driving a Toyota Prius). This isn't our first time renting with Fox but it is here in Phoenix location and we had a good experience with Fox this time.

Review #0606
Yes yes yes. 3 tacos, 5 bucks. The best was the carne asada. Great quality and flavor. Barbacoa was juicy and tender as it should be. I missed a bit of pineapple on the al pastor. For a quick bite or to go, hard to beat.
Great nightclub. Was escorted directly in by a promoter friend of a friend so not commenting on entry.

Dress code is standard club--look cute! #DUH

Hiphop room downstairs is WAY too small. WTF! lol

The only thing that I don't like is that if you don't have a table, there is no where to sit or "take a break" from dancing. Also the upstairs portion you can't even really look below to the main dance floor because the design has booths ALL the way around it. The stairs really throw me off too...I can see this as being disastrous for people who can't hang with partying. I was offered a table for $1K incl 2 bottles but passed because I really just wanted to check it out and hang for a bit before venturing to another spot.

Other than that, typical\/standard new club with a great sound system, lighting, and lots of people.
Imagine for a minute that you're waiting in a really long line. No, it's not the line ride. You see a menu on the wall with your ordering options, but before you are anywhere near someone that could take your order, you're yelled at.

"Hey! What do you want?"

Don't be afraid, but don't be surprised either. Keep your cool and order your dogs. Immediately start thinking about if you want fries or rings (onion rings) and be prepared for when you're called upon again. Then watch as your hot dog is mutilated in front of your eyes and what appears on your tray is what looks like a hot mess of decapitated food.

Never fear though... because it is amazing. Well worth the wait and one of the best dogs you'll ever have. My favorites here are the white hot and the bratwurst. Whenever I know I'm going, I end up salivating like Pavlov's dog for hours.

The booths are classic hot dog stand style and the pennants lined up along the top of the walls are fantastic to look at. One started a whole conversation and research one day about a basketball team we knew nothing about.
I really don't have much to say, since I grabbed a quick bite here for lunch. I had the shrimp tempera and salmon and avocado roll. Both were great - they tasted very fresh. The prices couldn't be better - $14 for lunch. The decor is cool - I know this sounds odd - but if you visit you have to check out the bathrooms - they are super cool.

The only thing I didn't like was that they didn't have that many signature\/special rolls. They probably had about 5\/6 different options when it came to special rolls and they seemed a little to far out there. Not what I would want included in my sushi. But then again, I am just a beginner, so maybe I am not open minded enough when it comes to sushi. Guess you will have to go visit and decide for yourself. Don't worry, it's worth the visit.
Never before have I experienced such a customizable pizza place, and I love it!  I especially appreciate the vegan cheese options, as well as the awesome selection of toppings.  So much fun, and so much deliciousness.  Can't wait to come back again!!
I am so glad this mall opened. It truly represents Summerlin and has all the stores you need. Don't miss Pandoras, or Sketchers or Trader Joes... I've been a regular visitor since its opening. Passing by today I noticed the ice skating ring is back up for the holidays. I can't skate, but I will take the family and watch. This is a great holiday tradition.
Nothing to special. They have a good steaks and a good but really pricey Caesar salad and interesting deserts. However the atmosphere, the service, the quality of food, just does not justify the prices they charge. I would have given the place 4 stars if it was more reasonably priced. But the prices they are charging it should be better all around.
We made reservations for Georges Brasserie for Queen's Feast weekend. It's the only restaurant we've chosen so far this time around. 

I was surprised to receive a phone call two days before our dinner to confirm our reservation. The caller asked me if I had an indoor\/outdoor seating preference, and reminded me that Queen's Feast was going on. Calling to confirm was a nice touch, just like reservations used to be way back in the good ol' days.

We were seated as soon as we arrived. Doug was our server, and he did a fantastic job. We brought a special wine from our cellar, which Doug uncorked and served to us. ($15 corkage fee.)  The service was absolutely perfect, from beginning to end.

More amazing than the splendid service, however, was the food. My husband ordered the mussels. I can't eat or try mussels because I have developed an allergy, so I can't say firsthand how they tasted, or even how the broth tasted. What I CAN say is that I've never seen my husband so happy about his food. I asked him if I needed to leave him and the mussels alone for a moment. My husband said, and I quote, "I have not had anything better since I had that escargot in Beaune, France." Now, you need to realize he puts that dinner in Beaune up on a pedestal. That's his baseline for ultimate perfection. So to put the mussels in that category was the highest compliment he's paid any restaurant in Charlotte, ever.

I had the Vichyssoise myself, and I loved it. I may not have had the affair with my first course that my husband had with his, but it was damned good. The best I've had in the area as well.

Our main courses were solid, but not as surprisingly awesome as the first course. My husband had the short ribs, which he liked, but said were on par with other places in town. I had the chicken (I know, I'm so BORING!) which I ordered  primarily because I was interested in the black garlic buerre blanc. It was delicious and I really enjoyed it.

We both agreed on flourless chocolate cakes for our dessert. Again with the ooh-ing and the aah-ing. My husband and I both agreed it was the best, and probably most rich, flourless chocolate cake we'd ever had. Perfectly moist, almost like a mousse, and very delicious. I appreciated that the raspberry coulis was an accent on the plate and not on the cake, as I don't like raspberries very much.

Based on that one meal, we will certainly be back for lunches and dinners. Georges Brasserie was hands-down, the nicest meal I've ever had for Charlotte Restaurant week. You have another week to get there, so make your reservations. It's the best!
Absolutely one of my favorite places in all of Las Vegas.  I've gone here several times and have not once has the display not amazed me.  It's a very welcome respite from the drinking, gambling, smoking crap that the rest of the Strip offers.  Beautiful (and very real!) flowers fill this room, along with waterfalls, animal and\/or flower sculptures, and fish.  Best part of all, it's completely free, you can take as many pictures as you want, and it's open 24\/7 (except when they're redoing the displays).  They change the garden from season to season, and also for holidays, so it's something you can see many times and never have a repeat experience, whether you're a local or a tourist.  If you're coming from Las Vegas Boulevard, walk straight in the front doors, and it's just past the lobby; trust me, you'll thank me later.
Best place after an all night bender the portion is HUGH!! and food full of flavors.  Half the menu is either topped, filled or wrapped in bacon  The line is long, the wait is about 20mins.  Servers very hospitable.  Price is proportioned to the dish size.
What an unbelievably amazing place to go. This is by-far my favorite place to go on a slower night rather than the party scene. Go in there have a few delicious exotic beers and talk to some down-right friendly people. The owner Pete is awesome as well. All the waiters, waitresses, bar tenders, and of course Pete make you feel like family who just got home. It's an absolutely wonderful place to go. BE SURE TO TRY A DARK AND STORMY DOWN THERE!
They make their own ice cream. Boba flavor\/texture is perfect (sweet and chewy), and I'm pleased with exotic flavors such as ginger, sesame, taro, red bean, etc. The price start from 3 bucks\/a scoop of ice cream, and they have frequent customer rewards (buy 9 drinks, 10th one on the house). I certainly wish this business to do well. Open til 2am, and they do deliver.
This morning I was up early and decided to treat myself to brunch I settled on Zada Janes which is located in the trendy neighborhood of Plaza Midwood this place is extremely popular b\/c I waited about 20 minutes before I was seated and another 20 minutes before my food came out. I decided to try the "basic breakfast" I chose the eggs, soysage, whole wheat toast with a pancake, with sweet potatoe bites I must say that it was delish. The serving size was just enough to fill me up without being too full the waitress was also sweet and attentive. The only cons to this place was that there was no organization as far as checking into this place for brunch and the wait was a bit long other than that it will become a regular spot for me.
Southern Spirits wins 4 stars ("Yay! I'm a fan.") from me for a few reasons: 1 - I can go to SS, purchase alcohol, and be back in my nice suburban home consuming it in under 10 minutes. 2 - There's a fireworks store in the parking lot, and if that doesn't scream South Carolina brilliance\/insanity then nothing else does. 3 - Their prices are pretty good, with discounts for cash, and I can find everything I want there, and more. Finally, if you want Hawaiian-style shave ice, or classic Carolina barbecued pork butt and\/or ribs, you can get it in the parking lot of Southern Spirits. (The "Tropical Sno" is available every day throughout the summer, and Gilb's barbecue is there on the weekends.)

There are some negatives, that cause me to dock them at least one star. First, at least on the beer side, the cashiers can be surly. I've been going there at least once a week for about five years now, and it's still hit or miss if the cashier woman, who has seen me at least 100 times, will smile at me or grimace and not even give me a second glance.

Second, their hours suck. They close at 7PM during the week and on Saturdays. Half the time I usually know we'll need another bottle or a six pack for some folks dropping by after the time at which they have closed. And they aren't open on Sundays - stupid, ridiculous, stinking blue laws... which frankly shoot the state in the foot when it comes to revenue.

Frankly, I don't care much if they're surly, I'll still return to Southern Spirits for the convenience. I keep my expectations low, which make days like today a great surprise! Apparently they were stocked up to the gills for the Labor Day weekend - no sooner had I pulled my 12-pack from the fridge, a young man was behind me asking me if he could carry it to the register. And when I checked out, I had a more senior (she's the manager, I think) woman who rang me up for $10.25 and when I plopped $11 on the counter, she whipped out a quarter from her own pocket and gave me my dollar back.

Regardless of the attitude you (might) get, they're down home folks, and you're supporting local business (rather than the Wal-Mart) so I will always keep going to Southern Spirits!
My wife and I have recently ate here twice in the same week. Love the atmosphere, Great food, prices are reasonable, happy hour is fun with great specials and decent discounts. Oh, the service was great as well!
Nothing mind blowing, but a very solid sushi place nonetheless. The servers are prompt and polite. The food portions are very generous and well prepared. Sashimi slices are just humongous, and even my female friend had a difficult time fitting a whole piece of their signature roll into her mouth (and believe me, she has a _big_ mouth ;). I especially enjoyed their Eel Dragon roll with avocado, but then again I've always been a sucker for eel... Anywho, really nothing to complain about. The place even has a nice ambience to it if you get seated deeper and along the right wall (there's some funky red lighting there that I liked).
I just bit into a staple in my RCK Original box. Sorry but I won't be returning to RCK!
We got off to a questionable start as we were sat several minutes after our reservation time.  It was not a deal breaker, but it was annoying.  Our server was prompt and friendly.

The bread is very good.  It is hard not to fill up on it before your meal comes.  We ordered a few appetizers for the table.  I tried the mozzarella marinara.  It was surprisingly good.  Most places you can tell the mozzarella was pulled from the freezer right before it was fried.  The mozzarella here had good flavor, and the portions are good sized.

To start off my meal I ordered the side portion of the Maggiano's Salad.  I always enjoy this salad.  The house dressing has good flavor.  The blue cheese and bacon add great flavors too.  The portion is large.

For my main course I ordered the veal Parmesan.  The portion is huge.  It comes with a side of spaghetti as well.  The veal is ok as far as flavor is concerned.  I have had better, but it was fine.
This was our first visit to Trattoria Antica since it's opening a couple of years ago. The fact we waited for a return visit suggest our first impressions. After reading countless 4-5 star reviews we decided to try TA again. Our server was pleasant, an interesting Italian accent and prompt delivery of wine and fresh crusty bread. We each ordered a  Parmesan entree, one chicken and one veal. We also shared a Caesar salad.  

The shared salad was fresh romaine, a small amount of bland dressing and a very very dry anchovy. Quite disappointing! The chicken P was a generous portion covered with bland sauce and under melted mozzarella cheese. The breading was rather soggy. The veal was a smaller porting albeit adequate with similar bland sauce and under melted cheese.

We asked for some additional bread, as the oil and white bean app was very tasty. Unfortunately this serving of bread was from yesterday and was crusty in a bad way. 

We also asked for additional sauce because the perfectly cooked pasta was barely dress. More sauce was a mistake as we hadn't tasted it as yet. You got it bland. 

For an Italian restaurant to call this red liquid a marinara sauce must be an acquired taste.....similar to that served in the high school cafeteria.  

Waxhaw's restaurant scene needs all the quality restaurants we can get but other than their convenient location TA won't see us back anytime soon especially at their inflated prices.
I've been here multiple times and I'm fed up with this place. I never would trust these guys again. I have had them work on my bikes for about a year now and I'm just realizing how bad of a job they do. They take a week to do the work another bike place can do in 10 minutes. I had them work on the breaks on my bike and when they gave it back to me with the breaks dragging and they don't even work, when I pull them in they don't even stop the bike. Also, I have had them true back my wheel multiple times too. The wheel gets warped back to how it was 2 times after riding it after having them true it back.  When I took it to another bike shop down the street, this place charged me much less, did it in 10 minutes and I haven't had any problems with it since then. I will never be letting these guys touch my bikes again. I Do not recommend this place to anyone
Love Love Love this theater\/ Lucky for me it is very close ..Its like a quiet retreat theater. Always very clean, and let me talk to you about the comfortable seating. Lately there has been some very LONG movies, and there seating is so lush and wonderful. You can get a glass of wine or a beer also. Very adult type theater. I would score this a Full Five Stars. In fact--going back today!! Try it..you won't be disappointed!
Coffee was great! Service and wait, not so much. Cool hipster spot but I wasn't impressed with the cashier's short, snide attitude or the lengthy wait. Wish the service had been better - because of it, I don't feel the need to return.
Un des meilleurs sandichs que j'ai mangé á Mtl! Ils sont bon et pas cher! Beaucoup de choix de viandes. Ils sont tellement populaires qu'il est préférable appeler avant pour commander!
I like this B&N mainly because of the great children section upstairs. I like going there with my son and spend a couple of hours browsing and reading. They have a nice table there with chairs kid size where you can read with your child. And the employees don't seem to mind when you are reading out loud. Some days there are kids getting tutored there. They also have a decent collection of kid toys. Overall, it's a good store at a good location. I read a couple of reviews about the lack of parking. If you swing around to their "back" side from where there is also an entrance, there are more parking spaces that are open there.
Great friendly people who really care about your recovery.

Was seen quick and promptly but was not rushed through process.

There is a reason they are highly regarded in the ortho community. I highly recommend this place!
I have been to this location a few times and in the past we did not have the best experience due to poor service. Happy to say we had great service this time around. Food was good as usual and it came out quickly. We shared the 3 dip appetizer (their hummus and baba ganoush are must orders) and the chicken breat skewers with mashed potato and house salad.
Decided to stop by to grab some ice coffee and of course every Starbucks is busy and drive through is packed. But they had open seats in the patio, so decided to hang out a little. 

Ordered, ice coffee and lemon pound cake. Honestly can't go wrong that
The staff here is so knowledgable about their products, and they actually care about helping you find exactly what you need! I called to ask if they had a certain green superfood powder in stock and Stephan looked and said they were out of it. Okay, end of phone call. Not two minutes later, Stephan called back to let me know that he found some in the back inventory and he would hold it for me! Such great customer service! Another guy helped me find alternatives to the artificially colored pre-workouts, and 'stack' my own. I really love this place and am thankful it's in my neighborhood. Blows its competitors out of the water in terms of customer service.
Cam here with 16 other friends during Nuit Blanche because scaddabush next door was full. I like that it's easy to get a last minute seating for that many people. It seems to be a very loud sports bar. One of those places that you go and have a drink before going to clubs. Ordered the clam chowder as an appetizer. I was expecting it to be thick and creamy, but it seems to have more water than cream. So, that was disappointing. Then, I got the lamb for my main course. It was just a standard slow cooked lamb. Boring and unoriginal. Taste is ok, but it feels expensive paying $50 or so for dinner when served something that boring. I doubt that I will be coming back unless I'm eating with a big group.

Food stored outdoors, in the open, in an alley
So I have been here a couple times now and I am finally writing a review. I am completely dissatisfied with this place. It is called a lounge and when you walk in it looks and acts like one. It has really nice accent lighting that calms you down and prepares you for a fun night. Until you see all the broskis and college type clientele. 

Now don't get me wrong I understand this is downtown and college kids like the place and all but it is a lounge. Even the staff is dressed pretty well to make it feel like a really classy place. The establishment is deceivingly small and they make it seem 10X bigger by using large mirrors on the walls but you realize quickly that the place is small, at least on the lower level... The reason I address this is because every time I have been here they had the upstairs closed for some unknown reason. When I asked the "bouncer" why it was closed he said it is only for when they are really busy, while I was being shoved around because everyone was shoulder to shoulder and on a saturday night... 

The bartenders are inattentive and thats being kind, they are just shouting at all their friends and buddies who come in and give them special treatment even though I had been sitting there for about 20 minutes, NO that is not an exaggeration. When they come back with their friends' drinks they blatantly try handing shots over me and spilling on me. They apologize but don't offer anything in return and STILL WALK AWAY. The last time I was there and this happened I yelled at the bartender to get my beer and get the manager. The manager gave me my beer and a shot for free but this almost offends me. I am not easily bought like the rest of the drunken people there and I don't expect free stuff. Of course I didn't get another drink for a while after that but that's why I left $2 for my over $40 tab. Some might think it is rude but what are you really tipping those people for? More people tip better at the bar than at a restaurant... Who is doing more work? A server? or some person who literally makes 3 movements to hand you something... 

Probably do not plan on returning to this place unless there is minimal people.
The food was amazing! Service was outstanding! Every time we come to town, we'll be making a stop her.
This is a fairly good convention center. It is relatively new looking. It is located right in the middle of downtown near hotels and food options. The food court is large. That being said it is inconvenient if you are on the main floor two levels up. There are some decent options for quick food, but it would be nice if there were at least a couple options near the show floor area.

There were some food options inside the show area. These bring down the overall score. The line was tragically long and the options were severely limited. The long lines are likely a reflection of the food court being so far away.
Came here for my first time ever tanning and they were extremely polite and helpful when I was picking my package. It was always clean and welcoming. They also provide eyebrow and upper lip waxing services, which most people do not know about. I was satisfied with my wax there and would recommend it for a close spot on campus.
I came here for a quick lunch with my boyfriend near our jobs and was definitely impressed! Location is great, right off of Baseline and 24th street inside the same complex as Wal Mart, Taco Bell, Jersey Mike's and Chipotle. The restaurant was clean and staff was very friendly. I ordered the spinach and goat cheese salad and picked at my boyfriend's "smashed" sweet potato fries. Smashed fries include rosemary and other spices...mmm! The sweet potato fries in general are really good! My salad was awesome, I've had their burger and chicken sandwiches before and everything I have had is great! Prices are a little steep (almost $20 for 2 at lunch without drinks) but good food indeed! Will be back!
I payed a visit to this location's drive thru today and really wasn't impressed.

When I arrived at the window to pay for the order I placed the guy opened the window and just stared at me. I had to ask him how much I owed so that I could pay for my order. I guess he just assumed I could understand anything he might have uttered through their high quality drive thru speakers.

The drive through service was extremely slow. This is one of those places that make you wish you would have parked and walked in because you probably would have gotten your food faster.

The food was typical McDonalds...nothing special.
One of my favourite places to eat for good sandwiches, soup and pastries.  The one by Sherway is my go to location.  The people working there are friendly and the service is good.  The locations have a nice warm feel to them as if you're at a cottage minus the urban jungle when you look out the window.  As soon as I walk in I get excited about the sandwiches and I'm not a big bread eater.  In the US I'd say their menu is a little different and a little better but it's still good here. 
The ingredients in their sandwiches taste fresh and compliment each other well.  The soups taste homemade and not like they're out of a can.  The pastries are a little more of a hit and miss for me.  I enjoy their chocolate croissants but their cookies are average.  Whenever I'm on a road trip going through the states Panera Bread is my favourite place to stop off and grab some food.  The coffee is average as well but that's because I like Starbucks coffee. 
If you're ever passing one and you're wondering about how it is, stop and give it a try because there are lots of options and it's delicious.
Love this place and the coffee is so good! I don't usually care for being a coffee snob but I honestly can drink it black because it's so good. Expected prices to be too high for me but they are really fair. Medium coffee is $2 and lattes are $3-4. It's also great to support the new business. Highly recommend trying this out and supporting the local business.
This chapel was amazing.Perfect for a small little ceremony. Deshawn was a great help in helping us decide what package would work best for us. Then Esme assisted me and my hubby to find a dress and tux to fit our wants. I'm so picky and Esme really found a dress that I loved. The officiant was very friendly as well. After our ceremony we took some pictures and got to take a look at them. Our package included 10 pics. But we asked the photographer for all of them and we wanted the video as well so the photographer hooked us up with a great deal for both ( just ask the photographer). The limo even picked us up! Everything was basically a one stop shop and made everything so easy! I will definitely recommend this place. From the customer service to the overall experience 5 stars all the way!
This is my current preferred place to satisfy my Japanese dessert craving because the line at uncle tetsu's is still ridiculous. 

I love their green tea mille crepe, although it is not at lady m's level. If lady m's mille crepe is about looking and tasting like french patisserie, the mille crepe here is about a what-if-your-japanese-mom\/beau made a mille crepe for you. Basically, it tasted homey and full of love(as cliche as that sounds).

I was going to drop a star or two, but this place just wouldn't let me do it. One day, I came for a slice of their green tea mille crepe, but before I could dig in, I noticed that there's what look like a HAIR(!!!) sticking out from between the crepe layers. I let the girls know and like me, they're also making 'eeeww' faces and sound, but in japanese. 

They looked so apologetic and offered me a free scoop of ice cream (I chose their khao san thai ice tea flavor, which tasted amazing btw). All this happened around closing times, in other places in Toronto, that would be the usual I-wanna-go-home bitchy time. I was impressed by their service, hence I couldn't drop a star even with the hair on my food.
*The restaurant itself is located inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel and the entrance on Colborne street was super easy to be missed\/ 
*Although it was still bright outside, the restaurant was dimly lighted which resulted into very bad quality pictures lol...
*Upon arriving, we were given the Groupon menu and were told that we could select one of the 4 types of either wine or beer which were included on the Groupon menu.
*the service here was amazing and the servers constantly refilled my water and always made sure we were okay with our food.
*The normal price is already quite steep, with that said I thought the $90 groupon was still expensive considered the quality of food here. Don't get me wrong, it's a good deal but I believe you can pay a bit more and receive better food in restaurants around the area.

-Hors D'oeuvres: The Hors D'oeuvres were freshly made and changed daily based on what's in season. It came with:

--Polenta fries: though not as good as the ones I had at Richmond Station, it still had a nice crust, soft and creamy on the inside.
--Pulled pork with salsa: dry and bland
--Vegetarian spring rolls: really good! The sauce added a nice kick and it was crunchy.
--Smoke salmon with shrimps: I could barely tasted the smoke salmon, the shrimps were cooked well and it was topped with mayonnaise (I think).

-Escargots Provencal (herbed butter, roasted garlic shallots, panko topping)
For appetizer I got the escargots and while they were soft and tender, I thought the dish was too oily but had a really strong buttery taste (in a good way!). The panko topping added some crunches with every bite and the sauce wasn't too garlicky, overall a well-made appetizer.

-P.E.I Mussels (steamed in a spicy tomato sauce or garlic cream sauce)
it would have been nice if some bread was served on the side to soak up all that delicious broth! These were decent sized mussels with no empty shells, so that means the mussels did not have any muscles to escape... get it?  Anyhow the cream sauce was incredibly flavorful and had just enough kick to it, and if it was socially acceptable, I would have licked the bowl clean.

-Wildfire back ribs with grilled shrimps (house cut fries, seasonal vegetables)
While the ribs were nice and tender, it wasn't the fall-off-the-bone type and was a bit bland. I devoured the grilled shrimps since they were probably the best part of the dish as the fries were a bit limp...

-10oz New York strip loin (garlic mashed potatoes, seasonal vegetables)
The steak had a perfect medium-rare temperature but it was under-seasoned. The mashed potatoes was too salty and had no garlic taste to it. The steak came with some  well-cooked broccoli, roasted red pepper and zucchini.

-Decadent Chocolate torte (house made flourless Belgian chocolate torte)
The texture of chocolate torte was similar to a brownie, it was rich but somehow still remained light. Though it was too sweet for my taste, I appreciated how they used dark chocolate instead and if there was more raspberry sauce to cut down the sweetness, it would have been perfect!

-Wildfire Creme Brule (vanilla custard made with Madagascar vanilla beans)
The creme brule had a nice sugar coating on top and the custard had a nice texture, yet it suffered the same problem as the previous dessert - overly sweetened.
KC fried chicken is the best! Located inside Concord Mills Mall. Great for a cold one while you're shopping. Massive sandwich menu and good service.
Great service every time I come here!  Not a lot on the menu but that makes it easy to decide.  The chicken, special sauce, and Texas toast are amazing!  Not the greatest fries but everything else makes up for it.  Hoping one day they put one in North West Peoria!
Place is gourgous but you can't get a cheap drink anywhere.  Even the sports bar is upper crust.
So glad I found this little gem per co-workers recommendations. It's hard to find a sushi restaurant in Vegas that's authentic, moderately priced, and not AYCE. Sushi Hiroyoshi has sushi combos and sashimi combos for $16 - $40, omakase starts at $65, as well as other items such as black cod miso (~$9). So whether you want to splurge a little or just get some decently priced , high quality sushi, this place is definitely worth a try!
I like the Mt. Lebanon location more, I think.  Sq Hill was always so busy.  I like the unique menu, good service, and I don't miss the naucious feeling that you sometimes get from some restaurants.
Hula's is vibrant and lovely! It's most def a modern take on retro tiki. And they have two dollar mimosas for weekend brunch, y'all! 

That's all you need to know about brunch, which is a good thing considering it's pretty bland. We tried the Island Eggs Benedict ($10, with the kielbasa) and the Hula's Hangover Hash ($9). The eggs benedict were done very well, but nothing really sets this dish apart from one you could get anywhere else, even with the atypical meat choices. 

It was the Hawaiian pulled pork hash that was a total bummer on the plate. The hashbrowns were practically black in some places and mushy in others, and the pulled pork was a mass of dry, bland shredded meat. To top it off, the eggs were done over hard with no runny yolk goodness. Suck.

Probably will not return for brunch, but mimosas and tacos may be in my future! The Tiki Time happy hour also shows promise.
Great, prompt, efficient service from Larson. Leo provided great service on my 10 year old ac unit and walked me through things to consider in the next year or so, given the unit's age and status ... especially now that I've relocated from the Midwest and am about to face my first summer here. Thank you, Larson, I've got a good vendor I can count on.
Really surprising good Guadalajara food.  We had the special which was whole Tilapia fried with salad and fries. Could have left off the fries and provided chips, but the fish was excellent!  Also had a couple of shredded beet tacos, very tasty!

Give it a try. Small place, only 10 tables. But quick friendly service.
This place is not my favorite pest control. Even with the coupon you get very little service for your money. They are not eager to stand by the service and refused to come out and retreat the areas of my home where there were signs of pests.  Unless I paid an additional $200!
5 Stars *****

Yes. It was that good. It was some of the best poke I have had in Vegas. They don't smother the fish in sea salt and oil like some places do. You can actually taste the fish. They also fried us some tofu, which was not on the menu. That was nice of them. The yellowtail hand roll and the dragon roll were also excellent.

The kitchen and dining area were very clean. The staff was very friendly. It was definitely worth the drive from Summerlin. I recommend that you stop in and have some poke or whatever else you care to try. I will be back!!
UofT staple, price is ok, food is meh. Service is a hit or miss. If you're not working on a final just go to Chinatown.
Nice breakfast spot and convenient that they offer a drive-thru. It does get busy so be prepared to wait in line for a while in the drive-thru, especially on the weekends. Big fan of the California breakfast sandwich. Some of their frozen coffee drinks are a little milky and watered down -- I like my coffee drinks STRONG! Still, overall, a very nice breakfast option.
Came here for a burger as one of my friends said they had good burgers and people from work would come by twice a month for a burger run.

Ordered the original was was ok, wasn't as amazing as everyone says it to be. I think the veggie option would have been better.

A little pricy for a take-out burger.
Man I just love the chicken shawarma sandwich. I call ahead and then pick it up. Great combo of coriander spice, sauce and pickle with parsley. Every single person to whom i have introduced this sandwich has become a diehard fan. Try it, you will thank me!
After eating there 3 times with a few of the pickiest eaters i know, i can say the food is truly outstanding.  Had an excellent experience for both lunch and dinner.  Offers a very creative and eclectic menu, not to mention the nice ambiance.  Terrific service as well.  Very reasonably priced-- been to Vegas over a dozen times-- for this quality food and atmosphere, First, by far, offers the best value in Vegas.  Wish i could give it 6 stars!
Hey Brah!

Super sweet little dive-y billiards bar hiding near the heart of Plaza Midwood. Cheap beer served by not-the-friendliest bartenders. Patio off the side that lets you enjoy some fresh air. It's a great spot to get away from the hustle and bustle.
I've been through in on a number of occasions and have never had a problem.

Food is typical Mcdonalds and it's always hot so nothing to complain about here. The drive through is usually fast. 

As for whether or not the staff is friendly, I usually go here early in the morning, so I really don't care. I'm not friendly myself in the morning LOL     So as long as my order arrives promptly and they don't talk much and my coffee is hot  I'm good with it.
Over the years DTG has been getting more fun. The Blues Festival, Choclate, Glendale Glitters to name a few. The shops that have survived the recession pretty good. More seem to be coming back as well. I am glad to be a Glendale resident, and look forward to many more years of fun stuff in DTG.
a few years ago, this used to be the place to be for bunch. I was really excited to take my boyfriend here to experience one of the "must visit places in MTL". Boy were we disappointed!

We had ordered the eggspectation omelette and eggs benedict. The omelette was bland, overcooked. The eggs benedict were ok, but I've had better. The portion size has come down.

Overall, food and service has gone downhill and not worth my time anymore.
My 1st review!  Yay had a holiday party and i couldnt have been more excited to find this place! Best stock of party stuff and good cutomer service, will come back.
A dab of fab here at the Dhaba... I couldn't resist!  If the only Naan you've had is from Trader Joe's , trust me on the advice to try the homemade version here!!!!

My guy and I have tried this spot twice and I know he loves it so we will be back.

The menu is ridiculously huge and nothing is a dumb downed name though they do have a description of everything.

I try the vegetarian combo (not remembering the name) that included a yummy salad, chai tea, vegetable curry, lentils, jasmine rice, and an order of naan for $15.  Seriously this place is legit!!  Why?

Food temps- hot when it's supposed to be!

Flavors- beautifully seasoned and delicious savory Indian flavors

Serving size- I pigged out and still had a full meal the next day

Authenticity- badass decor, tableware with live music sets the tone

We learned they do the last dinner seating at 8 so if you are going to get there a bit after you should call and make a reservation for 8:15.  We barely got in at 8:05 but saw another group turned away.  Yelp lists the hours until 9:30 maybe that is for the adjoining market.
I've been here about five times. First time was shortly after the museum opened. That time I figured I would be in and out in an hour. NOT the case, it was better than what I anticipated. Loved the machine gun, the small side room with a movie and those seats made out of 'barrels'!  The staff is friendly and entertaining upon entering. Be sure and peruse the gift shop!
Mediocre food for dirt cheap prices great if you're going out to get s*** house drunk. Close to all sorts of other places to get that done. This location can be very busy so try to avoid weekends and after work dinner times if you are super hungry.
Awsome place. See cindy shes great for nails. You have to have the deluxe pedi done...the hot rocks are wonderful.

Call before going in esp on weekend as they do get really busy.
Love this little spot in the Mile-ex. Foods really good. I had the gazpacho, risotto and a few of the balls yum! 
The only thing that ruined my night and worth taking a star off was the place has no AC! I was coming from work with my shirt, jacket, long pants, socks and shoes! Had I been in a t-shirt, shorts and flip flops I could've bared it much better! Not a summertime place recommended for business clients at al ! Besides that, I would for sure go back... flip flops and all!
ps, heads-up to the owners: I like that you're serving cocktails in regular glasses, but when you order a dirty martini and it looks like a shot you kind of feel cheated! cheers
I love Triple Sports.  Everyone is always extremely helpful - going the extra mile to help me find what I need.  They are also incredibly supportive and encouraging, helping to push me to the next level of competition in the wonderful sport of triathlons.  I love the fact that Brian and Kara, the owners, have completed numerous triathlons including the Ironman.  And, the best part is that you don't have to be famous to be appreciated by these guys.  They treat all athletes equally whether you are a beginner or Pro!
I needed a door panel replaced. I sent out quote requests to a few handymen on Yelp. Jamie was the first to reply and within minutes. He's easy to communicate with, all via text and he quoted a fair price and was available the following weekend. He's really nice, respectful, honest and did an amazing job. So much so that I had him come out the following weekend and repair some drywall in the house. I highly recommend Jamie, if you are looking for an honest handyman who is prompt and provide a great service, then he is your guy!
The mini kobe sliders were delicious.
The man wanted a beer, I wanted FHC - worked out.
His chili cheese dog came out a reincarnation of the bachelorette dog - I didn't taste it - but the chili-cheese was ok tasting.
I tried the heirloom tomato salad this time around- which had beautiful tomatoes, a sprinkle of basil and generous burrata. I'd split that with someone next time. Normally, I don't mention sweet potato fries - but for some reason Serendipity3 has theirs perfect.
First of all, I am not a chain restaurant guy.  Growing up in Manhattan and eating out almost every weekend.  Wasn't until I moved to pitt that I even considered trying this place but due to the lack of steakhouses I wasn't getting my "proper" fix so I had to.  Couldnt be happier that I made that initial decision.  Consistency is just what you get at The Capital Grille.  Superior service and a consistently delicious meal.  Expensive but for the quality of the steak Id say its well worth the trip.  If you want extraordinary service ask for Horacio, he will make your evening memorable and treat you like royalty.  Beautiful decor as well and not only is your server great but the entire staff is extremely attentive.
That moment when your mechanic tells you not to keep repairing your old 1984 Mercury grand marquis...

So here I am helping my uncle find a nice reliable inexpensive car.  He's not really wanting a car very much and actually gets into a disagreement with our mechanic who has done business with our family for over 20 years.

We walk into hertz on Bell because there's a yellow Kia Soul my uncle likes after seeing it on the website. 

Bruce helps us over the course of the day- pulling cars up into the shade awning just steps outside the as so my uncle can sit in them.  He is upfront with prices and clear on the fact you can't haggle with hertz.

We like an Elantra and take it over for our mechanic to look at. After we get the ok we go back to try to write a deal.  We go back and forth on APR a few times and manage to put enough down to get the payment he's comfortable with.

The final signing is straight forward and quick- no bs here!!! My reason for 5 stars is the paperwork was accurate and no extended warranties or gap insurance were mentioned.  All the typical deal rip of tactics were removed and we could leave in peace!!

I recommend this store to buy a 2 or 1 year old car just be sure to ask about any accidents the car has been in.  No matter how minor an accident you cannot foresee the small issues that could become more long term.

Also hertz overs a 12 month warranty and the Kia we went with still has 25,000 miles left on the warranty as well.

My uncle is a new person with his new car- now he has a radio and an ac in a zippy red car!  He has offered other family members rides and even bought a logo shade screen at the dealership.

I highly recommend this car shopping experience especially for those who don't want a hassle.
The pear salad is awesome! Pizza is
Always great! Wish they had a bigger wine selection but always good eats!
Had about an hour and a half to kill before my next flight. We stoped in here for lunch and got a nice juicy burger, it was really good. Also got their Octoberfest beer and it was pretty good too. Only thing I would change is that for the price I could have used some more french fries with the meal and the bun on the burger just seemed kinda like the cheep frozen kind, and a little small for the burger, but I enjoyed my meal and watching football on the screens and even got a pint glass with their logo to take home.
The food is not bad, and reasonably priced.  Wish the service weren't so bad.  Another party of two, who arrived after us, was seated before us.  Once we pointed out that fact, the hostess acted like we were putting her out.  Then she seated us right by the kitchen, despite the fact that there were about six other open tables.  The waitress, who was pretty competent, told me that I could not substitute fruit for potatoes, something I feel is pretty common.  The busboy asked me three times if he could clear my plate, while I was obviously still eating.  The volume on the music was so uneven that, for some songs, I could hardly hear my companion.  I got the feeling that a lot of the employees were on coke or meth.  The strawberry jam was really good, though.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go back.
Absolutely incredible food and service! Easily the best caprese salad I've ever had and the restaurant itself was cozy and intimate with very nice employees. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for good authentic Italian in old Montreal!
This place was good but it definitely doesn't have the "best tasting burger in America" as they claim on their drink cups. Ordered the superfood salad which was a generous portion but I didn't love the salad dressing it came with so I ordered a side of balsamic vinaigrette. The double char cheeseburger was good but I wasn't a huge fan of the fries. They didn't have much seasoning and were just kind of thick and bland. 

To me, this place has an upgraded fast food vibe to it. Which is fine if you go in expecting it. You can see the cooks throw the frozen burger patties onto the grill in front of you so you kind of know what you're getting. I did really enjoy their special house lemonade because it had fresh fruit and cucumber floating in it that provided a nice flavor. It did need to be poured over ice because I originally tasted it straight from the serving jug and it was lukewarm. 

Overall, descent food but not anywhere I am dying to run back to.
Let's start with good news! BT Burger is now American Burger. The onion rings are a must have when you visit. The burgers & fries tasted like they were left over from lunch. Unfortunately it was dinner time. Folks that came in after us, waited longer for their food than we did and I witnessed fresh burgers being placed on the grill. Fries are served in an oversized basket, served mildly warm and weren't enough to share. Did I mention the crispy onion rings? The saving grace was we used coupons but I expect AB to go the way of BT's if this is the best they got~:-(
While being seated, hostess realized no table was ready. We had to stand in the dinging room for 10 minutes while others worked around us.

Food order was taken even before we got our first drink.

Main course was served not more than 5 minutes after our appetizers arrived.  One person at our table had not even received her salad yet. 
 
One entree was served after several persons were already done with dinner.

We specifically asked for a candle to celebrate a birthday. Dessert served was wrong and with no candle.  

Manager apology "We were not as busy as usual so the kitchen's rhythm is off tonight."  What?  really?

The first bill we received was at the full price..we had to ask for a partial refund.

AVOID this place.
Pizza slices as big as your face!! No joke. Had the chicken parm sub and a slice of pepperoni and sausage. I was really impressed with both. The pizza slice came out perfectly crisp and the sausage was excellent. It had a nice bite of fennel to it. The chicken parm sub was good but could have used a little more sauce.
The buns they use for their burgers are the best part about the meal. light fluffy and slightly sweet - yum! 

Their menu is long and they have some great combinations of burger. Yay for having multiple types of vegetarian burgers that's been a first for me! I enjoyed my burger but it wasn't anything particularly special. I got a fries on the side which were really a disappointment as they were cold, oily and slightly bitter. 

They have a selection of hummus plates I want to go back as it was a big part of their menu and maybe the best thing they have to offer. 

If you do go keep in mind that this isn't really an intimate or date spot. There is a large billiards table and the restaurant itself is quite bare. I think they're going for more of a casual dining \/ bar feel with the place. It works well!
Good steaks at a great price.

This place is a diner\/dive\/trucker spot.  You're not coming here for the decor or ambiance, but the good steaks for an unbeatable price and that's why I'm giving it 4 stars, good food and great value. (I'm a fan of Diners Drive-In and Dives so ambiance is not my thing)

A $10 12 oz NY steak? When you hear that, I know you're thinking "this has got to be some Taco Bell, Grade F beef"... well, that's what I thought when I drove past. But after a friend convinced me to come here, I can tell you, it's definitely not. You get a quality steak (they have a ton of choices, NY, Rib, Porterhouse, T-bone, etc.) or chicken, smoked ribs, pulled pork, or even soulvaki for a great price.

I had a 12 oz Rib steak + baby back ribs with fries and a draft beer for $22 all in. Seriously. 

The steak was cooked to my liking (rare) and they cooked it perfectly.  The steak doesn't have much seasoning on it, but you can add bbq sauce or pepper to it if you want.  I wouldn't say "Keg quality" like other posts, but the cook knows his stuff, and the meat is good.  The ribs were also pretty tasty and tender.  

You can also get a 12 oz draft beer for $2.10, I don't know how you can beat that. 

They have a pretty wide array of menu items (makes me wonder how they stock\/prepare all these meats, and if they have enough turnover to get through their smoked meats) and I'll definitely be back to try some other items, such as a pulled pork sandwich with fries for $6.99, Beef ribs with a side for $11, Del Monico steak (on special) with a side for $12. 

If you're in the area and you have a carnivore craving and don't mind a diner type setting, I'd suggest it.

UPDATE:
I tried the Del Monaco steak + fries + onion rings. They won't let you sub fries for onion rings (you can only sub fries for salad), so I just got it as an additional side.  

I don't like the cut of the Del Monaco, they charge more for it, but it's a thinner cut so I'd stick with the rib eye. The fries are good here, but I'd pass on the onion rings as well. Cheap for $2.50, but they use a thick batter so it's very doughy. Stick with the fries!
A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!  I can't say enough good things about this place!  I first discovered this lil gem barhopping with a friend of mine and was completely in awe of the whole ambiance of the place.  The entrance is a narrow stone stairway that leads down to a small bar area with a couple of booths and seats in front of a fireplace.  Completely underground and secluded from the chaotic world above.  We had a drink and went on our way to Richardson's next door which was also amazing, but that's a whole other review.  My second experience was when my best friend and I planned our birthday dinner with our guys.  She made our reservations and requested one of the booths, which we were accomodated with.  Our server was great, she was friendly and very attentive.  We ordered chicken skewers as our appetizer, I had the chicken schnitzel, my best friend had the pork adobada, and the guys both ordered the prime rib.  All were delicious!  The prime ribs were huge!  We had a great time.  It's a quiet lil hole in the wall bar\/restaurant.  Great for catching up with a friend over drinks or a date night!  I can't wait to go again!
A must stop for my wife and I. Come 3 to 4 times a year when in town to see the Jays. I cant get enough of the curry chicken mango roti while my wife loves the chicken tika marsala roti. Place is nothing to look at but for the best roti I have ever had I cant praise this place enough. Go Jays!
Standard Olive Garden which is nice because you know exactly what you're getting: A-OK food and service. Ordered ahead and still had to wait - but it was prime dinner\/pickup rush hour so I guess that's to be expected. 

Wish they had curbside pickup or specific pickup parking like a lot of other chain restaurants provide to convenience customers.
Who isn't a fan of yummy ice cream?! Ghirardelli's is great in San Francisco and it's also great in Las Vegas! If you need a sweet fix head over there, they will definitely make sure to give you your sugar fix!
What awful customer service. I am so disappointed by my experience. I called Gigi's Cupcakes at 3:00 pm today to see if they had mini cupcakes. My girlfriends were getting together for a Girls Night and I thought that cupcakes would be a great addition.  The employee that picked up the phone, Lindsey, had a less than enthusiastic tone. She couldn't have sounded more apathetic. I asked her about the mini dozen cupcakes and she said that they had them for pick up. I told her that I would be headed in. I was clear across town and I made my way down to South Park to Gigi's. I walked in at 4:00pm and there were two teenage employees behind the counter. I informed them that I had talked to Lindsey and I was there to pick up the dozen mini cupcakes. They tried to find them and asked if I had reserved them. I told them about my conversation with Lindsey and they told me that she was in the restroom and that I would have to wait for her. She came out a while later and seemed confused. She asked if she had taken my name. She hadn't. She then told me that they were sold out of the mini dozens. Wait... what... She told me that there were four when I called but they had all sold. Seriously... WTF. Why didn't she tell me that when I called. No offer to hold a dozen. Nothing. They best she could offer me as a solution was 15% off a dozen full size cupcakes ($3.25 each or $3.00 each if buying a dozen). Whoop dee doo... a dozen minis is $15... A dozen full size, even with the discount, would have been more than double that amount. I drove all the way across town to leave empty handed. What a waste of time and gas.

All three employees were so incredibly apathetic and couldn't care less about being there. The customer service was simply awful. I will never return and I cannot recommend that anyone visit this location. There are so many small, local, independent bakeries that have a great product and exceptional customer service.
Um.  I love this joint.  Seriously.  It's the vegetarian burrito for me with black beans, obv, with lots of that hot salsa!  Mmmmm!  If I eat the whole thing I'm full for a good 8 hours....and my burrito is always so tasty, that yep, I'm full for a good 8 hours.  I wish I had the self control to save half for later.  

I'd give this 5 stars, but I'm kind of a health nut and we all know those white toritillas are def not healthy!
My favorite one in the city. They always get my coffee right (it's just hot\/iced blueberry with cream, no sugar) which doesn't seem complicated but the DD on 51 always screws it up, as do Oakland and Squirrel Hill. I only docked this one a star because they never put enough chocolate icing on their donuts. The drive-thru folks are always friendly, too!
While visiting from out of town, my sisters took me here for my birthday dinner. I had the BBQ Salad (vegetarian - make sure you tell them vegetarian or you'll get chicken). It was delicious! When my sister told our server that it was my birthday, she said they would bring out a Red Velvet cupcake after my meal. She did, with a lit candle. Nice touch. Thanks!
This place is indeed a hidden gem. The little back room is like the cosiest little euro-tea room imaginable.
Dined in for lunch with a friend.  There's very limited seating but I managed to grab one of the booths thanks to fortunate timing (and a nice employee asked me if she could wipe it down too).  Limited parking too, but again I had good timing and someone backed out as I pulled in.  There was a pretty good sized group in line ahead of us (five people or so), but the cashier was competent.  The food was delivered pretty fast as well, and I appreciated how many people they had working behind the counter.

Standard burger: The two thinner patties together provided a lot of meat!  The taste was similar to In-n-Out or a meatier, firmer Sonic.  It was okay, but I don't love well-done beef.  Bun was fine, cheese seemed like standard American.

Fries: My generous buddy gave me some of his order of these.  They had a really great herb mix (very similar to Smash Burger's fries) sprinkled on top.  The fries themselves again reminded me of In-N-Out in their shape and texture.  I don't care for how small and greasy they are, and they only taste good when they are hot.  Not bad though, and the server was nice enough to bring extra ketchup (and a bigger water cup for me, which I was grateful for as theirs are ridiculously tiny).

Salted Caramel Shake: Amazing.  This was SO good!  I loved how salty it was.  It had generous ribbons of caramel that I scraped off the side of the cup with my straw afterwards.  It was just the right size, and I appreciated the extra wide, extra strong straw that could handle the thick shake.

Their pricing is very affordable at a solid fast-casual level (more than Sonic, WAY less than Ingo's and Zinburger).  Their pricing is actually HALF of what Zinburger charges for their more basic burgers!  With that in mind, I appreciate this place for what it is: A cheaper alternative to the "fancy burger" places, and a solid "better burger" restaurant.
Long line ups for Sunday brunch - but so worth it!

The baked French Toast is amazing!! Very big portion though!

The butter tart was definitely the best butter tart I've ever had.

Note: it is a very small cafe, not good for large groups.
This is my second year living at Amalfi. I've never had any issues with anyone in the office or the maintenance staff, like the reviewers mentioned below. Actually, everyone is super nice in the office whenever I go turn in rent or pick up packages. Whenever I put in a work request, it's usually done within a day or two, and whenever I see the maintenance staff around, they are super friendly. 

Although the rent has gotten a bit high and I know it's not the best apartment complex, I do think this is a safe and comfortable community to live in. It's good enough that this is the first time I haven't moved after a year for the past 8 years!
I have assisted a number of Jennifer's buyers & sellers over the last several years with their mortgage financing. I have always found that her clients come to me well informed and prepared by her which makes the process a very positive experience for all.

I love working with Jennifer because she is a communicator and acts in her clients best interest. I am well aware that any part of a transaction (escrow, listing\/buying agent, lender etc) can "spoil" a clients experience so when I find a caring professional I am happy to let everyone know!
Came to Glutton on a whim, didn't have any expectations. We were completely blown away by the fantastic food, attentive and friendly staff, and bartender totally on point. I can't say enough good about this place, just blown away! I highly recommend!! Mike was so awesome!!
I do not find the layout or seating of Voluto to be very comfortable, and maybe its ambiance and customer base are just a tad bit too serious for me. Yeah, it feels like an office; a pretty cool office that is employed by nice, modern, apple using, yet innovative, doing-more-than-just-Facebook, like maybe even Tumblr or Cliodynamics, people. But I find monumental comfort in knowing that I can walk in here any day and get an absolutely perfect soy cappuccino. The best. Seriously.
Friday night date dinner on the way to our friends birthday party within a mile of this new spot- The Beverly.

We stopped in around 8:30pm and parked right out front, the dark awnings with thin writing made this bar slightly difficult to find.

We realized it was a seat yourself kind of place- which we did.  They had a range of high top tables, booths, and bar seating.

I opted for a piña colada which was delicious and strong!!  We ordered a Brussels sprout salad & margherita flatbread.  Both food options exceeded our expectations! 

This is more of a bar with food- not as much of a restaurant which is fine with me.

They had a dj playing a mix of top 40 & classic party starters- would have liked a more hip music mix to match the ambience & elevated drink menu.  This is not Applebee's!

Overall would return with a group of people or another date night drink spot!
John was great to work with. He was punctual, informative, and very personable. Would definitely use him again. He and his crew did a great job!
Love love love! The sea bass is incredible, so is the grilled shrimp & eggplant. Their thai basil is a staple for take out. One of my favorite Thai restaurants in the city.
Didn't go into the bar area so this review is only for the dining room.

Pretty small dining room area but they packed in as many chairs\/tables as possible. You order and pick up at the same counter so customer service is really negligible. It seems like a larger scale chipotle.
Since you aren't reserving tables you can fit in a larger group (as long as you grab the seats as they become available). You can also stay as long as you want since you don't have to worry about a waiter rushing you to leave. Also each person can walk up to the counter and order their food so there is no mess with splitting the bill. 

Their turkey burger with the cilantro mess on top was awesome. BF had the steak sandwich and he loved it. Everyone else in the party seemed to be happy with their food as well. 


Downside--wait was FOREVER!! And the chairs were just plain wood. Ouch. 

Although we had a pleasant experience...I'm not dying to go back again.
Carne asada in a marinaded bag, throw it on the grill and cut it into small pieces. Add it to tortillas with some salsa and guacamole that they also sell. BAM! Delicious BBQ meal for friends and family. 

This place is cool and you definitely feel like you're in Mexico. If you're adventurous and want to practice your Spanish you should go and check them out. Cute little market and they have all the essentials for a perfect Mexican night!
I'm usually all for press box on Thursday nights. It's a cool atmosphere and cheap cover and cheaper drinks. Usually pretty crowded with lots of people to mingle with. DJ is always on point and able to get everyone Dancing. If you go to the bar, Daraies and the cute, short dark headed girl are ALWAYS on point. There is one bartender i would steer clear of. Seems to have an attitude and acts like he hates his job. Good place to watch games!!! Oh, did I mention they have a pool hall?! Definitely a place to check out.
We enjoyed an awesome Valentines dinner here!  Had reservations for 8pm, showed up about a half hour early and were taken right to a booth as requested.  Amina was our server for the evening, and she was great!  Very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.  I ordered the Perfect Patron Margarita, it was average for my liking but I certainly didn't let it go to waste.  For the appetizer we tried the Jalapeno Pretzel Sticks with the jalapeno spinach cheese dip.  The pretzel sticks were huge!  The cheese dip was like a spinach queso blanco.  Anima highly recommended the Brew House Chicken, grilled chicken served over white cheddar mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies.  The grilled chicken and potatoes had a brown mushroom gravy on it...YUM!  Veggies were also cooked perfectly!  Hubby had the 11oz sirloin medium rare, and that's how he got it, with mashed potatoes and lemon rice.  Overall great service & great food, two thumbs up!
Finally found my favorite fresh seafood spot in the valley! Wow. What a hidden gem. So glad I found out about this place from a friend after seeing her amazing looking food pics on Snapchat! 

My husband and I came for lunch on a Saturday and it turned out it was "National Oyster Day!" Luckily there was no wait and we were greeted right away. Our service was wonderful throughout the dining experience and everyone we encountered was super friendly and efficient. Ambience was really upbeat, laid back, and an open bar feel. We noticed they were setting up outdoor seating with another bar area, which I'm sure gets pretty busy and looks great in the evening. 

Now to the food - it was superb! We tried the salt and pepper calamari with the Thai dipping sauce -- omg so good - may have been the best I've ever had! The sauce with peppers gave it a nice kick and was so flavorful. Definitely getting that again! We also ordered a few sushi rolls which were incredibly fresh and loved the unique combinations offered. I believe one had macadamia nuts inside and another had almonds. Those flavors merged well with the fresh shrimp, crab and other delicious  fillings. Feeling daring, my husband tried the raw oysters and surprisingly really liked them. The cocktail sauce, horseradish and other tangy sauce they were served with really enhanced the oyster flavor. Since we were filling up, we decided to split the crab cake blt and it was also excellent. 

Next time I'm saving room for dessert. The couple next to us ordered some sort of merengue pie and it was HUGE. Being the nosy girl I am, I had to lean over and ask how it was -- they said it was to die for! I overheard the manager telling them the flourless chocolate cake is also her favorite and is served with an amazing flavorful gelato. 

Yum yum yum. Can't wait to return and show this place off to our friends visiting from out of town!
Great place to eat - the owner came right up to our table. He introduced him self and gave us a spoon fu ll of black bean pasta to try. Love the personal service!
Great burgers for a chain, faster food type of place.  They are made fresh to order and you can taste the difference.  They are served in a little paper wrapper and you should keep it in there, I took mine out and took a bite....well it is fresh so needless to say I got a couple of drops of grease on my shirt.  The fries were nice and crisp bit I think I prefer them plain better than with cheese as the cheese did make them a little soggy.  Prices are reasonable, for my single bacon cheeseburger, my husbands double, cheese fries and a water it was just over $20.
Super simple place but amazing nonetheless. It's been around since the 30's and they still serve the same thing they started with: a bologna and salami sandwich with mustard. 

Staff was very helpful and friendly.
Super fancy one. Very bright. The sell booze. They had Ink when I had a structured sellement and needed it now.
Home Depot selected these guys to install two toilets for me. After some back and forth on scheduling, the day of install, our guy shows up at 7p. That was OK with us so he went straight to work. Guy was done in less than an hour and took the toilets and boxes away with him, which he did not have to do. We did pay for the toilet removal, but did not expect him to take the boxes.  Very nice of him.

The trouble was with the communication with Home Depot and Delta. We called Home Depot 3 times and the folks there were trying to help, but never told us Delta would be doing the install. If they simply had hooked us up with the installer, it really would have helped the scheduling.

Other than that the installer was knowledgeable and efficient.
I have been meaning to try this place for so long. I have heard a lot of good things about BabyStacks (especially that they have Filipino\/Hawaiian dish for breakfast) but they are always busy. The few times I tried going, the wait was over an hour. 

So Saturday morning, I woke up at 7am and made my way to an awesome breakfast. If there is something worth waking up to early on a Saturday morning, it's BabyStacks. 

Let me just say, they have the best red velvet pancake I have ever had. I am not super sold on Red Velvet altogether but I fell in love with their pancakes. It was moist and delicious. It was just pure perfection. I also ordered the famous Lolo Rick's Adobo fried rice with a side of Portuguese sausages. It was good but I thought the adobo would taste like the adobo I used to eat growing up. I guess I set myself up for my own disappointment. I still liked it and I think it is worth the try. 

I would definitely be coming back to BabyStacks. I might even give the place right next to them a try if the next time they are packed. I saw that they the offer traditional Filipino breakfast, so excited for that. I can't wait to come back!
Very, very slow service. Inadequate staffing for the volume of customers and nobody seems in a hurry to help. Find another rental car service at Charlotte airport.
Real Talk: dropping your kid off a daycare for the first time is a tsunami of emotions. When a parent decides on a school whose staff spends more waking hours with your child than you do, things get realllll. In my daycare search, I found our decision making process to be based on logistics but more so, on a mama bear's instinct. 

When I reached out to April, the school director, and asked for a tour, I wasn't really sure what to expect. Guys and gals, I'm here to tell you that if you have a little one, your child will be so loved and so well cared for at MVCP. 

Our LO attended the 1's class (12-24 months) for 7 months and we only left because of an out-of-state relocation. Marie was the lead teacher, aided by the amazingly wonderful Lauren, Carly, and Leslie. I can't say enough wonderful things about this band of gals. Our babe cemented a great relationship with them early in her tenure there. She's pretty choosy about who she lets in to that toddler heart. Marie and gang felt like an extension of family and for that, I am so grateful for our time at MVCP.

Do yourself a favor -- take a tour and hop on the waitlist as soon as you can.
We worked with them while purchasing our new house and they were one of the companies we could use to do our flooring and cabinets. 

First important thing, they only take appointments and no walk ins! Make sure you called ahead of time and schedule an appointment. They usually reserve a period of two hours for you so you can explore everything and have some assisting you and giving you their full undivided attention.

They have a good selection as far as flooring goes and their prices are pretty good. As for the carpet, cabinets and countertops, I wasn't impressed but they do have a decent selection, a little small. 

If you have a two story house (+) I strongly recommend you to add their protection padding if you have pets or kids, it will protect all the wood under the carpet and won't let odors impregnate your house. It does work!

My only complaint about this company is regarding their costumer service and installation. They won't return calls, no matter how many messages you leave; they won't talk to you about sealing your grout (which a lot of new homeowners know nothing about) and when it was time to install the cabinets they messed up in one of our doors so now we will have to have them come out and fix it. Other than that, they're affordable and ok to work with.
We rode our bikes here all to work of the calories from splitting 3 doughnuts.  I choose the old fashioned sour cream donut, lemon filled Bismarck, and we asked for "the best" one and she quickly choose the cinnamon crumb because "her son loves it".

We sat and shared these yummy gems that were not overly sweet yet fluffy and delicious.

The Lemon Bismarck is huge and the filling plentiful and creamy yellow.

The sour cream doughnut was my favorite because of the dense moist but crispy texture.

The crumb was probably the best one- we loved the phoenix suns sprinkles.

Will be back asap!!!!
I was in town from Connecticut which is my current address.  Now, I've eaten in my fair share of upscale Manhattan restaurants.  As a Vegetarian I am pretty particular about my food choices and have no problem dropping serious coin for fresh, delicious food.  I was shopping in the area and decided to drop in and have a relaxing lunch.  I was impressed by the space and the vibe of the place so looked forward to a memorable meal.  Upon entering the space I was asked if I was waiting for someone to join me.  I said I would be dining alone.  I was shown a lovely table in the middle of the room and given a menu. I proceeded to wait and .............wait.  I watched as others  who were seated after me had their orders taken and were served.  I was completely ignored by every single member of the wait staff.   After 25 minutes I got up and asked a server who my server was as I would be writing a review and wanted to mention him or her by name.  At that point I was asked if I was waiting for someone. I left to go spend my money elsewhere.  I will not be returning any time soon.
I don't care much for their menu, but the carne asada (steak) quesadilla I ended up ordering was HUGE and very tasty!  The waitress was attentive.  The leftovers were great.  Oh, and parking here was surprisingly
easy in their lot (no need to go to the overflow across the street).

However, I will never go back here as the music was turned up to a deafening level and was blasting some type of screaming-as-lyrics type noise "music" that was painful.  The restaurant was also packed, so people were yelling OVER the yelling "music" which made me want to just leave, which I would have if I wasn't with my mother (who thankfully is getting a little hard of hearing and so was saved from some
of the horrendous experience).  I feel a weekend lunch is supposed to be a relaxing affair, and not feel like a night club!  If this was management-approved music, and not some employee's iPod plugged in to the sound system, I disagree with their "mood\/environment" choice and will just have to stick with Federal Pizza next door.
This restaurant has been our go to place when we want to eat out but still remain under our daily allowed calorie intake. With the healthy side available, we were still able to enjoy the taste of the happy side with just better, healthier alternatives.

It's kind of a hit or miss here in this restaurant. One time I ordered the chicken and waffle and the chicken was so dry it turned me off to the whole dish. I tried it again the next time just to see if there would be a difference and it was cooked better than it was the first time. 

Everything I've tried on their menu so far, either on the happy or healthy side, has been satisfying and rarely ever disappointing. 4 star for the overall concept of the restaurant.
My new bff Ashley helped me out by refilling my propane tanks.

She saw me park near the area and came right over with the key... complimenting my necklace, relating about man problems, admiring a BMW, we are two peas in a pod.  Not only that, she lifted the full tanks into my trunk.  Muscles!

I saw the 1 star reviews and realized I had to recognize the friendly customer service from Ashley.  Thank you!
The Ritz is known.. well for being the Ritz. The name pretty much says it all, superstar service, creature comforts, all that one could ask for when traveling. From the moment you check in you will be known,  you will be greeted and it feels like they really do want to remember your name.  Service for me was exceptional, Jim gave me a tour of my rooms amenities as well as the hotels, Court took great care of the cars we had in Valet, and In-Room dining food was delicious. Especially, when my party and I were able to order dinner & drinks 14 floors up, from the Aqua Lounge Menu. After doing some laps in the pool we felt we deserved it. I hope everyone at the Ritz-Carlton knows how much I enjoyed my stay. 
**I never did get to ask if they do some kind of aromatherapy in the rooms but I swear, every time I picked up the phone in my room I smelled fresh cut cedar**
Came here for a Christmas lunch not expecting much after reading for reviews.  I was surprise by the atmosphere in the restaurant, it looks way better inside than it does outside.  The service was good overall, not much to complain.

Now for the food, I order the reuben sandwich with fries.  There was a generous portion of smoked meat in the sandwich, however the bottom of the bread was soggy.  It might have been because of the large party that we had and they waited to take all our meals out at once.  Overall, the food is mediocre and the prices were average, but the décor is fairly nice.  I wouldn't come back for seconds, but if you're in the area and just want a place to chill and have drinks it might be worth coming since they have lots of TV's and a pool table for you to pass time.
Never disappointed when I come here.  Excellent pizza with the freshest ingredients.  Highly recommend the garlic knots!  Food is always ready when quoted for take out.  Service is great, very friendly and helpful staff!
Very nice  bar with  fun design . It's very amazing  . There are very good cocktail with original name .
Yep, still sucks.  Had to stay here for work, not by choice.

The beds are stiff and generally uncomfortable.  The heating\/cooling unit turns on often at any temperature.  It is best to shut it off to sleep since it is extremely noisy.  The television is older than me.

The casino area reeks of smoke.  They need to invest in some higher volume air cleaners.  Just walking to the elevators will require you to burn your clothes to get the odor off.

There are no decent food options.

Lastly, they were hosting a cheerleading competition for young kids.  Two things; what casino would host this type of event, what organization representing children would choose a casino?  As a casino you annoy and disturb all your other visitors.  Nothing says family like gambling, booze and smoke.  Great parenting.
The correct names for this airport:

En Anglais:     Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport
En Francais:  Aéroport international Pierre-Elliott-Trudeau de Montréal

But for short, it is Montreal-Trudeau.
The airport code is YUL.
(All Canadian airports have a IATA code that starts with Y, and don't ask me, I don't know Y)

The airport is named after the popular and charismatic former Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Trudeau, a dashing, movie star-like leader who captivated Canada with his style, panache and gallavanting. 

The airport itself is well organized, spacious, and has a good representation of side distractions for food and shopping. Esthetically, it is pleasing as well. Getting in and out, is another story. For a major metropolis airport, it is lacking in easy motor access; it has small highways and roads that lead in and out of it.

Be prepared as a foreign (yes, US is foreign) visitor to get questioned in immigration about why you are there, how long you are staying, where are you staying, and what is your purpose of your visit. If it is for business, did you declare everything, are you bringing in samples or merchandise, actually, the usual customs questions you will get at most international airports. Nothing more than a foreigner would get coming to the US. (well, depending on how you look and act, maybe less!)

The rental cars are across from the terminal in the parking garage, so no shuttle to negotiate. All the signs are bi-lingual, French and English, so even though you are in proud and often separatist Quebec, you are accomodated fairly. (The farther northeast you go in Quebec, the less English is spoken or tolerated!)

Customs are spacious and well organized, incoming or out-going. As always, reserve a little extra time for this processing, however. 

There are public transporation options, with bus services and shuttles and regional shutles, and if you take a mini-bus 2 KM, you can access VIA Rail Canada, the main train service that services the main cities in Canada. 

A few years ago, there was a big push to replace Trudeau with Dorval, an airport to the North of Montreal. They starting moving flights there, but once again, without a new highway to easily access Dorval, the airport eventually lost all business and shut down. C'est la Vie, pour les Quebecois!

Do you know why Canadians say "Eh?" all the time?

Answer: C-A-N-A-D-A!
This is an absolutely stunning restaurant to eat at! I have been here 3 times now and it is still by far the best place I have ever eaten. It has a great modern-age atmosphere with even better food! Located right on top of the Overture Center in downtown Madison, you can pretty much see Madison in all its glory! Their food is amazing and made-to-order, even the smallest of details. Also, the bread they bring out is simply the best in the world (to me at least haha) it is perfectly warm and buttery and easily comes apart with a slight tug. Wonderful place to eat and a great romantic dining experience. If you haven't been here before. GO
I can't say I hate this place but I can't say I love this place. So Menards right away is probably known for having everything under the stars for home improvement and other related products. This location is a little hard to get to but not impossible and is in a relatively good area to strive. As expected they have almost everything I have ever looked for in stock and at a competitive price. Its clean, products are generally clearly marked and are pretty easy to find. Now the reason I gave it a 3 Star review is their staff. Which I feel I should give another chance after reading other review but I'll provide my opinion.

The staff, at least every time I have been here are extremely unhelpful. Not once have I ever been given a for sure "Yes we have that" or "Well let me check"  while I have been searching. They are few and far between and I have been "suggested" to look in an area across the store but never taken to an area, said to ask anyone else, or had someone look for something for me. They just use their radios to ask someone who in response just says "just have them (the customer) look in ' such and such an isle'". I haven't been back here for a couple months now due to my experiences but I may return for my next purchase to try and get a better experience. But we will see.
I was in an in-service in this area today. When lunch time rolled around my colleagues all started exclaiming about Johnny's. I had never been and they were anxious for me to try it out.

When we drove up to it I recognized it from driving by, but had never been in. The lineup encouraged me that I was at a good place.

Service was fast and friendly. I got a cheeseburger and onion rings. They gave me a number and when I was called up, I chose what to put on my burger. 

Now, let's get down to the nitty gritty.

First of all, the toppings are VERY limited. Onions or sautéed onions, pickles, tomato, ketchup, mayo, mustard, relish...I didn't even see lettuce, unless it was hiding in the back. 

The burger was large, but nothing special. It wasn't like some fantastic, juicy, seasoned meat or anything. Just a basic burger. 

The bun was too soft and got soggy really fast. I mean SOGGY! It had a weird sweetness to it that I wasn't a huge fan of. The onion rings were your basic frozen onion rings...same with the fries. They weren't hand-battered, or homemade...just standard fare. 

Honestly, NOTHING about this place warranted the rave reviews from my colleagues and the only thing I could glean from hearing them talk, was that this place has been around Scarborough forever and it's just a staple. You go here based on tradition. 

Well, sadly that's not enough of a reason for me to give this a good review. It's also not enough of a reason for me to bother recommending this place. Unless this place has some near and dear meaning in your heart, Hero Burger makes a WAY better burger. I guess if you want your burger made with "love and memories" come to this place. I want my burger made with juicy meat, lots of veggies and some sort of mayo-based sauce! If you cannot deliver, I am not interested. Johnny's did not deliver for me on this one!

(PS- If you are the type of person who reads reviews, you'll see one of two camps here...people who love this place based on landmark status and people who haven't been coming here since they were young and therefore are not big fans. Basically THIS "PS" could be the review!)
It pains me to write this because I have never had a bad experience at a Port of Subs. However, this store became the exception to my rule this week. I went at lunch time so it was understandably busy but I wasn't greeted or acknowledged until I was served. I order the vegetarian sandwich. This is where my visit went downhill. This particular location only has one meat\/cheese cutter--which means that the meat AND the cheese are sliced on the same machine--which means that even their "vegetarian sandwich" is going to have meat goo on it. BUMMER. This is a deal breaker for me but because I had already waited so long to be served I didn't have time to go anywhere else to get food. As I was checking out, I was charged for the avocado I asked for on my sandwich even though it states on the menu that it is included. The less-than-helpful cashier argued with me about it and at the end, I still ended up getting charged. Absolutely, positively will not be returning to this location.
I bought a groupon voucher for Double Wings Art.  When I tried to use it, they did not recognize it and told me to go back to Groupon.  This is not a customer friendly place and as of now, I think I may have been scammed.
I ate here with a friend, and I plan to come back again because there are so many items on the menu that I want to try.  I had the tomato basil pasta, and it was so yummy.  The portion size was good, too, I thought (for the price) - not too much and not too little.  I like the outdoor seating option, too (though we did not take advantage of it).  The District is a beautiful place to be, so if you're in the area, stop by!  The food and the scenery are both very worthwhile.
This is a decent little hotel. I had spent an evening here sometime ago. 

Nothing fancy, but the room was clean and that's what I was looking for at the time.

You've got a little bar right next door so if you're looking for a little night cap you're all set.
If 0 stars would be available that's what I would give.
This place had the worst service ever!
We arrived late night and the place was empty.
Our server took our order and never came back in to check on us. After 45 mins we decided to ask about our meal and they told us it was normal to wait a while. Shortly after our waitress comes to our table and states she doesn't know what happened to our order so she's going to place it again and asks what we're having. She didn't empathize or say she was sorry. We literally stood up. On the way out I saw another employee and asked to speak to their boss and she stated she wasn't sure where the manager was at.
Do not recommend this place if you're looking to feel welcomed and appreciated as a customer.
The food here is a 5 out of 5. Very, very delicious. I got the New York Strip along with the fries. The steak was tender and cooked just right. The ketchup they gave me with my fries was amazing. Had a lil spicy kick to it, I highly recommend it. Got the cheesecake for a dessert. It was one of the best pieces I've had.  Excellent food there. 

The service here though was terrible. Actually, I'll change that to our waiter was terrible. He was trying to be very sneaky and add extra charges to our bill to make it higher. Then when I asked him about these extras charges, he would start talking under his breath so I couldn't understand him, maybe thinking I'd leave the situation alone. I don't believe at all that this is a representation of the other members of the staff here. I think this is just one lone ranger trying to be slick to get an extra few bucks. The higher the bill, the higher the tip usually. It didn't happen for this guy. 

The food here would bring me back when I come back to visit Las Vegas. However, if I see the server we had coming towards our table, I know what I'll be asking for first... A new waiter.
I wish there was the option to give half stars, because if there was I would give Lemon Bistro 3-1\/2. Overall, our experience was fine and I would probably try it again, but I won't be rushing back. We called to make reservations. I asked for 7 or 7:30 and was told that 7:30 "would be better". Assuming that meant 7 was a busy time, we went to the area and were prepared to wander around for a bit...but the restaurant was almost empty, so we went in and were seated promptly. 

Our waitress was very friendly and took our orders. I had the mussels and my husband had the salad. Both were good, although the mussels were quite spicy, something I wish was specified before ordering. 

My husband ordered the pork hock and I had the pasta. His dish was prepared very well and the meat very tender and nice. My pasta however was very bland. the pasta noodles were overcooked and fell apart easily, making it hard to twist in my fork. The limited sauce had little flavour. The chicken and mushrooms in the pasta were the best part, but it wasn't enough to make me consider this a "good" dish. More like something I would make for myself at home and be only mildly satisfied. 

When the server gave us our bill, she took away my husband's beer that he was not finished with. We didn't notice until it was too late. 

All this said, I saw other dishes that looked pretty amazing, my husband's food was much better than mine, and despite the beer stealing, the waitress was very nice. The atmosphere made for a nice date spot. 

It's not cheap though, coming to $77 for the two apps, two drinks and two mains. So I was hoping for a little better. I hope if I try this place again it will please me a little more.
Good tapas  nice !!! Belle chorégraphie  de danse flamenco.  Bon service à la clientèle.
*sniff* I can't believe I was made to cry (on the inside) no less on New Year's Eve. My hubby and I came here thinking we would split a burrito since I know how big the burritos can be at Chipotle.  

We waited in line. I watched the two guys in front of me each get 2 tortillas each for their burrito and the girl behind the line really piled on the rice, beans, and their choice of meat. I was thinking, wow, these burritos are even bigger than what I remembered. 

Then when it came my turn for my burrito, the girl behind the counter took one look at petite me and took out one tortilla and gave me a skimpy serving of rice, beans, and seriously like 5 pieces of meat. I felt so crest fallen.  I looked at the measly portion that was going to be my burrito, I looked at the girl behind the counter and asked why the two guys in front of me got such massive burritos but not me. She just rolled her eyes at me and went on to the next costumer. 

Boy, was I disappointed. And I checked too with those two young guys in case they paid extra for their mega massive burritos. Nope, same price as what I paid. 

I seriously wanted to take a photo of my burrito next to theirs cause mine would look like the runt of the litter. It was so pathetically so much smaller in size. 

I thought maybe it was an off night but from reading the other reviews, many other customers have received the same uneven service. 

Chipotle corporate, you should take note since as corporate you take such pride in providing a good product and service- that is the Chipotle brand and signature. 

Well, this particular location is not making the grade. 

And *sniff* now I know what being an unwanted stepchild feels like. *sniff*.
Delightful date night with a great friend.    Immediately felt welcome and settled in.   Two male staff were kind, attentive and very aware of their environment.    
Drinks and food were timed perfectly felt attended to but un rushed
Must return again soon (please excuse grammatical errors)
The location is INSIDE SPARK (a collection of salon suites) right next to Party City. So if you are mapping for location, map for SPARK. Don't make the same mistake I did not knowing this tip and drove around for at least 20 mins in frustration trying to find the place. 
Once inside SPARK, Sarah who is the owner for Tense Knots and the massage therapist is in suite #109. This part is easy to find as the suite #'s are clearly marked on the door. 
Sarah is very sweet and has a good hand with the massages. My left shoulder and neck were in pain and I felt much better after a session with her. I would go back to her again. 
The suite itself is one room, nicely decorated. Very peaceful feeling. Despite having noisy hair salons on 2 sides of her and across the hall, once the door was closed it was blissfully silent so you don't have to worry or get disturbed by noise. 
She offers first time client specials and a one time 4 massages for $160. Her schedule is quite busy- if you live in the area, check her out, go online and book an appointment with her!!!
Great staff, amazing scents. Knowledgeable. They always have some sort of deal going on. If you live indoors I recommend this place to help your place smell better.
Heavenly pasta that it perfect to get as a take out dinner so you can sit at home and enjoy food that you could only dream of making! Try their Ravioli it's perfection!
I've been an Yelp Elite for 5 years and this has to go down in the books as the worst event I've ever attended. I feel bad for the Yelp Elites whose first experience was this event. I promise you- this is a very atypical experience. 
This review as many of the reviews have written, is not for the volunteer or the food truck vendor- it's for the organization of the festival itself. 
One word description:  dismal. In addition to agreeing to everything Mary S. wrote in her review, I had to add that the restaurants featured in the sample village were staffed with volunteers. I asked several of the booths the name of the restaurant of the food I was sampling & none of them knew!!!!
In addition, the volunteers were doing the cooking at some of them . . . with no prior training or licensing- what?!?!?!
At several of the booths, the volunteers told me they were ready to walk off & go home it was soooo disorganized. 
The only reason I am giving this festival one star is because I need to give it one star to write a review. If possible, I would give this particular festival zero star!
I love this place. Girls working great! They are sweet and professional . Thank you for your job!!!
Four of us went Saturday evening, and I was excited to find several open tables inside and little wait to order.  It's a really neat building with a great story, appealing to my love of things local, natural, and organic.  Although....however natural my grilled cheese and french fries were, I'm sure they weren't healthy!  Definitely delicious with the texas toast, and a chocolate shake to top it off!  The boyfriend enjoyed the BBQ Bacon Blue Burger and garlic fries, although I had to stay away from him after that because those were stroooong!  

I'm not sure it's a good place to go on a date, since yes, there were plenty of kids around and this was just a Saturday evening.  In fact, several were playing in the ditch as we went to leave.  I can only imagine a weekend morning.  Great if you have kids since there's lots of outdoor space to run around in, not so great if you don't want to hear it.  

Overall, a unique and pleasant addition to Gilbert!
I guess when you're a vegan restaurant it's important that people know you're a vegan restaurant.  You know...so the vegans know how to find you.  And...bear with me here...that makes sense.  But Apteka isn't a good vegan restaurant.  Or...perhaps it's more accurate to say instead, Apteka isn't JUST a good VEGAN restaurant.  It's a good restaurant.  Yeah...there's no meat on the menu.  Or...you know...dairy or eggs or fish and stuff. 

So I suppose if you're dining with someone that REQUIRES meat.  Like...like Count Dracula for example.  If you and the Count are dining, this is a bad selection.  But apart from Count Dracula, or other people...like those too hidebound to attempt something with the "Vegan" label...this is a good restaurant.  No additional qualifiers required.

Secondly...I sampled four cocktails from their bar.  All from the menu (before you think, ugh, Jesus, Jim, not another drunk review...one of the drinks was just a taste of my date's drink).  And they were each better than the last.  REALLY well balanced nicely thought out drinks.  Can't really go wrong.  

The pierogies were excellent.  The tartines were superb.  The Boczniaki z kapusta was good, not great...the cabbage was a little clunky to eat.  It resisted my efforts to cut it into mouthful sized pieces.  The flavors were nice though.  We capped our evening with the "special sandwich".  We just saw it pass our table too many times not to give it a try.  It didn't disappoint.

Our server was a menacing looking fellow all betatted and armful with a perpetual scowl.  Which sounds like a bad thing, but if you asked him a question he would just light up like a kid at christmas and tell you ALL THE THINGS, beaming and gushing and very knowledgable and the contrast was so friggin' delightful that I kept asking him stuff to watch him transform over and over from menacing to kid-at-christmas and back again.

Probably the biggest criticism I have to the place is that it's lit in a way that is not conducive to artful pictures.  You know we MUST have pictures of our food.  And no matter which way we positioned glasses or seats or plates...there was always some weird shadow.  

Work on it, Apteka.  The people must post.

Anyway...I'll be back.  Meat or no meat.
I ordered the Stuffed Pork Chop.. and it was great. I ordered through postmates, so I can't really speak about the vibe or service. But the stuffed pork chop was great.  Will definitely try again.
I just witnessed a very unprofessional manager loudly berating his employees right in front of customers.  I was embarrassed for them....it was very uncomfortable!! He was definitely someone that should not be s manager.  He was very negative and threatening them with write ups for not selling enough bottled water.  The staff is amazing and a very upbeat nice restaurant.  But this manager has got some kind of power trip going and needs to be educated in professional management of his staff.
Clean cafe with a live plant wall. Good place to hang and study, reliable wifi. They have charcoal waffle that actually taste charcoal-y!
This review is being occasionally brought to you by Showcase Mazda service lobby wifi. Kinda. Because it took 20 minutes for it to work. But we seem to be okay now. Hopefully I can get through this.

Now that I have that off my chest I have to say I'm confused. Why? Because, according to yelp, the Mazda dealership near 16th St & Camelback brands its service department under a completely different name. But I have never experience that in my contact with them or mailings I receive. It's always been Camelback Mazda. Alas, I am getting service, so I guess this is the company I need to file it under.

After being here a few times, I have to say it's pretty much so-so. The first time I was here, I had an amazing experience with the service department. Iain was fantastic and told me what was up and showed me what was going on. I hate when mechanics and service staff just assume I'm gonna throw money at them without understanding the issue. It's crazy. He also gave me a loaner car when it was going to be longer than expected, which I truly appreciate. Granted it was a horrid orange Subaru wagon\/SUV thing that was SO not my Mazda, but it worked.

This time, I'm a little less optimistic. The time it took me to even get my car into service was a nightmare. I sat there while some typing was going on and questions were asked that should've been in my record and on my appointment (like WTF I'm getting done). Other Mazda dealerships I've been to have had that ready when I got there. I just review sign, and go hop to my coworking. The end. Get with it. It took 15 minutes for my car to even get back there. Maybe I should get here 20 minutes early next time. 

However, the lobby if you need to wait is fantastic. I always choose to sit and wait because it gives me time to catch up on things, like yelp reviews. There's a TV, some couches, high tables to sit and work at, wifi, popcorn, coffee, soda, and slushies. Oh and this great photo wall of people kayaking. I uploaded it so you don't miss out.

Overall not too bad, but time will tell how consistent the check-in procedure is.
Heed everyone's warning: The service here is TERRIBLE. But you get what you pay for, right? For $16\/person + tax and tip, this is one of the cheaper places to go to if you want AYCE KBBQ. 

I have been to Korean Garden a couple of times with my friends. My experiences with them were pretty pleasant so I decided to take my family here. Worst decision ever. 

Given the fact that the service here is already terrible, the staffs are not one bit nice about it at all. Here's what really ticked me off:

 1) They bring the meat to the table but they take forever to come back to put it on the grill. (Trust me, I would love to do the cooking myself but I got called out before for touching the tongs\/scissors). They need an excuse for that gratuity.

2) They automatically get gratuity because it's their house rule. I get it that they cook the food\/cut the meats on the grill but most of the time they are not around to do it anyway. They probably know that if they leave it to the customers to tip they would get 0 tip because of how bad their service is. 

3) The time limit of 1 hour and 30 minutes is not enough because I spent 45+ minutes of that time, waiting. I was not able to enjoy my meal because they were so slow that I practically just waited all that time. Waiting for the meat, waiting for the drinks, waiting for the bill, etc. 

I probably would not be back anymore. I would rather shell out a few more dollars in a nicer spot where they actually care for their customers rather than be given mediocre food and bad service. My suggestion would be, go here off peak hours - maybe the service would be better.
Great brunch. I had eggs benedict with Halloumi and spinach which was really tasty. Eggs were slightly overdone but still enjoyable. Berry smoothie was super fresh and the coffee was lovely and smooth.
Came in today to order balloons for my sons party. Jazmine and Izzy were so helpful, not to mention super sweet. Costumer service was awesome.
It's sad that I have to leave an upgraded review for this place and knock it down three stars. Just to start, this has nothing to do with the food. I still recommend getting the homefries if you go here, but I knocked the stars because of the service. 
Upon arrival at 1:22pm (closes at 2, so I figured it wouldn't be a big deal) I felt unwelcomed by the hostess who was hesitant to seat me. I got over it and was happy to be seated but felt rushed to order. After my food came out she asked if I wanted anything and I asked for ketchup, after waiting 5 minutes she still never brought it out so I just ate without it. 
While I was eating, they were closing down the shop, wiping and spraying all of the tables (around 1:40pm), and organizing the silverware for the next day at the table across from me. The only thing I wanted to do was leave! The waitress was nice to me, but she and the others were extremely inconsiderate of the guests in the restaurant (2 other couples). I will never return here just because of this experience. If you close at 2, that's when you start wiping down tables and stop seating people.
This is what dining in AZ should be- I like seeing green chilies on several menu items!!

Finally a non- chain restaurant with inspired dishes beyond what you typically find in this neighborhood. My mom and I tried this spot in the mall behind Sonic and by Starbucks after a slow greeting at another nearby go-to.

Unfortunately we arrive for breakfast at 11:02 and the kitchen was "switched over" for lunch.

I opt for coffee & carrot cake... This is my dream breakfast as the coffee is hot and tasty and carrot cake not overly sweet.  This carrot cake has pistachios instead of walnuts and the highlight of this 3 layer masterpiece is the rich vanilla bean cream cheese frosting.

My mom gets a burger & fries which is charbroiled nicely though the patty was previously frozen and not fresh ground.  The brioche bun is a nice touch and the fries are hot & seasoned well.

Our server Lisa was professional, efficient, and accurate.  When she checked on how we liked our food (we said it was great!) she got a big smile on her face since we started as a tough crowd wanting breakfast.
Service: 5 stars. Food: 5 stars. Location: 5 stars. 

Our server Sean was very attentive, he was very polite and patient as we chit chat while looking through all the delicious sounding items on the menu.

We split a spinach artichoke dip, it was on point. 

The lobster roll was flavorful and plentiful. 

We were debating whether to sit outside to enjoy the view or inside, the person who seated us picked a table by the window on the inside so we got a little of both, AC plus a view of the Eiffel tower ;)
Great Establishment! Professional Front Office Staff, Assistant and Dr. Ibrahaim was very good about explaining everything step by step. Good Dental Experience
Yesterday was my first time here and it was delicious. I did a to go dinner ordered one roll called dragon and staff are very nice. CAME back the next day with my friend chez everything was good same thing everything was awesome.
This place umm alright, two server either on their phone or laptop .. didnt really care much .. the food taste weird.
Ehhhhh, It was a lot of hype. Place was packed, 45 minute wait for a table of 2. We walked over to the bar instead and had a couple of beers. Good thing we didnt invest much more as the beers were just ok, nothing special in my opinion. We tried a few other samples just to make sure and we were sure :(

Kinda disappointed but oh well, cant win em all.
Best
Pedicure
I've Ever Had,
In My Entire Life.

In the shopping center next to Smith's Foods and f.y.i. the check-in special is expired
Frozen drink while I wait, kind staff, new feet!
Incredible experience!!!
I like this place.  When I was looking to move to Mt. Washington, I certainly did my research on coffee shops because I wanted one within walking distance.  Shiloh Street is interesting to me because I like the mix of Grandview tourists and residents.

My first stop at the coffee shop was nice.  The owner is approachable and courteous.  The coffee is good which is important.  Not certain which roaster they use, but they have good hours and open at 7:00 AM.  There is seating outside.

My only complaint is the lack of a website.  I wouldn't even mind just a basic website with a menu updated seasonally to reflect any drink specials.  This seems to be a common thread with some of the businesses along Shiloh Street which is one of the core business areas in Mt. Washington.  Perhaps I will offer my pro-bono help with it?
Had a solid salmon bowl here. Good chicken skewers. Cool atmosphere downtown. Probably not bad for drinks either. Will build my own ramen next time.
They have an additional location in Robinson Township, PA.  This is the only place I would ever get my hair done.  It is inexpensive because you are being styled by students.  No fear though!  The instructors are helping out every step of the way.  I have gotten my hair cut, dyed, and permed here.  They are fabulous.
Solid, cheap, delicious Italian.  Good calzones, baked spaghetti, and Alfredo (don't forget to add chicken).  Excellent for takeout as well.
Green's has some delicious hot dogs. No frills, served on a styrofoam plate, with old school fries. Old school as in that's the same fries they served at my old high school. Order at the counter, pick up at the counter. Their lunch is delicious. That's what gets them the second star.

Breakfast, however, is a mess. Again, order at the counter, grab a seat, and wait about 30 minutes for an omelet. The coffee is drinkable. The biscuits are delicious (but not available on weekends). The grits are...probably instant grits. Were it not for the convenient location, I probably wouldn't go to Green's at all.
They put together their own tea bags based on what you order...that is straight up amaze balls. Also they are open crazy late so we walked in after going  for a stroll after going out for dinner! Loved having some digestive soothing trifecta tea after dinner! 

PLENTY of seating space! Check out the upstairs level while you're there!
Yes it's pricey but it's so worth it! I just came back from the lunch here and I think I paid about $40\/person and the tip. I've been to approx 5 different churrascaria restaurants in 3 different cities, but this is by far the best. I love everything here, especially lamb, garlic sirloin, fish (salmon), fried banana, risotto, and caramel flan. This place does train their service stuff well. You may feel that someone is always watching you when you eat, but as soon as you finish eating, drop a fork, or empty the water glass, someone always come right away to accommodate your need. I asked the server if he's got any lamb, and even though there was only 4 of us in the restaurants that time, he went back to the kitchen and prepare one just for us. Managers are also very friendly. Ambience here is sophisticated... subtle Brazilian music, spacious floor plans, contemporary objects, perfect for someone's birthday party or dinner date. I'd love to come back soon, but first I have to digest the food first.
The Venetian is an awesome and beautiful place!!!! The Gondola Ride is so much fun too, and you feel like your in Venice!!!!! Great, fun, and a extremely enjoyable resort hotel!!!!!!!
I had to get new auto insurance b\/c when I moved last year, I changed States. I have a perfect driving \/ claim (no claims) record of 15 years (knock on wood) and I am 41. I also drive a super safe vehicle that's not a drag racer car. It was also not financed. So I should most definitely get all the discount benefits being so low risk. However, I couldn't believe how ridiculously high all the quotes I got were. And I am in Nevada now? I'm talking about, ALL the quotes I got were double the cost of what I was paying in Cali and at that, these policies were bare minimum coverage. Before I had full coverage and low deductibles (I had Mercury \/ Progressive). And even a new quote from them was exactly the same, double the cost, less than half the coverage. 

Then I found Geico. I'll just leave it at that. I have had them this whole year. And then this month I sold my car and bought a Scooter (for the interim). It's kind of tricky, b\/c these kinds of Scooters don't have VIN #s, aren't registered etc. So after I signed up for this new policy online, I called the Geico office just to clarify these things. The service there was immediate. I had a specialist on the line with me within minutes. And I was covered immediately. Huh, $25 bucks a month on this new policy!! Really friendly, helpful staff. And I feel totally confident in their service. 

Last but not least, I have seen that Geico's offerings as far as discounts (for certain things that make you lower risk) was the best fit for me! Other companies had some of the discounts for me, Geico had all the discounts that I wanted \/ deserved to benefit from (in the overall cost of the policy). 

When I go buy my next car, (assuming nothing changes w\/Geigo and I don't expect it will), I will definitely stay with Geico then too.
Brought my little sisters(in law) to have some fun. We got here early so we were able to get chairs under an umbrella which was great for my husband and I while the girls played. The rides were great. The boards you use for the slides were kind of gross and moldy looking in the crease. They have a food court, drink station and a few dip n dot carts. I was just looking to get something to drink, but my only option was to stand in the 30+ minute food court line because they didn't have any other windows or stations open. Very inconvenient, especially for a Saturday. And you can't bring in your own coolers so you're S.O.L. if you want a quick drink.
This place and its owner\/operators are the best.  Phong and his wife are pleasant, fun, and have great stories.  They have a good selection of import beers and Phong even ordered in something for us that he did not normally stock.  The prices are reasonable and he has all of your convenience needs on top of the great beer and liquor.
The Factory of Cheesecake

Always a good call if your unsure of what your looking for. Cheesecake Factory is one of those places that has one of those huge menus where if you can't find something to eat, clearly your not hungry or having some of interstellar hunger breakdown.

Having been to cheesecake in a few locations around the states this Factory has all the bells and whistles you come to expect from any other franchise.

Ordering the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp and the Chopped salad for our main we dived straight into the massive portion of food. Make sure to always come hungry. They have a small kids menu as well as high chairs for the kiddos!! 

Since the Mains are pretty big my suggestion is try to order the small dishes if your looking for the amazing cheesecake! My favorite cheese cake is the Carrot Cheese cake. Some of the chocolate cheesecake can be pretty amazing as well. Also if your not a Heavy cream person let them know as they like to stack a massive cream side to your cake. 

As for service, expect a line if your coming at peak times, usually 7 days of the week this Cheesecake Factory is busy so don't be surprised when you might have to wait a while.

Overall a great place and can be recommended for almost any occasion
Sure the place is a giant gimmick, but its a fun gimmick and for what it is they do it well enough.  The food is what you would expect from a diner and it really isn't bad at all.  My boyfriend loves the shakes, I can't do much ice cream so I haven't had one.  On certain days of the week they have awesome deals for kid's meals.  One other thing that impressed me about 5 & Diner was found on their website.  First they have all of their nutritional information available, but even more impressive is they have a menu for Gluten free choices as well as Lactose free choices.  Very cool in my opinion.
Did this crazy woman really just review a hearing clinic? Yep.

Is she deaf? Far from it :)

Today I had a hearing test. Not something I think you'd typically see a woman my age writing about, but nevertheless, it is truth. 

The center is tucked away on the side of Papago Plaza that I never go to and for a moment I thought I had mixed up where I was going, but alas I found it next to the Papago Inn.

The place is small and quaint, which is I guess what I would suspect for a hearing clinic. The staff is very friendly and helpful and advised me on the forms I needed to fill out and what would be happening during the testing. They were conversational which put me at ease.

The testing procedure was comfortable and didn't take long at all. I was given the results instantly and congratulated on my impeccable hearing skills.
Came for lunch and it was quite packed. Obviously we will be ordering the Chicken and Waffles. It's big enough for two people. Ordered a small side plate just in case. The chicken tasted really good. However, the chicken breast was a bit chewy. Perhaps that's the portion where it's hard to cook cause of its meat density.  The Smoked briskets were perfect. It was a good size meal, didn't put anyone into a food coma.
Finally a juice spot close by.  Nice interior, set up as if it is a bar- a Juice bar!  You can sit and taste prior deciding on which you will purchase.  While you are there, perhaps enjoy a 'shot' suggested by one of the employees. My favorite juice (at the current moment) is the Nojito.  Make sure you download app card!
I was unable to get a same-day appointment from the vet of my choice when I knew my 18-year old little girl cat's time had come. Their office gave me the number of this clinic and I was told I could drop in. It was my only day off in weeks and no others were in sight so it had to be done. The vet examined her and when I turned down the offer of blood tests and a cardiologist he agreed to euthanize her. He took her away for a first shot and returned her to allow me time to say goodbye. I left the exam room for the counter where my bill was presented. It was for $470. I questioned the amount, having been quoted less than $200 by my clinic of choice. I was told that only the "doctor" could amend the bill and did I wish to speak to him? I did. After ten minutes or so I was directed into an exam room, where I found my cat alert and the "doctor" next to her with a hypodermic needle in his hand. I am absolutely convinced that this was my punishment for questioning the charge - which incidentally included $100 for a five-minute exam ($9600 per eight hour day) and $80 to insert a catheter. He told me, when I raised the quote I had received, that he worked multiple clinics and his charge was pretty standard, and that what I was quoted was clearly only a part of what I would have been charged. I don't wish to invite a law suit so I'll leave the story here.
Oh black beans....how I love thee.  Blue Burrito Grille has a healthier menu, such as those black beans and whole wheat tortillas, which is great.  I've came here to both pick up a meal and sit down and eat.....never having to wait more than 5 minutes for my food.  They have several high top tables, outdoor patio seating, a yummy salsa\/chip bar, and alcohol.  The house margarita is okaaay.  

Bottom line....if I'm feeling "fast" mexican food and a lot of it, I'll head to Chipotle and down a burrito.  When I'm feeling health conscious, I head here.
Baku is unlike anything else in Charlotte.  The food is prepared on Robata and Yakitori grills.  The concept is Japanese-inspired shared plates - presented to the table one at a time so that diners can fully enjoy the flavors of each dish.   We loved being able to try many different dishes, each impeccably prepared and presented beautifully.  Every dish we had was delicious but we especially enjoyed the lamb chops and the pork belly.

The restaurant is gorgeous with gleaming stone walls, textured fiber ceilings, sleek bamboo furniture, vivid art pieces, and perfect lighting.  The upstairs lounge is exquisite!
I have had mostly good experiences at EVO and one that was very disappointing.

On several occasions, we have enjoyed either happy hour or dinner. The food is tasty and I appreciate the vegetarian options. Most of the time, the service is good. The one time exception that I have not been able to push from my memory was for a friend's birthday party. We were a party of 14 and from the beginning, the night was a mess. It took 20 minutes for our server to greet us and take our drink orders (without much of an apology.) I ordered the vegetable risotto which came out 30 minutes after everyone had received their food. I essentially ate by myself and when the house manager came over to make amends, he gave two other people refills on their drinks. It was very strange and while I have not experienced anything like that since, it bumped EVO down on my list.
CASH ONLY. Ok or miss service. You need to drench your pho in oyster sauce before your taste bud can even taste something. Pretty dang average.
Another solid & delicious dinner!

My mom and I are back- we were seeing a show in Tempe so we came in for an early lunch.  Tempe is seriously lacking in decent steakhouses so lucky for Durants.

We came in around 4:10 pm and requested a bar table- unfortunately they were reserved.  We sat in a dining room booth, boring atmosphere at that time of day.  Would seem a tiny bit crowded if it were full.

I was in the mood for a margarita, as usual, and my mom got wine.  It wasn't the best I've had but obviously from fresh lime.  Nice to see our server bring the wine bottle out & pour a sip before committing to the wine. 

The crudités and bread are solid starters and we were bad and got 1\/2 order of onion rings to start. They were nice and hot and crispy- everything we were hoping for!  For salads my mom had the house and I had the wedge which was delicious!  They are generous with toppings and the lettuce is nice and cold.

For entrees we tried a 16 oz T-bone.   It wasordered it medium well though it arrived more medium than she prefers.  Our server came back to check at the perfect time and quickly replaced the steak with a perfect medium well T-bone with new potato.  So many restaurants would bring the same potato or left the potato when they took the steak.  Small things make a difference!

My Kobe sliders were yummy on pretzel buns with Caramelized onions and a horseradish mustard.  If I get them again I would get the mustard on the side.  It was still really yummy but very mustardy.  I had a recommended Cabernet Sauvignon that went great with this & ended up being on the happy hour.  Thank you to our server again for not trying to bring a $16 glass of wine when a comparable one is on happy hour! 

We were way too full for dessert but reminisced about the delicious creamy New York cheesecake.

I get the impression this place really understands customer loyalty and what customers value.  Thank you Durants for another delicious, comfortable, and fun meal for my mom and me!
Hooray for beer. Horray for the microbrew movement. Horray for Bellwoods!

The only bad thing about Bellwoods are the lines. It's definitely a popular place and one can see (or rather, taste) why once you it down and have one of their local brews. Brewing a variety of beers on site, Bellwoods offers up some delicious beers, including my favorite IPA in Toronto. Sitting on the patio in the summer while sipping on Witchshark IPA is something not to be missed if you're an IPA lover. 

The food menu is unimpressive and from what I saw of the plates the food is average at best, but this is a brewery, so lets review it for what they're here for - beer.

5 stars for the beer, just be sure you're willing to wait a bit in line!
Their vegetarian entree is actually a well-thought-out, tasty unique meal, not something thrown together to satisfy the veg-heads. All the food we had was great, and a lovely selection of beers. Really nice guys too. This place has it going on.
The ribs are delicious and the gumbo soup!
Also if you hold on to your receipt you can come back the next day for a buy one and get the second half off breakfast!
First yelp review ever for me!  I've been to Federal Pizza several times, and have used their drive-up takeout.  Everyone I have brought here has liked it!  Their buildout is a fantastic repurpose of the bank building.  The service has been consistently great, with drinks always refilled.  It can be a little loud if you're in one of the center booths, but nowhere near as bad as the music blasting at Joyride next door.  I remember it being much quieter on Federal's patio, so that's an option!

I have managed to avoid having to use the valet parking.  Thankfully there is now a parking lot available across the street, and they built a crosswalk.

As for the food, I've tried the pepperoni and meatball pizzas, plus a custom pancetta and egg pizza.  All have been very tasty, though the pepperoni is quite oily and the meatball pizza was a tad bland when I ordered it onion-free.  As others have noted, their distinct crust is thin, pillowy, chewy, and very delicious, even if they bake it a bit longer than I would prefer (I guess they're reacting to undercooked complaints by waiting for the crust to lightly scorch).  The meatball sandwich was also good.  The Oreo dessert (Lil' Triple) actually tastes a lot better and less processed than it sounds, and the bombilini are also great when fresh and warm.

Minus 1 star for somewhat high prices, particularly if you customize your toppings.
Came here with my wife just to check it out. We love these little hole in the wall massage places and this was really good. We were treated very professionally and the receptionist was very nice. I definitely recommend it. $30 for an hour for full body massage.
Looooove it! Everything tastes so fresh and delicious! Fries were amazing; thick russet cut perfectly seasoned. Ordered the little burger which is a standard size size since the regular burger is huge! Absolutely love it!
This is an amazing remodel of an aging casino. The old Bill's Gambling Hall and prior to that The Barbary Coast is now The Cromwell. The strips first boutique hotel is a beautiful hotel and casino on the busiest corner on the Las Vegas Strip. There are 188 amazing rooms and suites in the hotel as well as a casino on the main floor. They also added a much needed parking garage for self parking and they also offer valet parking. There is also a fitness center located behind the reception area. The staff is very friendly and knowledgable. With the addition of Drai's Day Club, Nightclub, and After Hours, there will be a 24\/7 non stop party going on at The Cromwell.

The Cromwell has a retail store near the valet entrance named Curios. There are three bars in the casino. The Bound Bar and Lounge is up front near the lobby, The Interlude Bar is located in the center of the Casino right on the main isle, and The Interlude Lounge is located on the opposite side of the Interlude Bar.

Giada restaurant is located on the second floor over looking Las Vegas Blvd. There are escalators just as you walk in the door located near Flamingo Road that will take you up to the restaurant.

The gaming floor has seven pits with two craps tables, including a high limit room. They also have seven slot sections including the High Limit room. The Cromwell is part of Caesars Entertainment, so you can use your Total Reward Card there to earn points.

Overall this is going to be the best spot on the strip when summer gets here. I would recommend to everyone that they go to The Cromwell.
I had heard good things about this place so was looking forward to trying this place. I have to write I was disappointed with this place the moment I walked into the restaurant. 
The wait staff was unfriendly- none of them looked like they wanted to be there. The 
selections of food was not great for some reason I expected more. 
The best part was the sushi was made to order.  But the guy making the sushi was so surly 
in attitude that I was really put off. 
I will not be back to this place. I'm sticking to my fave:  Jasmine Tokyo!
Historically, of course, the region of Dalriada was situated on the west coast of Scotland. However, it seems to have landed very comfortably after its migration across the country; now situated entirely within a magnificent turreted seafront house on the eastern coast at Portobello, it could have done a lot worse. With what estate-agents might term a "well-proportioned" garden and a series of bright and cosy adjoining rooms leading from the front door to the bar, it feels as much like a friend's home as it does a beach pub.

We arrived on a Sunday to find, to my sheer delight, a session in progress. It seems that live music is a regular feature in the Dalriada week, as if its sweeping views of the ocean weren't sufficient entertainment. A session always, always means extra points from me. I wished I'd brought my mandolin so I could join in, but instead took advantage of the glorious weather to sit on the grass outside and admire the view.

As a seaside establishment ought, it caters for pretty much everyone. The bar is well-stocked with a range of beverages and (hoorah) cakes, and they even keep water bowls behind the bar for the many dogs that romp along the sand every day. There was a great family atmosphere when I went, too - little children were out in the garden having a whale of a time.

Something that I, a naturally queue-conscious Brit, particularly enjoyed was the bar experience. The bar room itself is a little on the small side and so, rather than the usual game of squashing around the bar and hoping the serving staff have a supernatural ability to remember the order everyone arrived in, there was a nice little linear queue that wimbled out into the next room. That queue scooted along at a good pace, too; that's impressive given the business they were getting on such an unexpectedly gorgeous day.

It doesn't all hinge on the weather, though. It seems such a lovely place that I'm almost looking forward to the winter - I do love a bitterly cold walk along the beach and I can't think of a nicer way to round it off than with a spot of music and a hot chocolate while gazing out of the window.

Dalriada, please don't go back to the West. Stay here forever so that I can make you part of my every trip to Portobello Beach.
Oooooooooooo the best ever. I rarely write reviews.... But this a MUST!!!
Food amazing... service top notch!!! Thank you Juan!!! We will be soooo back.
Having been to the Venetian several times, it truly is wonderful. You walk into the place and it is dripping with elegance and very worthy of its 5 diamond rating. There's so much to do in this place that it is a vacation in and of itself. I think it's fitting that this place stands where the Sands used to stand. The Sands in its heyday was the height of class, and the Venetian proudly carries that torch.

They spent a tremendous amount of time, research, architectural detail, and of course money to make this place what it is. I've gamed there many times and what stood out to me was how nice and friendly everyone was, right down to the pit bosses. 

The only thing that keeps me from staying there is that constant incense smell that is overpowering when you walk in. Yes, it smells nice, but it dries my eyes out and stuffs my nose up, so I've always defaulted to choosing the Bellagio over the Venetian. But I love visiting and just spending time looking around.
Needed a new Tv, so I went here.
Finally after 8 years it was time for a new tv.

Pretty standard stuff here. Did research online, went to the store and purchased what I needed.

The service was meh!! The guy took maybe 30mins to find a tv that was in stock and one section over. So after purchase the clerk said because of some sort of store policy, I had to lug my tv out of store myself and that I could not use a dolly or cart.

So as I dragged the tv out of the store they said "have a nice day". Not sure if it is policy or the clerk wanted to count his commission but I was pretty disappointed.
I just started taking my dog to Doggie Oasis and seems like she is enjoying this one better than the other doggie day care.  

I bring my dog home and she is tuckered out, so that means she was playing all day and not napping. I like that we can watch our dog on the web cams and we will continue to bring her back. Thanks Doggie Oasis!
Just opened on Park and it's definitely an upgrade from their old spot on Sherbrooke! Their veggie burger hits the spot when you're crazing one and their fries are perfection fresh and hot out of the flyer. Love the new interior and am always glad for delivery when it's too cold outside. Their online delivery page is wonderful. 

Try their Oreo Milkshake if you really want to treat yourself!
Super expensive for what it is. I ordered a sandwich and it was super tiny for $5 - check my pix. Jeez, I can still order an entire sandwich for that price in those hippie cafes back in Toronto lol. Taste was meh, nothing to write home about. 

The latte was overly sweetened, like someone just dumped sugar in it. Ordered another drink - Milky Way and it was still too sweet. 

Fine I like the decor but terrible drinks won't make up for it.
We bought a groupon and thought this place must be awesome for all the great reviews on yelp.

The place was certainly a hole in the wall. The folks that work there were super nice. We ordered a veggie samosa which was great.

 We ordered Chicken Vindaloo- tasted bland and tomatoey. No real Indian spices popping out or any hint of tartness. I'm from San Francisco and we dine at Naan and Curry all the time and their vindaloo was my gateway to Indian Cuisine. I order it at other places and it's great. The chicken was half a breast cut into slithers. No real chunks of bone and meat. There were several pieces of  potato in there. It was like half a potato all together. It tasted like a Filipino goat stew but more bland. 

The lamb kabob was bland too, no real Indian spices popping out. It was like one kabob cut into sauce like slices mixed in this tomatoey sauce with red peppers. It was sweet and bland. 

The samosa was great but I couldn't taste any heart in the meal. No tart, no spices. The people that worked there were again very nice and great at explaining things and talking with us. It was quiet pricey too.
It was really great when it first opened but the last few times it wasn't great. The drinks are good. I got a special with eggs and avocado and it was too heavy and greasy, especially for a healthy place!
Organic Garage is nothing but the BEST! Fabulous staff, excellent service and a variety of products that will make your head spin and your mouth water! Seriously, it's my absolute favourite place to shop. To top it off, they also have great prices!
My wife and I have dined at this restaurant 3 or 4 times, and every time it has not disappointed. The staff is friendly and not pushy. Want to drop a ton of money, they will allow you. Just want to have a couple glasses of wine and share an entree, they will serve you with a smile. 

Last time we were there we had a nice bottle Orvieto that cost $35. My wife and I had the carpaccio which was perfect. Rounded out the meal with some mussels and clams, and a spicy pasta. 

You can sit outside and check out all the casino action without feeling like you are sitting in the middle of the casino. 

I will be going back.
First off I have to admit my buddies Dad used to own this place in the 60's so I am partial to it.  Use to hang out here when the Roxy Burlesque was still in business down the street.  Great bar food and burgers.  Always friendly staff.  Usually can get something to eat until at least 1am (not many places in Cleveland serve late).  If they still have perch on the menu buy it.  For me it is more of the Cleve vibe here that attracks me.
I tried this place after hearing from someone that they have authentic Mexican tacos. Being that I love Mexican food I knew I had to try this place. I had the Rajas Taco which was delicious along with the Papas tostadas. The corn tortillas are delicious and are made in house and the taco was great. My favorite though was the Papas tostadas it was so delightful to my taste buds to keep my food vegan I just ask them to remove the creamy cilantro sauce and cheese and topped my food with there red salsa sauce that was amazing! The only downside is the parking but other than that this is a cool spot!
When I stay in Vegas, I tend to stay downtown, and the Walgreens at the end of the Fremont Experience is where I end up when purchasing little things to use on my trip. This time around, I forgot to bring a charger for my iphone in the rental car, but they sold a USB charger than plugs into the cigarette lighter plug, for $5. They also have assorted snacks, water, drinks, sunscreen. etc. The location is convenient if you're staying downtown. The customer service was usually pretty friendly more than 50% of the time.
I am generally not a buffet person.  The exception is for breakfast.  On top of that, it was free with our room.  That is a great value.  The mimosa brunch was great for us.  They serve it until 2pm.  That is awesome.  We have no desire to wake up early while in Las Vegas.

There are endless options.  None of which are generic.  Each has a unique touch.  The caramel pancakes were excellent.  The cheesy hashbrowns were also quite good.  They also freshly sliced thick cut bacon.  The continously filled mimosas were a nice touch as well.

There are so many desert options.  It was hard to select just a few.

The line can get quite long on weekends.  Plan ahead.
Totally would not expect this place to be so on point. Friendly and informative staff with delicious Thai food. Super helpful owner that will make suggestions if you're not sure what to get. Personally, I love the steamed fish wrapped in banana leaf. Soft, delicate with coconut essence...it was great! Prices are fair relative to other thai restaurants and portions are okay, (a little on the small side) but still worth a visit. Try the thai tea too, it's awesome!
This is a newer location of the breakfast\/brunch chain Eggsmart. It has the same, basic, breakfast foods and nice, big breakfast combos. We started going to this location a few months back when we realized it was open and go every once and awhile. We've always had pretty consistent service and the food as been as good as one expects from this type of place. I usually get their two eggs combo with bacon and toast and I like it because it's basic. Prices are pretty good (although your non-chain greasy spoon will likely have comparable for cheaper). Today I had the spinach and feta cheese omelet and wasn't a fan. Too much feta was rolled up in the omelet and it was all your could taste. Will go with my basic again next time.
Came here with my girlfriends one Sunday afternoon. This place will take a long time to serve your food - as it took them almost an hour to give us our food. So make sure you give yourself lots of time! It is definitely a lazy brunch place!

Definitely recommend the pancakes! Beware of the portion sizes - they are huge!
Lovely brunch, tasty and healthy, reasonably priced, awesome staff, cute place with fresh-cut flowers... what more do I need? Nothing.
I can almost always find something to wear here, at a decent price when you use a coupon or come during a sale.  It's safe and work appropriate.  Most everything I have ever bought has held up extremely well.  

Unfortunately They don't carry the Heritage line any more, and they shrank their Monogram area too.  Women's and petites have taken over a chunk of what used to be a half\/half store.

The "special" store design of multiple little closet-like rooms has its issues.  The shoes in the middle\/cash-wrap room seems impossible to leisurely sit down and try sizes in.  Some folded items are shoved into low shelves and are difficult to locate.  The clearance room is also ridiculously small.

The absolute best prices can be found when they do an additional big percent (like 40%) off of clearance already marked down to Final Sale.  Unfortunately, with the tiniest clearance area I've seen in a BR, you're more likely to find marked-down stock in another location.
This place is awesome! Definitely authentic!!!

My two favourite dishes are the rice flour rolls and the chicken pho. The rice flour rolls are always fresh whenever I'm there! And the chicken pho is always flavourful!! mmmm....just thinking of it makes me want some!

My boyfriend is Vietnamese and he agrees that this place is authentic and one of the best Vietnamese restaurants he has ever eaten at.

Prices are very reasonable too!
We were sitting right next to the entrance, and the howling page boys of Storm Emily were rolling out a red carpet of dead leaves ahead of her arrival, pushing as many through the revolving door as they possibly could. Perhaps it was the Bloody Vintages and espresso liqueurs, perhaps it was Christmas cheer, or perhaps it was just that the place is generally pretty cosy, but somehow the Yelpers brunching within remained warm and snug despite the elements.

The talk, once we'd settled on The Vintage as our destination, had been all of gypsy eggs. The menu just said: gypsy eggs. No explanation, no elaboration, just... gypsy eggs. The curiosities of many were piqued (though clearly not sufficiently to Google). So it was that, despite our waitress Katie reciting a mind-boggling, mouth-watering, eye-popping range of specials and grazing options, more than half of us still put forward our order for the mysterious travelling ova.

There was also some discussion of a coffee laced with Mozart white chocolate liqueur. Amazing! Were it not for the fact that I don't drink a) coffee or b) alcohol, that would have been top of my list. It sounded awesome.

And then came the gypsy eeeeeggs. *angelic choir noise* Served in a skillet atop an attractive dark wooden board (which also bore a single piece of bread), these are baked eggs in a rich tomato sauce with butter beans and chorizo. Yep. They were absolutely as delicious as they sound. With the recent addition of a teeny Le Creuset skillet-for-one to my kitchen, courtesy of Bro F, I have vowed to attempt to reproduce these marvels for myself.

It's impressive that, despite a good capacity and high ceilings (high enough that a Christmas tree was perching comfortably above the door without having to duck), The Vintage retains so much intimacy and character. It's worth being aware though that as it's devoted to a more exclusive, artisan approach to its bar-stock, you might not find some of the spirits and liqueurs you'd get easily elsewhere. Not a problem for one such as me who just wants a pot of tea and an OJ, mind you...

A special note here must go to Katie, who was so much that was excellent about our visit. Witty, warm, and with a pretty epic singing voice, she whizzed effortlessly between tables in the ever-more-busy eatery, taking and delivering orders and wisecracking smoothly with customers. She even found time to jolly our whole table into a rowdy group rendition of Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer, though none of us was quite able to match her pipes in anything more than enthusiasm. Bravo, ma'am - you'll go down in his-tor-yyy!
good food, fresh sliced meats and cheese, fresh bread, good people, great prices and the cheddar broccoli soup is great. a great value for what you get, maybe the best value for none fried food anywhere
The ambiance, atmosphere, and overall cuisine was amazing! Loved the hands on approach and vibe of the restaurant! I got a little lost on what everything was but everything tasted really delicious! Definitely a great Thursday night dinner spot.
First person that came was nice, efficient but broke something. 2nd person left 15 minutes early, still lots of dust and fluff on the floor, kitchen sink dirty and bathroom mirrors not even touched but did not bother properly finishing the job. I mentioned it to the owner who did not apologize and just said he would send someone else the next time...
I have to say that I got someone on a short notice though. But overall, disappointed and will not hire again.
Referred to by home warranty company. Started off okay with a timely and pleasant response. Ended up being a nightmare with the company claiming "no access" to the heater unit in my attic. They wanted me to have a contractor come out and put in an access through the ceiling, roof, or wall and tip the unit on its side for access. After lots of research I had another company come out, look at the heater, it was as simple as a blown fuse and cap replacement. Only a $255 repair and no access problems. I don't know why A&R couldn't do the same. I would have spent thousands on creating an access not to mention the construction headache. The home warranty company reimbursed me for the repair even though they originally said they wouldn't let me use anyone besides A&R.
I enjoyed the atmosphere and the service was great. However, the food was drenched in oil and really left both my husband and I uninterested in returning. We were so hoping to love this place because as vegans, there are so few healthy restaurants in the valley.
That moment when you order your "favorite" thing... when you taste it, it's so delicious you get angry at all the impostures that made you order it to begin with!

This happens to me anytime I adventure away from my usual order at lux.  This has happened to me here the first time I've ordered the americano, the yogurt parfait, and the scones. The bakers here are legit le cordon bleu graduates from what I hear (and taste).  

The brown sugar macadamia scone is this glistening golden glimmer of a pastry with a crumbly biscuit texture on the outside and gooey butter cream in the center.  When I first laid eyes on the one selected for me I actually thought "she gave me the good one!" It had me asking deep questions about the universe.  

At times, the line is long but no worries the staff actually is efficient and gets through it in minutes.  The only downside is the coffee condiment area is booty to booty with the people ordering & paying.  No worries as everyone moves through pretty quickly. 

The decor and art at lux is perfection: hip coffee atmosphere achieved.  Literally, the best people watching with 2 outdoor areas.

Usually I'll eat inside and then enjoy my pastry outside because I like to bring my Jack Russell terrier and tie her on the bench in front of pane bianco.  

My final tip- if it sounds or looks good definitely order it.
I'm a big chicken and waffle fan, but I've never had it quite like this. Yelp brought me here as I was looking for a new place I hadn't been before around this area of the strip. 

I went with the buffalo bleu waffle chicken sandwich along with the side of fries. The sandwich is a great size portion, however I do wish you'd get more fries. I like buffalo chicken, however I've never had it with waffles. For my taste buds, it wasn't the best combination. The sandwich was good, and I love the concept, but my tongue didn't agree with this pairing. For me, I'd go with the original fried chicken and waffle sandwich next time I go.

The lemonade is excellent here, you'll definitely be wanting more. Staff was cool, and always checked up as we are and kept our drinks full. As a regular Vegas traveler, this place I will be back and try more options they have here.
I bought a groupon for Wabora a while ago and decided to use it with my friend.  
First I'd like to state the pros and why I gave it 3 out of 5 stars.  The food is good.  It's nothing special.  It's presented well and the taste of the food is good but again nothing special.  The establishment is nice and is in a posh trendy area.  After ordering the food took approximately 15-20 (about average time) minutes and looked quite good.  I ordered the Fire Chicken and my friend had ordered  the Spicy Pork Bulgogi.
Some cons, my dish was about $27 and my friends dish about the same at $30.  He's not Korean but I am.  To pay a whooping $30 each for our dishes was pretty outrageous.  To go out to an actual Korean restaurant and order $60 of food, you'd end up with a feast to feed 8-10 people.  The ambiance was nice though and the background sound was loud but not overly crazy.  
I probably won't return to Wabora only because I feel that it's overpriced for what you're getting.  I'm not discouraging others from going though.  The food was good and  the place is classy.
Target stores seem to be very similar in layout, product placement and obviously, pricing--so the differences between them do not usually stand out to me. This store is in a great location. For the most part, the staff seems helpful although the general attitude seems to have diminished in recent years. Their lane management also does not seem to be on par with what it used to be as there is usually a wait. However, overall I like this store. I can say with confidence that I will seek out a Target before succumbing to the dark side of Wal-Mart.
NIGHTCLUB rating only.

I walked in during feasting hours and its cool, small, OK bar.
Apparently this is one of the only places to get down on a Sunday. Ladies you can get a 2 ladies in free flyer at Tao - so get there early and you dont pay. 
It also says on the club flyer that its a bathouse. Um NO. I got kicked out of line for wearing rhinestone open toed shoes in flip flop style. OK a girl with ugly kitten heel flea market flip flops got in and I didn't? WTF. I explained the the very cool bouncer who was going to let me in - since I was just meandering around alone - look the flyer said bath house, I have heels, but I have my hot-piece suit on under and I can put my heels on. I was even going to tip the guy for putting me in GList line.

So I step to the side for 2 minutes, show him my fabulous heels and then I am told that they are at max capacity and I can wait in their lounge. I think it was some senior bouncer that cut me off. What a load of crap. I dont know - did they not like my flossy Obama top? I was already stamped for entry - WTF?

Lavo - awash.
Don't waste your time. Bad wine selection. Bogus specials. If you're going to spend your money on wine. Their are several other places to drink wine.
Belle attraction où on y découvre différents  activités  intéressantes .Comme aller voir des documentaires  .
Huge location and great selection of goods. It's much larger than Dollar plus that's across from Woodman's off Watt's rd.
J'ai passé une super belle soirée hier à la cabane à sucre de Laurent Godbout, située pour la 4e année de suite a la Scena au Vieux-Port. C'était la premiere fois que je mettais les pieds ici et je dois dire que c'est un endroit époustouflant. Des plafonds de 20 pieds et plus, des murs vitrés qui laissent les dernières lumières du jour baigner la salle, une terrasse offrant une vue imprenable du fleuve Saint-Laurent... Pas étonnant que ça soit un lieu populaire pour des mariages.

Dès notre arrivée, nous avons été accueillies avec un cocktail de bienvenue. La mise en place des boissons était assez ludique; des pots masons avec un fond de sirop d'érable étaient vissés sur une étagère et les serveurs attendait qu'on en dévisse un pour ensuite l'allonger avec du vin mousseux. Tout ça accompagné de popcorn maison assaisonné à la moutarde et caramel!

Full disclosure- ce n'est pas réellement une cabane à sucre. Oui, il y a amplement de sirop d'érable sur le menu mais je dirai plutôt que c'est un restaurant qui fait honneur aux produits du terroir québécois- par exemple, la plupart des alcools venait d'ici (rhum Chic Choc, gin Ungava). 

Tout comme l'apéro, le reste de la soirée était ponctuée de surprises. On s'est régalées des pilons de poulet, du canard confit, des chips de kale (lol), d'un vol au vent géant avec des morceaux de ris de veau, des boulettes de dinde, d'une soupe à base de lait de saumon fumé et œuf poché... C'était bon mais on est loin des oreilles de crisses et des bines traditionnelles. Pour clouer le repas, un bar de desserts est littéralement descendu du plafond, des beignes glacés sont apparus sur des mini arbres en bois, et on a eu droit à de la tire d'érable sur du lait glacé. On a passé le reste de la soirée sur un sugar high. 

Le service était efficace et j'ai aimé le fait qu'il n'y avait qu'un seul service, alors on a pu prendre notre temps pour tout déguster. Il y avait des plats plus réussis que d'autres mais en somme on a beaucoup apprécié notre expérience et plus particulièrement la créativité du chef. J'ai déjà hâte de voir ce qu'il va nous concocter l'an prochain!
I absolutely Love this place. It is one of the most spectacular Sports bars on the west side. They have EVERYTHING here. Legends is kind of tucked away near the West Towne mall and the next most recognizable thing nearby is a Chucky Cheese. Straight away the only qualm I have with the place is the parking lot. Not enough parking what-so-ever. Not the end of the world though. You walk in through a corner entrance to reveal a huge wrap-around bar with TONS of tables and stools surrounding it.

There is a huge screen at the front along with dart boards to get you started on the Sports bar feel. Pool table in the opposing corner with a few slots as well. Now the kickers of this place. First the big screen at the front? That is mainly reserved for very large UFC fights!!!! YES one of very few bars in Madison will show them because of how costly they are to show. Can't get a great view of the screen? don't worry. They have probably over 15 other TV's surrounding the bar attached to the ceiling. I am not exaggerating one bit. You can't escape a TV in this place even if you wanted to. Which is awesome because they show pretty much every kind of sport known to man. The outdoor patio on the side if large and plentiful of seating where they still play the audio for games and yet you still have a clear view inside the window at current games.

Head around to the back of the bar and there is a full-size volley ball court! Leagues and all. The other immediate thing you will notice is the awesome new Tiki Shack bar they HAND BUILT with a large (around 50") TV mounted against the wall. They don't stock a ton back there but another pitcher of mediocre beer? Sure! They have bean bag boards and sometimes some special events like $1 Cheese burgers and not too long ago they even had a full-size lamb cooking back there! IT WAS DELICIOUS. They also have live music back there sometimes with a little stage in the corner, no real big names or anything but more than what any other kind of place would have.

Most importantly, the employees and the family that owns this place is spectacular. They make you feel like a regular even if this is your first time there. If your a regular you feel like family. The owner of this place is always genuinely concerned with how you might be doing and how you are in his company and the establishment. If not my favorite #1 bar it is a very close second but I might be brave and say it is.

Most nights end up as "Legends?" "Yep
Concept hyper intéressant. Un fast-food végétarien, quasiment végétalien au centre-ville. Très beau décor moderne- on ne se croirait pas dans un fast food. Menu court: 8 choix de salades fraîches, un pain magique (provenant de Hof Kelsten, alors vraiment fromagé et magique) et des sodas aux fruits maison. Les légumes sont coupés à la machine devant nous dès que la commande est passée. C'est simple et savoureux. Étant une fan finie de Mandy's c'est dur pour moi d'affirmer avec conviction que je reviendrai souvent ici... Mais je recommande quand même leurs salades!
I was ready to write a scathing review, as I also was annoyed when they moved even farther from my neighborhood and my beloved turkey burger has been removed from the menu (a while ago I believe).  My friend and j waited for quite a while for a table, though they weren't that busy, especially in the bar.  Thankfully we could relax on the couch in the bar area and chat, so it wasn't bat big a deal.  I also don't get what's up with the "reserved" signed tables, and now understand why some restaurants don't take reservations.

However, beyond having to ask twice for a to-go box, the service once seated was excellent.  The food was also superb.  I had the $6 Wednesday special of chicken strips and salt & pepper fries, and it was amazing.  The serving size was generous, the food was served piping hot, and the presentation was even very nice for a glorified chicken basket!  Their thin strips of chicken breast were breaded with a subtly spicy, cinnamon-infused crunch.  The fries also tasted a bit more cinnamony than usual but they were probably fried with the chicken or just absorbed some of the chicken's aroma or something!  A shared slice of cheesecake was also really good, creamy and not too light or too heavy, with a light Nutella-like layer and a fresh slices strawberry to compliment it.

I grudgingly admit I'll be back, despite my annoyance with downtown in general.  I even found very convenient parking in the garage, so all I can complain about is the construction around the area and being stuck behind a bus.  Oh, I know a complaint I could make!  The seating was pretty awful.  I don't get why they would do half-booths where half of the party is stuck in a relatively uncomfortable chair!  Not a fan, and I miss the old familiar decor too...though my dining companion loved all of the colorful plastic\/glass decorations like the giant thing above the bar.
Charlotte Premium Outlets really delivers on the outlet shopping part. It is an outdoor setup similar to the other Premium Outlet locations. The store selection is good and the layout was fine. My biggest problem was the parking lot. It was a nightmare to navigate and there were a ton of pissed off shoppers trying to get in and out.
Amazing!!! Love local places that treat people like people. They are amazing and their donuts are even better!!!!
This is a great place to have a cold brew or a nice drink. It has a good atmosphere and the staff at the bar are great. They are friendly, fun, and knowledgeable. The best part is the music, great selection. If your looking for a good selection of whiskey this is the place.

Plus where can you go where the bartender can tie his own bowtie. As the Doctor says... "Bowties are cool!
This place was recommended by the place I bought my wedding dress and as much as I wanted to like this place, my experience was terrible. I did not even get a 2nd fitting as she thought she had altered my dress when it actually was WAY too small for me! She suggested I diet (seriously? to fix your mistake?) or that I wear spanx! I asked for a refit and the breast area was still not at all fitted. When I brought it home, I felt sad that my dress was so not flattering and luckily found another AMAZING seamstress to fix what this one couldn't. 

To sum up: rude, does not listen to what the client wants and does not deliver! I called the shop where I bought the dress to have the name removed and just want to save other people the trouble to go there.

The other place I went to (and should have gone in first place) is Cherries.
Not bad. Typical beer and wings sports bar. Good for a large group and kids.  They do support the community sports, so for that I would go back.
This place is actually pretty neat. I loved the Boars heads on the wall and the old western type feel to it. The drinks were really good, well made and strong but for some reason I really enjoyed the food. For being bar food it was actually pretty spectacular. Any drink ya like at a cheap price and some cool stuff to look at. Whats not to like? They got big TV's and fast service. (eBay style) A++++++++++++ Great Seller!!!!!! Will do business again!
The only downside to this place, I think, is that it needs more seating.  I've heard that this one has more than the other Vegas location, but my friend and I had to wait a few minutes to get a place to sit for two.  Other than that... the service was great.  I'm a vegetarian, and they let me swap out the meat that was on the menu for a side dish, so I was able to make my meal even more healthy.  It's a fun place, because they have two sides to the menu: "Healthy" and "Happy" (i.e., not healthy, haha!).  So, if you're friends with a super healthy person, or a super unhealthy person, there's something for either one!  I would say it's more on the expensive side, just for a small meal; but I enjoyed what I had, and definitely plan on coming back.
Absolutely the best tacos I have ever had. Very quick service and the people are very nice. A ton of options and very spicy. There was a bit of a language barrier, but you can pay for the tacos inside if you only have a card and outside in cash. I had the potato taco and I went back for a second that night. The tortillas are soft and handmade and the toppings are fresh. Seriously, go there. $2 a taco cannot be beat for this quality of product.
I may be the worst customer a moving company can deal with. And they dealt with me so well I can't help but give them five stars. 

With all the rave reviews I received from friends and yelp, I couldn't help but choose Camelback to help with my move. I didn't want to have to force my friends to help move my big items. I received a fair quote for moving the large items only. I soon realized though, that it was unrealistic for me to move all the boxes myself. However, I failed to inform them of this. 

When the movers arrived, they found lots of fun stuff to move. Did they complain? No. Did they yell at me? No. Did they tell me they needed more people? No. Did they tell me I had to reschedule? No.

Nothing broke or was destroyed or lost, which has happened in nearly every other move I've ever had done.

They came, moved what was there and did one hell of a job. It took longer, and I paid more, but it was very reasonable for the trick move I played on them. They were even fine when it got to be nightfall and my neighbor boys were running into the moving truck.  Well done. Highly recommended.
A friend took me here as a birthday gift, and I really loved my time here, watching the dolphins and getting to see the tigers and lions!  Being so close to these beautiful creatures was an amazing experience.  I love all the cute tricks the dolphins do!  There are "shows" every fifteen minutes, where the trainers who work with the dolphins bring them out and show people their different tricks, as well as tell you about the dolphins, themselves.  The gift shops for both the Dolphin Habitat and the Secret Garden are full of trinkets you can buy to remember the trip (in case videos and pictures aren't enough - lots of photo ops here!).  It's expensive to get in for non-locals, so just keep that in mind before planning a visit, especially if you're bringing a large group or a big family.
Came here last week. The food was really good and they serve you plenty of it. That's always a plus. When we first arrived, we moved to 3 different tables because of different issues. But I didn't let that ruin my time there because I came for the food lol. Again all of our food was really good and you can tell it's a real authentic Mexican restaurant, not a typical chain restaurant. 

All in all great food
Another one of my go-to spots in Lakewood. The servers are friendly, and make it a point to get to know their regulars. The food is ALWAYS delicious, and they are always updating their specials and seasonal menus.
Another great thing about this place is the crowd... Young and old, everybody is super chill. I've never witnessed or heard of any fights or rowdiness.
The only downside about The Rush Inn is the prices... they can run very high, especially if you're a craft beer drinker ($8+ for a tall Dortmunder). Fortunately for Lakewood folk, there are often coupons in the local circular, and they have great food specials (wing nights, burger nights, etc).
I was not really impressed with the pies here. The setting is nice and quaint, but my review reflects the pie, because the place is called Pie.

The blueberry pie was so-so. There was enough fruit filling, but it didn't really taste of blueberries. Plus the crust was bready, dry, and bland. Not flaky at all, and not buttery enough.

Stay away from the chocolate mousse pie. They commit the cardinal sin of putting gelatin in their mousse. Sure it makes it hold its shape, but the mousse loses its smoothness, and the gelatin blunts the flavour of the chocolate. The crust was likewise bland, dry, and not flaky.

I suspect that the recipes are the way they are because they are trying to make their pies low-fat. Low-fat crust = dry boring crust. Gelatin in mousse means you need fewer egg yolks, which means less fat. If you like your desserts low-fat, that's up to you, but to me that's just a recipe for torture, so I can't recommend Wanda's for pie. Some of their grain salads looked interesting, however, perhaps I'll go back and try them.
Amazing business! I messed up the start and end times and they still did everything seamlessly. I will make sure to use them again to our next party!
I love it! Good curry and great buffet price. Tandoori pollo is awesome. The place is very nice.
What I had was good .. jerk chicken combo with rice and cabbage and gravy on top , and a patty .. very tasty, will stop back 3.6 to 4
I know.. an update with the same rating, but I just cannot get over how amazing of an experience it is every time I walk into this store. I was in there most recently a few days ago, hoping to find a bit of good luck in the clothes department, as I had been wearing cargo pants forever. That in combination with not being able to fit into most of my cargo pants, I was dying for a skirt.

Jinia and I talked for at least an hour as I got to see all the new things going on and catch up. I ended up trying on a few pieces I never thought would work with me, including a skirt made of neckties and a strapless mini dress. The end result? All of them looked fabulous and I walked out with them all. The necktie skirt is my absolutely favorite piece and everyone that's seen it thinks it's a true gem. The necktie line also includes brooches and purses.. definite must sees! 

If you haven't been yet, you're truly missing out!
I really do love this place. The food is heathy and delicious and the servers (especially Tony) make it fun and a great experience. The best thing I've had is the tuna tartare something or whatever (just ask them and they can tell you). SO much flavor. It's delicious.
I usually have a pretty good dining experience here. I never go for anything but happy hour. They have a solid HH menu with many options to choose from. My coworkers and I recently went for sushi and drinks. This visit left me feeling unimpressed and solidified my love for Kona Grill. The sushi was...OK. Nothing great this time around. The others in my party felt the same about their food. It took a good 15 minutes to get our check and another 15 to get our cards back after paying. Of course I was in a rush but even if I wasn't, that's a long time to wait to pay your server. Probably won't be back any time soon.
AMAZING! Great food and outdoor seating is beautiful. The service was nice,friendly and quick. We had the 5th street salad and half of a pizza. Very crispy and big.
Personable service on the patio on a Sunday funday double date.  We light railed it from central Phoenix and walked just a few paces to this spot previously the tavern on mill.

We shared nachos (do it) and I did the Delish margarita mule happiness.  Actual fresh lime- woah that's rare!

They were out of quite a few beers and the flight did not come labeled so it was a blind tasting pretty much.
Crepes are awesome. Wife had a combo of the breakfast and BLT while I had the Cloud 9 (Nutella and Bananas). Staff is friendly. Service is fast. Very clean restaurant.
On Veterans Day we were dinning at Denny's next door. They came in yelling that if anyone had parked in their parking lot they had tow trucks coming.  Apparently whoever was managing that day was making sure that people were getting towed if they felt the vets were not at Wendy's but Denny's. Not that I don't agree that if it happens on a regular basis it should be addressed.  I mean it's one day a year.  All the times I've gone through there NO ONE was searching for parking in order to go eat at Wendy's. No better way to not get people to frequent your establishment then throwing a fit! GREAT JOB MANAGER! I actually use to work for Wendy's when I was a kid but I find this behavior disgusting. Also to be noted I had ordered from this location previously had they'd gotten it wrong a few times. The unpatriotic behavior just sealed the deal and I will no longer be going to any Wendy's establishment. I'm sure the gaggle of vets that were there will no longer be purchasing anything from their either.
I want to give this place five stars.  I want to, but I can't.  "as good as it gets" is a super hard description to live up to.  Also, I have a really hard time giving out five stars.  So maybe it's five star and I just have some weird brain thing that prevents me from giving out that last star, but here were my issues with it:

It's not for everyone.  Why?  Well, for starters, the menu is pretty limited.  If you're a huge seafood fan, for example, or LOVE steak...but neither is featured prominently (or at all) on the menu...you're sort of forced to leave your comfort zone to order.  

Now that is right in MY wheelhouse...I love trying stuff I've never had before, or never heard of before...but it's not in EVERYONE's wheelhouse.  My wife, for example, had a tough time finding anything that didn't...scare her.  So she ended up getting chicken.  And not that the chicken was BAD.  (it wasn't)...but it's nothing she'd order at any other restaurant.  

When we left I asked her, "Would you come back?" and she answered "That's a hard question to answer."  Which means, that it's really NOT that hard a question to answer, because other places she'd have just said, "YES!"  But she explained as follows:

It's difficult to compare Legume to other restaurants she loves because she didn't get something she loves from Legume in order to be able to compare it to something she loved from another restaurant.  Because the menu is limited, you're you may find yourself having to default to something you really wouldn't prefer, only because it seems like a better option than things you may have never tried.

Okay...with that out of the way, a couple minor issues:

The waiter wasn't super.  He wasn't bad.  But he wasn't super.  That alone wouldn't have dropped this review to four from five stars, but see above.

The bar was slow.  This is sort of a good problem for Legume, but sort of a crappy one for customers...the bar was PACKED, when we got there.  PACKED.  So I get why the bar was slow...but it was just something that detracted from the five-ness of the star rating.

The coffee was so-so.  We did the french press, and it was fine, but not great.  I love a good coffee with dessert.

Things I loved:

I had stinging nettle soup.  Stinging.  Nettle.  I ate weed soup for dinner.  That is COOL.  And it was good.

Sommelier.  Any nice restaurant should have someone that can steer you toward a good wine that compliments your food nicely.  Legume has one.  

Seriously...stinging nettle soup.  

I had the goat loin\/shank\/sausage with harissa and japanese knotweed.  Do you see a trend here?  They cook WEEDS and make them taste good.  That's AWESOME!!!

The goat was good.  Not great...but definitely good.  When I had bites with the knotweed and rice, the sauce, goat, and knotweed balanced out really nicely...but bites that were heavy with knotweed were bitter and because of the way it was prepared it was hard to get consistent bites throughout.  Still...really good.  Happy with my goat, I just wonder if knotweed was the best choice for the dish.  Was it awesome BECAUSE it was knotweed?  Yes.  But could it have tasted better if it had been something less imaginative, but more palatable?  Maybe.

Pretty restaurant inside.  I liked the inventiveness of the food.  I liked the ambiance.  I liked the philosophy overall.  I'd like to have given it five stars, but I feel like it suffers from limited menu, less than five star wait staff, okay coffee, and maybe (ironically) TOO imaginative dishes.
A southwest PA institution. Great chocolate. But we go for the sundaes. Be prepared to wait in line if you go after dinner.
4.5 stars for what it is and this is only my first time and i haven't tried their homemade empanadas or arepas .. got the dollar tacos on Taco Tuesday, beef and shredded chicken and they were great.. checked in for free tortilla chips but i would suggest to queso dip with them. Also got an Inca Cola from Peru and a Corona
The service here was so terrible. We had to ask to get drinks, food, and water. The food itself was pretty good. We had the nachos for an appetizer, which was stacked about a foot high.

The golf is great and the view is fantastic.

Our main food did not arrive together, which was a little confusing. The pizza arrived first, followed by soup 5 mins later and chips and salsa 10 mins after that. We canceled that.
Bon  endroit  pour  aller   déjeuner  entre  amis  ,  Je    vous  conseille  en  petit  groupe   de  personne  car  les   tables  sont  petites  . Il est  impossible  de  réserver  pour  un   en  fin de  semaine   ,car il ne prennent  pas  de réservation . Ce qui fait  que l'attente  est longue  !!!
I cannot speak for the customer service, as I received a small "chocolate chocolate chip" cake as a thank you present from a colleague.

It was super moist, chocolatey, not too sweet, and delicious.  I really appreciated it!  It wasn't the best I have ever had, and was rather "conservative" (traditional, classic without a twist), but it's definitely above what you'd get at, say, Boston Market or KFC for chocolate cake.  Or laying out on a table in a plastic clamshell at the grocery store.  I prefer my chocolate cake to be more fudge-y or ganache-laden, but their cake is still solid.
Mmmm j'adore ce BBQ coréen. Le peu d'épices qu'ils mettent sur les viandes et fruit de mer et la sauce teriyaki est délicieuse. 

Je suis allé deux fois et les deux fois j'ai trouvé les grillades délicieuses. Il y a quand même une grande variété de sushi et sont délicieux. Il y a aussi d'autres petits plats que vous pourrez déguster.

Un gros  Pour les moules géantes, les crevettes, les calmars frits et pétoncles panées. Ah oui et les ananas sur le gril, c'est un gros delice. miam

Je ne sais pas pourquoi, mais le poulet était so so...bref. Je ne prendrai pas du poulet, je n'ai pas tant tripé.

Bref je recommande. La dernière fois que je suis allée, le resto à perdu des points dans le service à la clientèle. Au début, le serveur était super serviable, et venais nous voir. Après avoir reçu notre première commande, le serveur à changé. Il ne venait jamais nous voir. On a dû se lever 2 fois pour demander de l'eau et demander si on allait recevoir tel truc qu'on avait demandé, car ils avaient oublié...

Finalement, le resto est ouvert jusqu'à 2h Am YEA! Et de plus en soirée, c'est environs 26$ par personnes plus taxes. Ce qui extrêmement bien pour tout ce qu'on mange.
I am surprised at the people complaining about the service, because we found the service to be fine. Especially given how busy and cramped it was. There were no tables, but they got us seats at the bar. The music was maybe a little loud, but I enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening. The place looks like a dive, it's a total hole in the wall, with no signs to speak of, but I liked the weird atmosphere of weird, old "ghetto blasters" on the walls and pics of Arnold in Terminator. It's random, just go with it...
But the food....OH the FOOD! We were told that the squash poutine was a must have, so I ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak, while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel. The mackerel was served first. It arrived raw, on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it. My friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting, with a delicious marinade. Next came by bulgogi sandwich. Fresh, delicious bread and amazing bulgogi. Was very pleased. Finally the "poutines" arrived. I should say that it was not what we were expecting. I assumed it would be squash on top of fries. But in fact the squash was the fries. THey were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce "gravies" and scallions and some other stuff that I could neither make out, nor even see clearly (dim lighting). It doesn't matter okay....this stuff was HEAVEN! Both my friend and I took a bite and looked at each other...and proclaimed our new favourite food. 
Other people in our party got the wings, which looked amazing and they said they were and The Loosey, which was also proclaimed as delicious. So basically there were no wrong moves. The drink menu was very adventurous...more so than we were, because we didn't take the plunge, although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them. And splitting the bill for my friend with two others (her birthday), my two "tapas" and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $30. The prices are extremely reasonable...and honestly once you try this stuff...I mean, I don't want to give them any ideas, but I would have paid more for that fine, fine food. I will be back. Need me some more of that poutine!
I will just say that this is only the second time I have ever been to an eye doctor. In my entire life. I've never had issues with my eyesight fortunately enough. One of my coworkers recommended Gilbert Family Eye Care and when it comes to doctors, I'd rather go on recommendations than what is closest to my house. 

Being that this was only my 2nd eye exam and my previous one I don't remember all that well, I walked in not really knowing what to expect. 

The receptionist had me fill out the typical forms and I only waited a matter of a few minutes before I was brought back to begin my exam. I went through a series of tests in which each one was explained to me beforehand. It was very comforting to know exactly what I was getting into. Rather than having my pupils dilated I had a photo taken of them, which saves the drama. It was so quick and simple and the results of it were amazing to look at. The back of your eyes look like crazy planets. Just sayin.

The doctor went through the test results and the pictures for me and told me things I never even knew about my eyes and double checked before I left to ensure all my questions about any of the results had been answered. He was super friendly and informative and I felt completely comfortable there. 

What do I wish was different? I inquired about receiving a digital copy of the photographs that were taken and was told they would be emailed to me. After waiting a day I called back, and was told they would be sent today. I still haven't received them, which means I have to find time to call back tomorrow.
Wow! This place is amazing. The food was fantastic. I heard about the long lines here, so I decided to come here around 3am Sunday night. I still waited in line for about 15 minutes, but I noticed around 4am there were a few empty seats at the bar and no line.

Apps:
Steamed Little Neck Clams - they were served in a garlic butter sauce and they were delicious.

Steamed New Zealand Mussels - mussels were fresh tasting and very plump. Great garlic sauce. Excellent dish!!!!

Dozen Raw Oysters - very fresh and huge. Excellent oysters!!!

Bouillabaisse - I ordered it spicy (5). It was amazing. The broth was so good and the seafood was very fresh tasting. They gave me a side of jasmine rice to mix with it. I will definitely be ordering this again.

Combo Pan Roast - this was also excellent, but I personally don't care for the creamy tomato sauce. If you like this type of sauce though, I am sure you will love it.

I understand why everyone says to come here now. This place is amazing and I absolutely recommend that you try it.

The Shock Top on tap was pretty good too.
We went here for dinner last night. I have been a fan of custom made pizzas and I had pretty good experiences with similar places (Pielogy, Project Pie). 

Their menu has a vast variety of options. You can choose from regular crust to whole wheat or gluten-free. You can either choose to build-your-own pizzas or you can choose from their special menu that offers ingredients that are not made available for the build your own. They had interesting choices like clams, goat cheese, Hawaiian, etc. 

I went for one of their specials: the Fig & Prosciutto with goat cheese, arugula on whole wheat while my boyfriend had his custom built. Both pizzas tasted amazing! The fig preserve on my pizza was sweet and tangy but it was perfectly balanced out by the saltiness of the cheese and meat. Also, since I did not have much sauce on mine, the crust came out super crispy! The custom pizza had a lot of ingredients in it so the crust was not as crisp but still the flavor was excellent. I guess in cases of thin crust pizzas, less is more. 

I would definitely recommend this place. If you're in the mood for custom made pizzas but don't want to drive to the strip or Summerlin, you have to try it out. Plus, Halloween City just opened up right next to them.
***** Five Stars!

This is another great vegan option if you find yourself in the downtown area of Las Vegas. It is located inside Container Park. It is on the right side of the park as soon as you walk in through the front entrance on the first level. The restaurant is very small. I think there was only four tables total. There is plenty of seating outside the restaurant though. The server will bring your food out to you. The store and kitchen appeared to be very clean.++++That's always good!!

The food was excellent!! Everything was very fresh and tasted great.

Full order of the Nachos Grande $11.95 - Excellent! We ordered it with the cashew nacho cheese. The full order was enough for two people.

Raw Chili Cheese Fries $11.95 - I did not care for the jicama that is used to replace the potatoes. Everything else tasted great on the dish. I just don't care for the texture of the jicama. They would have been great with real fries. If you like jicama, then you will enjoy the dish.

Mama Mia Lasagna $10.95 - Excellent! The ricotta cheese is replaced with a tofu ricotta. It has the vegan beef and mozzarella, along with fresh spinach in a sun-dried tomato marinara.

Asian Tacos $10.95 - Excellent! The tacos were served with the vegan beef, avocado, cabbage, vermicelli noodles, and sriracha, all wrapped in a tortilla. We ordered it with the field greens on the side.

I will definitely be back to try some more menu items. Give this place a try, even if your not vegan. You will not be disappointed.
The food truck revolution has been sweeping the country. Food trucks are no longer the working man's roach coach that they were once thought to be. Food Truck Friday is a great place to check out a sampling of Charlotte's food truck scene. These trucks are dishing out eats that range from high-class fare to down-home delish. There is something for everyone! 

Come early to avoid the parking woes and crowds. The lines get unbearably long after 6:30pm... Sometimes 60-90 minutes long! Many trucks accept credit (thanks, Square!) but bring cash to be on the safe side. Check out the weekly line up on their Facebook page.
I cant believe I'm the first to review this tattoo studio (I also cant believe its taken me so long to do so.. oops). I got my tattoo here last month by Amy, and I couldn't have been more pleased with my experience, which is a pretty big deal when you're dealing with something as permanent as a tattoo.. not like I can just demand a refund if I'm unhappy. From my very first time there to make my appointment, I was impressed by what I saw and experienced. First and foremost, the studio is clean and organized.. BIG deal. Amy is super cool and friendly, and she literally may be the easiest person to work with. I had to cancel my original appointment and reschedule it for a later time, and she was nothing but understanding and nice about it. They do require a small deposit when you book an appointment, but they're really flexible about it. The day of my appointment, Amy opened the shop early to do my tattoo, which was super cool of her. She took time before hand to perfect my idea and make sure it was exactly what I wanted, and really helped ease my nerves as we stood there and talked.. she's got a great personality!  More importantly though, shes a fantastic artist! My tattoo was simple and quick, but I chose her and her studio because I had seen her work online and was really impressed with her stuff, so I knew that even with something as simple as mine, she'd nail it, and she did. I'm totally inlove with it, and I'd recommend her to anyone, anytime!
I've been buying my dog food here for a long time, ever since that Chinese dog food poison scandal. I buy Ace Hi which is made in the USA and priced right at $21 for 40 pounds. They have lots of other stuff not just stuff for farm animals but pets too. I buy the five and one shots for my dogs also, saves a trip to the vet and a whole bunch of money. Friendly service too!
Try all of the appetizers! Nice staff, gorgeous interior.
A must are the bacon & date wrapped meatballs.
Food was delicious and I'd rate it 4 stars. Service, cleanliness, and ambience only 3 stars. 

There was a "help wanted" sign in the front and they definitely seemed in need of it. This was my first time coming to Fresh Mint so I was eager to hear about our server's favorite dishes. Unfortunately, he wasn't very patient or friendly. Not sure if he was the owner or what but he didn't seem to have enough time to devote to customers and he also seemed to be doing a bunch of jobs at once. People that were ordering takeout seemed frustrated about the wait time. I was also quite surprised they don't offer a kids menu given they are located next door to Modern Milk and across the street from Musicology, which are literally hubs for moms and their kids. I was hoping the server would at least take the time to give some kid friendly recommendations, but he didn't and instead I felt rushed. It was pretty clear they didn't have enough staff to handle everything effectively.

In terms of the ambience, the place wasn't super clean. There was dust behind the serving counter and the soda machine had 3 "out of order" signs out of 6 fountain drinks...not a good look. There was also a mildew crust around the entire fountain drink machine - yuck! The furniture and decor were pretty outdated too.

The food tasted great and I actually would return because it really was good. We ordered the fresh summer roll and fresh cucumber roll -- both were indeed fresh but the cucumber roll was better; the summer roll didn't have much flavor. Both came with peanut dipping sauce which was pretty good. For entrees we ordered their rainbow wonder which came with an abundance of vegetables and the sauce was quite flavorful. Not the biggest portions, especially since it wasn't on the lunch menu, cost $11.95, and I didn't have enough for left overs. My friend ordered the kung pao soy chicken which was very flavorful. It was on the lunch menu so it was offered at a reduced price (I believe around $8) but it also wasn't enough for left overs. 

All in all, the food was great and I'd return for it but hopefully they fix some of the cosmetic and service issues to make it a more pleasurable dining experience overall.
It's a good idea to make a reservation for this place as it gets busy (thanks to the other reviewers for this tip) . We had the fried egg yolk with prawn and pumpkin,  a vermicelli dish, soup and, garoupa belly with tofu, and the app-fried tofu. Everything was a notch up from other chinese restaurants. Our food arrived quickly and was mouth watering. It is definitely worth going back to try a few other dishes. The portions are large and we had 4 people (3 adults, 1 child) and lots of food leftover. They are really busy so don't expect them to be super friendly. I left satisfied and am currently so stuffed!
I received services at both the spa and salon and I must say the spa was amazing! The salon, however, was very subpar. I went in for a partial highlight and blowout. I was assigned to an older man named Gianni who was their "color specialist." My hair is naturally pretty light so when I go for highlights I ask for a low level bleach which I told Gianni. He proceeded to color my hair using a strange board to hold the hair while he was highlighting. The board seemed to keep him from painting the root of the hair and upon completion I realized it looked like I already had a month's regrowth! The highlights were also much lighter and needed to be toned once I returned from my trip. I love the Wynn but this salon seemed more Jersey than an extension of the Steve Wynn branding. I will definitely NOT be returning to the salon.
Good local sushi. Very fresh rolls and best of all at a fair price. The menu itself could use a bit of an update , as well as the speciality rolls. However great lunch deals and for the price good sushi.
They have a lot of supplies and gear, but they act like everyone is just coming in to steal. They have students on the floor just to watch you at every moment and you have to get your bag (handbag\/backpack) searched before you walk in!!? It is sooo weird..
If you like Peruvian cuisine, then this little gem is one you will have to try.  The Ceviche was very good with the seafood very fresh.  The little popcorn and dipping sacues that were provided as accompaniement were wonderfule. The Pisco Sour is as good as I have every had. 

This is a Lima, Peru cuisine, so if you are expecting something that is not from Lima, then you may be disappointed. However, the food was wonderfule in all respects.

I will go back, hopefully many times as this was one nice surprise.
Probably the best customer service I've ever had in Phoenix. The sushi was great too, loved everything we tried!!!!!
I really wanted to like this place but I've had liege waffles and these aren't up to par, especially considering the price. For an $8 waffle, I wanted more. 

Originally, I ordered a strawberry waffle but I was informed they just ran out. It was early afternoon on a weekday. Okay, it happens. My second choice was unavailable as well. I finally just asked him to use whatever fruit they did have so I could get going. 

The best part of a liege waffle are the little pockets of sugar. There were none. The waffle was very tough as well. If you get it with loads of Nutella maybe it's not as noticeable. I'm not into Nutella since I have yet to detect a hint of hazelnut....but I digress. 

This place has potential if they can tweak the waffle recipe and keep basic ingredients in stock. A smaller, less expensive waffle option may be a good idea as well. 

Location in the mall: in between Kay Jewelers and the VS Pink store.
Yup, an update so soon. At this point, I don't know who has trained who. It seems like they don't try to sell upgrades as hard to me which I like and after coming here for years I know how clean my car will be. 

This time, I actually cleaned the interior of the car myself before coming to get it washed. What little that still needed to be vacuumed, I told the guy and yup, sure enough, when I picked up the car, the area that needed to be vacuumed . . . still needed to be vacuumed. Lol. 

And I still come here to get my car washed. What can I write- I think at this point I think Cobblestone is like a comfy pair of shoes to me. Lol.
A decent enough option if you don't want food court food, but don't want to invest the time and\/or money into a cafe or full service restaurant.

The Italian sausage topping on my Margherita base pizza was perfectly cooked, and tasty.  They definitely skimp on the cheese, and the ordering process can be very confusing to new customers and\/or those not used to the fast casual "Chipotle" setup.

The environment inside had some surprisingly classy wood decor on the walls, and was a good step above what many fast casual restaurants have.

Minus stars: Parts of the upper outer crust were too charred, while the bottom middle portion of the crust was still soggy.  One pizza took MUCH longer to arrive.
Absolute fucking disgusting pigs all of these officers deserve the death sentence. Killing innocent people whom are scared for no good reason. Daniel Shaver Look it up. You are worthless pieces of shit who don't deserve to breath we hope your entire department gets butt fucked you worthless excuses for shit. You are all pussies using weapons on an unarmed male, hope you rot in prison you sacks of shit. you are truly the worst smelliest and dumbest pussies that have ever existed. I feel safer around a bottle of pills, alcoholic drinks and bill cosby than I do around any of you goat fuckers killing innocents.

You stupid worthless motherfuckers eat shit.
Joe tint has now tinted both of my cars and now my neighbors. He makes it real easy by coming right to your house or place of business and all for about 1\/2 of most window tinters!
It's was a cute little shop. They were very busy and they handled it very well.  She still took the time to do a great job on my toes.  Plus it was very clean!
It was amusing the first time, the second and third time just doesn't make sense. Food doesn't taste good, everything is either super gigantic big or piled on a mountain of mashed potatoes that most people don't even touch. I think it's cement to hold up the over fried oil glistening meat thing they call sage chicken or pork tenderlion. Flapjacks, tasteless unless you drown it in syrup of course, corn beef hash, dry as the Atacama Desert, really any of the "hash house" are inedible. Let's just highlight the best thing there..Bloody Mary. That's it. Needless to say I drank my food that day at Hash House a Go Go.
I have only eaten here once.  I loved it.  I had a spicy artichoke pasta.  It was a vegetarian dish.  I have been meaning to go back, I love the atmosphere
I can only write a review for the toasted marshmallow flavor - simply delicious! The texture is creamy and the flavor is just perfect! Would highly suggest. I had the smallest size (1\/2 scoop) and was more than satisfied. 

For anyone coming from across the border - definitely have some Canadian $$$ on-hand, they only do 1-1 exchange for US dollars.
Finding a good dentist is hard to find when you move.  I lived outside of Boston for my entire life, prior to moving to Las Vegas, and had the same dentist for as long as I can remember.  When I moved out here  I went through several.  They all seemed to want to "sell" you services over taking care of your needs.  That all stopped once I found Dr. Spelman, whom I have I been a patient for several years now.  

He never suggests that you go through any unnecessary procedures, even when I asked about them, he steered me away with a very honest opinion.

Every person that works in his office at the front desk or the hygienist is wonderful.  They are all super professional and very nice to work with.  

If you are looking for a dentist look no further!!!
Hurts me to do this - I'm sure it was just a fluke but today my fried chicken was legitimately burnt and the wrap to my taco was beyond stale, it was so hard it wouldn't fold. Really disappointing lunch experience.

Who am I kidding though, I'll be back.
Food is Fantastic. When you can get it... Very misleading with the delivery option. 
Their menu states the following:
California Salads
Hours  of  Operation  
Open  from  8:00  a.m.  to  2:30  p.m.  Monday  thru  Friday  
Catering  &  Delivery  Anytime  

Notice that it says anytime for delivery? Yet when you call they tell you they rarely every deliver for just 1 item. The woman that takes your order has some of the coldest phone etiquette ever.
This is PARADISE!
I've been here for a prenatal massage and was delighted with my experience. 
They have a large menu with their services but since I'm pregnant, my options were a little limited - which was fine! This was one of the only spas that had no restrictions as far as how many weeks you can be to receive service. Well, I'm 37weeks so I was a little concerned but when I called to schedule I was told it wouldn't be a problem. 
When I arrived I was rapidly assisted by the lady at the front desk who explained it to me how the spa works and showed me around. I was relieved to learn men and women have their own space.
I was provided with a pair of flip-flops; a locker and a comfy robe.  
They offer you a bath house, a room with 3 different tubs - if you're pregnant they will only advise you to use the one in the middle as it's not too hot and jets aren't too strong.  Clothing is optional, and I was glad since I forgot to bring a bikini, nobody seems to care or to be uncomfortable.
They have towels everywhere, which is pretty convenient.

After spending some time relaxing I decided to snack on something before my massage, so I headed to the cozy waiting room and had some pretzels with iced tea. They offer fruits, juices, water, coffee, among other things.
The staff is very punctual and I was called right on time! I chose the "Mother Nature" massage which was 80 minutes long. It was very relaxing and they have a special pillow to accommodate moms to be so you don't need to worry about the baby bump at all! 

One thing I really enjoyed was that when you buy a service you're more than welcome to spend the whole day there if you want to. You can enjoy the saunas, the tubs, snacks. If you have to leave and want to come back later the same day it's also ok! On top of all they offer, their staff is great, very friendly and attentive. 
I can't wait to go back and totally recommend you to go check it out!
I was taken here for dinner and was simply amazed. My dinner began with a creamy asparagus soup that was awesome with a  side of corn bread. The corn bread wasn't impressive but the soup was. My entree was the vegetable rotini dish and it was amazing! It had multicolored rotini pasta with sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, asparagus, etc. all topped off with a dash of asiago cheese. I liked that the dish did not include a lot of cheese and it came with a side of rosemary bread. Our server was great and the atmosphere is nice and cozy!!!
Definitely a good sandwich, and one of the few places in the area for some quick eats.

To describe the decor as "humble and utilitarian" would be an understatement. But then people come to Vinny's for the sandwiches.

I think vinny's is about on par with California, maybe a little above. I think that they give you a few more peppers with your veal.

The other poster is right about the wait, and if it's busy you can wait 20 minutes for a sandwich. But if you're not in a big hurry, stop in and check them out.
Disappointed. Didn't finish food. Burgers were small and over cooked, ribs were burnt and cole slaw tasted store bought. Fries were only good part but not saying much. Maybe pizza are better choice?
I have worked with both Chris and Mark in not only purchasing from their business, but also selling some of my precious mid century modern family pieces.  They know their stuff, when it comes to Mid Century modern.  They are careful in picking up and delivering, even if it means across the country.  Everything is handled in a personal matter, with great follow up. I have referred family and friends and they are very professional and everyone was so pleased. When I am looking for a particular style or designer, I get the followup call when new items are coming in that would be something I would Love!  Thanks Mid Century Modern\/Mark and Chris
Like many before me, I am trying to be sure to review only the venue itself. I appreciate Gammage for what it brings to the Valley. The arts don't have a huge presence here but this theater brings a little bit of Broadway to the dry, Arizona desert. They typically line up seasons that have something for everybody which makes an evening show now and then almost impossible to resist. 

The building itself is older and does not have an elevator--meaning that anyone who has a physical disability which renders them unable to climb stairs, must buy tickets on the orchestra level. Out of the many shows I have attended here, there have been frequent issues with the sound system...disappointing when you are sitting further than 5 rows from the stage. 

However, being that this is the only stage in AZ that houses big traveling productions, I can't complain too much and will continue to be a patron here. Looking forward to the rest of this season!
This is a great place to be in Vegas, but not have to be in Vegas! 

Huh?

Well, you are on the strip (the north end by Circus Circus), but there is no Casino here, but there are 2 towers of 27+ stories, a concierge, pool, parking garage, marketplace deli, but no on site restaurants. So maybe this isn't your idea of Vegas. 

But if you come here for business, a family vacation, or to stay more than a 3 day girls' or boys' lost weekend in a drunken stupor, this place has a lot of pluses. 

Like no casino, and no restaurants.

Why is that a plus? 

You get tired of having to plan all your meals around a restaurant or room service. It gets expensive for an extended stay. Plus you don't want to wait in line constantly, get dressed to go out in public, or have to constantly tip valets, servers, cab drivers, etc. 

So you get a 1 bedroom suite here, which includes  full kitchen with toaster, mixer, microwave, oven, stove, full size fridge, pots, pans, plates, glasses, utensils, in unit washer\/dryer with complimentary detergent, dining table for 4, dishwasher with complimentary detergent, granite countertops, paper towels, liquid soap and sponge, living room with queen sofa bed, lounge chair and ottoman, dresser, desk\/vanity, 2 40 inch LCDTVs (one in each room), King size bed in the bedroom, with amoire and dresser, oversized jacuzzi bathtub, flagstone like bathroom with double entry ways (bedroom, living room), separate glass enclosed shower, large pool area, common pool\/ping pong table, activity room, larger than normal gym with machines and free weights, deli\/marketplace for casual meals and snack foods, valet or self parking, business center, and VIP lounge. Plus you get Hilton Honors points. 

I got this for $134\/night this trip. Bought some groceries for breakfast and lunch, even some for dinner, and chose when to go to a restaurant or a casino, but could always come back and relax. Free WiFi too, and I didn't have to endure any timeshare pitch. 

Actually, I like the set-up quite a bit. 

So I am in Vegas, without always having to be in Vegas.   

When you come here several times  a year, and you have long passed doing the crazy things like in the movies, this is a good choice. 

PS - they really tried to give good service, too. I received 4 different messages about various things, like a welcome packet, free water bottles as a gold Hilton member, when did I want to schedule housekeeping (because I had the do not disturb sign hanging nearly all day), and the concierge letting me know they can book shows and get discounts. 

The small downsides are that parking is not directly attached, it is about 100 yards away; check out is 10 am, and parking costs $8 self or $13 valet. 

I have stayed at the sister Hilton Grand Vacations on nearby Karen Avenue, too, and this one is bigger, nicer, newer, and better service.

This may not be in the exact heart of the strip, but there isn't a steady stream 10 deep of wide eyed-eyed riff raff holding long neck margaritas yelling and screaming outside your window and flashing pics of everything in site. The lot across the street is empty, but they are building another mega hotel next door. 

Enjoy it while you can.
This was my first experience at a Duck Donuts since my boyfriend made it very clear that we needed to go! A lot of people compare Peace, Love, and Little Donuts to Duck Donuts and I cannot agree with that. Duck Donuts' donuts are full size cake donuts for half the price of PL&LD! I believe a dozen costs around $13, but you're getting super fresh, STILL HOT, donuts, with any glaze, topping, and\/or drizzle you choose at no extra cost! It has never been a long wait, considering they do make all the donuts MTO so expect to wait at least 5 minutes or so. They have water and usually samples of donuts while you wait, so there's nothing to really complain about! Warning-they can be pretty messy, but that's all the fun! Super family friendly and for a great price!

The only problems I had with this location is that it is very small and when you walk through the doors, you walk right into the people that are waiting for their donuts along with anyone in line to order. It can get very cramped. Also, they have little notepads where you can write down your order ahead of time, but people just take the entire notepad to use, so just keep an eye out for that. Lastly, their hours on Sundays are rough, being that they're only open until 2pm! So get out of bed and make sure to get there early!
I haven't had any of the issues with this location that previous reviewers have had. My drinks have consistently been made correctly and they have great customer service. I bring my dog here (thank you drive-thru) and they always fawn over him which makes me a proud puppy parent :) Will return!
Until otherwise Rollin Smoke is King of Las Vegas BBQ.

This is the best example of a small business that through word of mouth has become a smash hit with people everywhere!!! Rollin Smoke has come along way in such a short time, I remember when you could see the chefs in kitchen cooking up a storm from the front counter and the area when you walked in was the only place to sit.

Situated between the strip and the 15 highway, Rollin is on South Highland Dr inside a small strip mall. You will see the smoker and or food truck out front, so be sure to keep your eyes peeled.

The best recommendation for a Rollin Smoke lunch or dinner is: Everything..... From the Ribs to the Brisket and home made deserts, this place won't disappoint you. If your hungry go after the Outlaw Burger... It's one tough burger to get into, and you will be full after.

I will say due to being on a few tv shows recently, the lines might start to increase, so get in early!!!!!

Overall
Price: $$
Drink: 3-5 (soda - no booze)
Food: 5-5
Service: 5-5
Come back: everyday if I could 

Catering:
I'll add In here I had Rollin Smoke come to my house and cater my sons 1st birthday... There wasn't to many kids mostly adults.

The guys were amazing, coming early to setup and checking in on every one to make sure all was good throughout the party. 

Bringing in a smoker to cater the party was also a pretty awesome choice, I'm pretty sure the neighborhood was drooling at the smell. Highly recommend for anyone and everyone... Also a real decent price....

We really enjoyed our lunch at Kroran today! My children and I had the Unnche Lengmen (one for me and one for the boys to share). It was great! My husband had Lengmen, which he said was also very tasty! We are vegetarian and they were happy to accommodate us by leaving the meat out (although they weren't sure it would taste as good!). All in all, a lovely place to try some authentic Uyghur food!
Woah, this place is amazing, killer food, friendly staff, and a warm and welcoming ambiance! I went to fire and brimstone last week and I'm already craving another one of their wood fired pizzas! We got the margarita pizza, daily special pizza and the beet salad. Everything tasted so fresh and all the flavors in the pizza came together perfectly! Also, an added bonus, there is a brewery just 5 steps away from fire and brimstone, so you can enjoy your pizza and beer all in one space! Oh and don't forget to finish your meal with a tasty pizza cookie!
Shut up and take my money. Love Whole Foods so much. Hate the chunk it takes out of my wallet.

Where else can you pick up a pint of craft beer and shop for the greatest organic, local, gluten-free, nut-free finds?
I like MADCAP. This is the type of theater I can see myself in often. I love the vintage, love the vibe, love how I feel when I'm here. I want to go more often. I may actually enjoy going to the movies again, something I really haven't done more than a couple times in probably a decade. 

What makes me sad is that I almost never hear about what is going on there. I wish they had some sort of mailing list that informed me of events because I occasionally wake up in the morning wondering why I haven't been in ages and then it's like.. yeah... because we never talk. Like the friendship you want to keep going and you have a hard time communicating for some reason. Ugh. If they have a mailing list I haven't found it. 

I really want to give MADCAP four stars... come on.. find a good way to promote your events and awesomeness. Make me spend my $$.
Took forever. Went through the drive through and ended up turning off my car after waiting for 7 minutes for one person ahead of me to get their food. Then waited another 9 minutes to get mine....horrible service. Ok food.
Goat Meat, Elk Meat, Buffalo Burger... you can find exotics here. The store is kept clean (no bad smell), and the customer service was excellent. Will return :)
This was one of the most below average meals i have had.  The onion rings werent fully cooked so eating raw batter isnt pleasant. 

The burger was average from what my friend said but the salmon scalopini sandwich was not very good either.

Too many good options in vegas to eat here.
Owner operated family restaurant in Fort Mill makes this a great choice for breakfast. Generous portions, friendly staff and reasonable prices makes FMFR a great choice! Try the breakfast special, you won't be disappointed.......
I have Been sitting here over a half an hours while the lane next to me has went through 2 cars already. I am frustrated  and can't leave because the employees have already put a car behind me. 

I am editing my review because the district manager was there, apologized and offered a free oil change for my trouble. I do have to say that he turned my experience around.
I highly recommend TLC flooring.  We are re-flooring the tile floor throughout the house.  We visited MANY tile stores in the valley - the fancy ones, flooring specialty stores, and big box stores.  When we found TLC Flooring on Hacienda, we knew that we found the best tile, a favorable price\/value, and the right store to work with.  Ramin was\/is exceptionally helpful to work with.   He assisted with tile selection (amazing options), color guidance, and  additional detail accents that really made our home project stand out as a lovely improvement.  

We had our own installers, who found TLC easy to work with.  We also used TLC for supplies (thinset and grout) - all good quality, good selection, and easy to coordinate.  

We will continue to use TLC for our next projects including decorative tile areas, carpets, custom area rugs, and more.  

The product selection was perfect, their assistance was extremely valuable, their service was top notch, and they are friendly as well.  

If you are doing a flooring project, do yourself a favor and stop by TLC flooring on Hacienda.
I ended up here for something sweet since the ice cream shop next door was closed for the night.

I ordered the "Not Your Grandmother's Hot Chocolate."  It had a nice spicy kick from the pepper they use, ranking it a notch above your usual cinnamon Mexican hot chocolate.

Minus one star for adding whipped cream when I deliberately told them to add none.  Was too tired to complain.
I was oh so fortunate to be invited for this event as a plus one!
Indeed, we sauntered around while sipping on the lovely cocktails provided and nibbled on the appetizers.  We took a number of pictures, clearly not all are posted;). How could one resist!  The gentlemen bringing out the delicious offerings by Pink Taco were simply enganging.  Magic Mike & Pink Taco under the same roof- THINK ABOUT IT ;)  This combination alone can only equal an epic night: perhaps of all sorts of debauchery, tsunami of sexyness!  
I have a great appreciation and thank you for Yelp, Taylor & the wonderful Elizabeth (I was her plus one) for this event.  I've had numerous friends from back home, yes indeed male & female inquiring about the Magic Mike show.  I can now report back that it's time they book those flights and we see this Magic Mike troupe;). Yes, a friend has planned to come into town and I will be seeing MM round 2.  
The cherry on top of the show was inevitably the MC.  Listen, she can ride a unicorn, along with charming the crowd with antedotes we all know so well:)
Be mindful that you may get wet!  No, come on now...  I mean if you happen to be seated front row during the performance with the use of water- THAT'S how you may get wet.  I'm not divulging any additional tidbits of the Magic Mike show!
I got a good deal on this room. I'm not sure how I ended up with a suite but I'm not complaining.  We walked into the room really shocked. Only because we weren't  expecting a suite. It was really nice! Not too shabby for the price.  Our room was clean and our view was really nice. It reminded me of a 1 bedroom apartment. Big and spacious! We had 1 1\/2 bathrooms which is something I'm not use to. The only thing I didn't like was how weak the toilets flush! You have to hold it down. They lock the balcony for safety reasons which was a bummer. Caution on opening the mini bar!!! I opened  it too fast and all of the drinks fell out! Thankfully before checking out the staff was great with taking all of it off on my bill. I had a good first experience here and would definitely come back!
Yesterday I had breakfast here with a friend, and really enjoyed the experience.  The restaurant itself has a very rustic feel - not very Las Vegas; think more along the lines of Colorado or even somewhere in the Midwest.  Very cool if you're looking for a place that isn't going to be full of tourists, or alcohol.  (Again, very non-Vegas.)  But that's part of its draw.

We went during off hours, so that's probably why it was mostly empty when we went.  We had a courteous server who checked on us often, making sure we had everything we needed and wanted.  And the food - ahhhh, the food.  I got the harvest pancakes with strawberries on top.  Wow.  So good!

The only thing keeping this place from a five-star rating - at least for me - is that there weren't many vegetarian options.  That being said, those pancakes are worth coming back for!  I'll be back here again.
yes this is in a mall, but it is by no means food court fare.  Kona has great sushi, salads, and entrees.  They have a hoppin happy hour as well.  I would recommend the teriyaki salmon salad and the Las Vegas Roll.
Everyone was really nice. The scan tech was very friendly and the whole process was very quick. Got there at 930 for a 10a appointment and was out by 10a. I was also a new patient so they were very efficient.
How do I love thee, Brew Lab? Let me count the ways. I'm told you're super coffee heroes, to those that are qualified to discuss such matters. Well, here's a star for being great at everything non-coffee AS WELL. Yes, your hot chocolates are divine. Your tea selection includes my new favourite, lavender rooibos.

Here's a star for the fact you sold me a plum. An actual plum. A 50p plum. Your fruit bowl is more than just apples and bananas, for you sold me a plum.

Here's a star for recognising me when I come in and for being so welcoming every single time.

Here's a star for your excellent and reliable free Wifi, and even for your smart idea to switch it off at lunchtimes, which, while it might inconvenience folks like me, is actually a really clever plan because you know you're hot enough to get business at that time simply on the basis of your own product.

Here's a star for your decor, or lack of. Even when your front window got spidered by some blunt object recently, and I felt my heart form similar patterns at the brutal attack on a place that is now, essentially, a piece of my soul, you somehow owned it. Your exposed bricks and mortar, your unfinished corners, your ramps and slopes on the wooden floor - all is perfection, kooky and raw without being too hipsterish.

Here's a st- oh wait, I hit five already. Well, good job, Brew Lab, good job. Good job from someone who doesn't even come here for the thing you specialise in. You are superheroes indeed.
Why did this have to suck so much?  The sign. . . have you seen the sign?  It's AWESOME!  I wanted to be able to judge this book by its cover.  I could not.

Guests from out of town wanted to experience a restaurant with local flair.  What better way to do that than visit a place where even the spelling of the name smacks of Pittsburgh?  Turns out. . . lots of better ways.  

First, let me start on a good note.  There are really awesome things about this restaurant.  These things, while not awesome enough to slide the scale from a two star review to a three or four, ironically made our evening less memorable.  Ironic, because if everything about this restaurant had sucked, at least we all would have looked back on that indelible memory and said, "This restaurant experience was the worst in my life."  But it wasn't.  The sign is great.  The decor is cool.  The location is fantastic.  The food is actually really good too.

But the service was awful.  Amateurish.  WHY would you pay for this location and go through the trouble of making really good food, only to have your wait staff stumble and blunder through every meal to the point where it eclipses the experience and THEN some.

Some low-lights: 

No greeter at the door.  The bartender told us she'd be right back.  We waited about five minutes before she showed up.  We had reservations, but the place was half empty.  

Despite being half empty, we were shown to a table RIGHT next to another full table.  I don't like eating on top of other people.  We asked to move.

No water with dinner, unless asked.  Specialty drink came with basil in it (the selling feature for my sister-in-law, who thought it sounded kind of neat). . . the drink arrived without it.  When she inquired she was told they were out of basil.  

The wine order was botched twice.  The drinks came slow.  Verrry slow.  We quipped that perhaps it was because the place was so busy, but at the point we were placing our order, the half of the restaurant that was full emptied out for what I assume was a show, and we occupied one of perhaps three tables in the place.  Nevertheless. . . slow.

At the end of the meal I remarked upon how great the sauce with my pasta was.  I lamented the lack of bread on the table.  We inquired. . . they had it all prepared, just never brought it.  The bread was AWESOME.  Sooo simple to put the bread on the table.  

The waitress was very friendly. . . just. . . clueless.  It's like they spend a million (or whatever) on a restaurant start-up then ran out of money and had to hire relatives to work strictly for tips.  

The two star rating for yelp says, "meh.  I've experienced better."  And I have.  All over downtown Pittsburgh.  As I was telling my wife before we left, I really liked the food there, but I really like the food a lot of other places too.  There's no reason for me to go back there when I can get food I like just as much somewhere that pays for competent waitstaff.
I am almost indifferent to this place.  Here is why...

Pros:  This is the neighborhood grocery store for Mt. Washington.  For that reason alone, I think I like the fact that there is a grocery store in Mt. Washington.  For me, it is within walking distance for basics and staples and does stock fresh produce.  In addition, I am aware of some level of "investment" in the building itself so the appearance is nice.

Cons:  I have shopped here twice.  Since Foodland doesn't dominate the grocery "market" in Pittsburgh, I do think their prices are a little high.  The two times I was there I was looking for a particular item.  The first was a can opener.  They sell them, but it was not in stock.  That was frustrating.  I've heard this complaint about this store other times, too.  The second trip I was looking for very particular items: hummus and pita.  Now, I realize hummus is not a total staple in the American (aka Western PA) diet, but I would have thought there'd be some demand considering the economic make-up of the Mount.  They had hummus.  Yes.  But after not being able to find it, asking a clerk, and searching, I found only one type of hummus.  The next item, pita, was also in a very bizarre place and I almost had to settle on pita chips (which they had a ton of) before two clerks located the last of the fresh pita.

In all, I will fully support the Foodland in Mt. Washington and re-review after they make some changes.  Until then, I will be forced to use it only for staples which is a shame.  The staff working there are very helpful, despite the stocking and layout issues it seems to have.

UPDATE: I changed from a 3-star to a 1-star because I recently went in, asked an employee for help, and he looked at me and told me to ask someone else working.  Milk only from now on.
MGM Resorts International owns a dozen huge properties in Las Vegas:

Aria, Circus Circus, Luxor, MGM Grand, Monte Carlo, Signature, Four Seasons, Bellagio, Excalibur, Mandalay Bay, Mirage, New York New York, Vdara, and the Mandarin. 13 if you count THE Hotel (really part of Mandalay) separately, like they sometimes do. Then 14 if you count CityCenter, and 15 for CityCenter Residences (timeshares) but then back to 14 because I think they don't own the Mandarin anymore. 

Anyway, a huge corporation, owning half the Strip or more. Their M-Life frequent spender card is good at all the proporties to build freebee points. 

5 of their properties are linked together on the south end of the Strip, and 3 are prominent: Excalibur, Luxor and Mandalay Bay. These 3 are connected by a free tram system between them. There are also connective walkways between the three.  

Where Excalibue is more of a family place, and Mandalay Bay is a higher end, more sophsticated place, the Luxor can be described as a place for the youth set. They have exhibits like The Human Body on the mezzanine, and the sophmoric comedy of Carrot Top. 

The nightclub, lacking creative naming capabilities, or seeking a particular Westchester district of Los Angeles crowd, is called LAX. 

And in the casino, they play loud club music all over, so it is hard to hear the numbers called on the Craps table. And most of your fellow players are noobs on the gaming tables, not knowing the rules or the bets.

The rooms are average hotel rooms. The most unusual thing is of course the Pyramid Shape, the huge light beam shining into the dark nigth from the top of it, and the diagonally moving elevators. It is a clever idea, until you get inside one drunk and try to stand upright as it moves sort of sideways. 

The Egyption  themed decor great outside with the Sphinx and Obelisk, but indoors it is drab, like being inside a dustry tomb in some places (like the buffet room). The pool has a huge waterfall contraption in the middle, but you can't use it for a slide, just a small waterfall. 

So if this is your first time to Vegas, and if you are in the 21-29 age group, this isn't a bad choice. They offer cheap deals on rooms, and I got a special show rate of about $60, and in the past got internet deals under $100 a night even on a weekend. But no bath, only a shower in the Pyramid rooms. You are probably better off room wise, in the separate tower.
burgers are very big portions here.

definitely order the onion ring tower to share...

Milkshakes are tasty! My personal favourite - the vanilla one.
Won the award for Pittsburgh's best fish sandwich.  It's enormous.  Two fish sandwiches, really, which kind of makes it not fair, since all the other fish sandwich places must have only really been competing with half the fish of this place.

Great beer selection and the prices. . . let's just say you know you're not in the Pittsburgh city limits when you buy five craft beers and your bar tab ends up not cracking the $30 barrier.

Good wings, and huge burgers.
Delicious vegetarian new resto in town. Everything in the menu sounded deliscous and what we ordered didn't upset. Definitely recommend this place... oh and the ambience is amazing too
McDonald's is McDonald's there's  nothing really special to say. Quick cheap food with a tolerable customer service. What's not to love?
Normally, the cost for this tour is $42, there was a groupon for $25- the tour sounded interesting so a group of us bought the groupon.

We throughly enjoyed the tour and thought Annie Harris, a budding entrepreneur, did a funlicious and foodlicious job of organizing and leading the tour.

Annie hails from Santa Fe where walking tours were aplenty and when she moved to Scottsdale, she couldn't believe no such tours existed here.  Well, she didn't wait around for one to happen- she made it happen.

The tour is well organized.  Once you book the tour, she sends you a confirmation email with the meeting place and the best places for parking.  You show up, she hands you a bottle of water and a map of the walk tour that you will be taking.

We went to six different places:  The Rusty Spur, Outrageous Olive Oils and Vinegars, Su Vino Winery, Frank & Lupe's, Cowboy Ciao, and the Sugar Bowl.  

At each restaurant, there were no delays in getting our sample since they were anticipating our arrival.  And I must say, the food\/samples served were a good size and plenty tummy rubbing good!

Out of the 6 spots, 3 of the spots were new to me so I was glad to go there.  I esp. enjoyed the Rusty Spur, the Outrageous Olive Oils and Vinegars and plan on booking a party at the Su Vino Winery.

Annie takes us on a good, walking route with tibits of history between the restaurants~ I learned things about Scottsdale I didn't know before and I've been living here for over 10 years!

The only thing lacking was one of my friends did not eat beef or pork and all three restaurants (The Rusty Spur, Frank & Lupe's, and Cowboy Ciao) served either beef or pork so I wished there was a chicken option for my friend's sake and for others in the same position.

Would I pay $42 instead of the $25~ absolutely!  It was that enjoyable.
Love this place. Excellent food, great crew, great atmosphere, chicken and waffles in Charlotte. May they never close.
I discovered this location when I was craving comfort food. I no longer live with my parents and sometimes I miss home cooked Filipino meals. It's good to still get a taste of home, away from home.  

This little gem is located on the corner of Jones and Robindale. The inside was fairly small so it did have that "turo turo" feeling to it which was really comforting. I really liked the place because of that. There was a wait time which was expected in a Filipino restaurant. It was still not as bad as the wait time in DT's. Our server went from one table to another informing everyone why there was a delay or what caused the delay.  We truly appreciated their efforts in keeping their customers informed.

When our food came, we ravished it right away. We ordered the Balikbayan Box and the Kanto Box. It used to be a lunch special they now offer it for dinner. The lechon kawali that came with my Kanto Box was really one of the best I've had. The pork was crispy on the outside but the meat remained moist and juicy. Everything that came with it was pretty decent. I also ordered the Aligue fried rice. I have not had those since I was in college in the Philippines and man, it was so good! The portion was big enough for two people but I felt like I could finish the whole thing by myself! 

Also a few things you need to know, they do not offer fountain drinks here. And, even though there's a wait service, you are expected to go up to the counter to pay after your meal. Still, I would definitely come back to get me some more of those Aligue fried rice! Writing about it now made me so hungry about it already!

Went back here last night with the whole family (There's 9 people total) and Tina personally took care of us. She was very sweet and was on top of everything. Thank you for the great service and as always, the awesome food.
I am officially becoming a Roaming Fork Groupie, which can't be good for my waistline. Every Thursday I make it a point to visit for lunch. A couple of things have changed, so it's a good time for an update.

Since my initial visits, I've tried more dishes. The fried deviled eggs are good, but they really need the mustard sauce with each bite to add some tang. I've also had a chance to try the pamesan herbed fries, which were crispy and hot. The parmesan added just the right amount of flavor and salt. 

Finally, I've had a chance to try the famous blackened fish tacos. Here's the thing: I'm not a huge fish taco fan. Everyone raved about them, so I tried them, and I recognize that they are an excellent version of a fish taco... But that's not my favorite kind of food. If you like fish tacos, you'll almost certainly love these.

What IS my kind of food? Well, the grilled cheese, as my previous review made clear. The past few visits, they've started offering the option of pulled pork on the grilled cheese. Oh. My. God. They took my two favorite sandwiches, and combined them into one. I think about that pulled pork grilled cheese - a lot. Usually when I'm eating a salad. Their grilled cheese sandwiches will keep me coming back for more, for a long time. Particularly if they keep offering pork with them!

The last two trips out to Ballantyne, I've also noticed that they have an "expediter" managing orders at the window. Last week, she wasn't wearing a Roaming Fork t-shirt, and people thought she was waiting in line. This week there was a really engaged woman in a RF t-shirt greeting everyone who showed up right away. She did a great job, and I think the addition of someone to manage the orders on the front end, while they work on getting them put together inside the truck is a great one.

There will be many more visits from me! All of the food is great, the people are so nice, seek them out and you won't be disappointed!
Stopped by for a quick dinner before another event downtown. Walked in at 5:40 pm and the podium up front said, "Seat Yourself Please". There were 4 of us including one teenager. After we sat on the outside patio, a young waitress came to us and seemed appalled. "Did the hostess seat you?"  "No, we seated ourself per the sign". She continued that they don't allow children after 6 pm (20 minutes from our entry time) even though we never saw any posting of the sort or could even figure out why they wouldn't let kids in to eat there, even after 6. We ordered after we convinced the waitress that we would be quick because of a later commitment. Dinner was, fine, nothing special. Fresh but didn't blow me away. At about 6:15 as the waitress brought the check, she tells me, "I spoke to the manager, and it's ok."  OK? Ok for what? We were done. Was she angling for a bigger tip because she "allowed" us to skirt this ridiculous, non posted, possibly made up policy? There are a lot of cool little places popping up downtown. Based on other reviews I've read here on Yelp for Park On Fremont, I think that some customer service techniques should be shared with the staff, if anyone there has the skills or cares to share them. I would not recommend this place to anyone I know or any customer that I may have in my limousine when asked for places to eat downtown. I think you have a cool place, I hope you care enough to address the issues you obviously have there.
It took a really long time to get seated but maybe it's because we were in a huge group. 

The food was decent, good appetizers and desserts. I wasn't too impressed with the burger to be honest, it was alright, it didn't taste like it should cost $25, but then again it's Vegas. The food took forever to come out but I think it's because it all came out at once for a huge group.
Another favorite happy hour place!  They have good deals on beer and a couple food items.  I used to get the twisted breadsticks, but for some reason they took them off the menu.  Don't worry, if you ask for them, they'll make 'em.  :)

Service is great here....attentive and quick for how busy it usually is around 5pm.  Oh yes, and single ladies should definitely be here for happy hour - lots of men!  Probably married men let out for a few hours on a weekend....but men nonetheless!  And for the fellas, there are a lot of good looking waitresses....very cute.
Fieldwork Phoenix is a great way to voice your opinion, try out new product, and earn some extra bucks!  

It's easy.  You sign up online and then from time to time you'll receive short questionnaires via email to determine if you qualify for one of their studies.  

Last week, I finally qualified!  It was a fitness study that required some homework, like documenting what I eat before\/after\/during a workout.  The night of the actual study, I showed up 20 minutes early (early bird drawing for $50!) to check in and fill out paperwork.   Then, the group of us were taken into a conference room where we discussed a new product (sorry, it's confidential!) and our thoughts on design and marketing.  Two hours later, it was over.  Painless!

Pay and time depends on the study, but for this particular one it paid $125 for two hours.  Not bad!

Every employee I've come in contact with, either in person or over the phone, has been friendly and able to answer all my questions.  If you're looking to make some extra money in an easy and fun way, sign up!
This restaurant takes over the ol' Burger 21 place that occupied the venue for about 6 months to a year.  The signs for burgers shakes and fries on the bright red awnings are painted over with black. 

The interior is definitely malt shop chic, an asian fusion restaurant possessing the body of a burger joint, still, they make it work...the shake counter is now a sushi bar.  

There are some growing pains it would seem.  When I walked in it took what felt like an awkwardly long time for the young man behind the register to glance up at me from what he was working on (phone?).  It may have only been 30 seconds, but when you're standing in front of someone who doesn't look up, it seems like forever.  

The place was relatively empty.  The booths lining the walls were filled but the interior tables were vacant.  He surprised me when he seated me by saying he wanted to place me at a table by the window so he wouldn't forget about me.  

He gave me the menu...and then appeared to forget about me.  

I overheard him telling nearly every customer thank you for your patience, but it honestly didn't take long once I'd placed my order to get my food.  

They must have been short staffed, he returned to tell me that the sushi chef was helping in the kitchen so it would be a few more minutes until I got my Arizona rolls, but my shrimp pad thai arrived relatively quickly.  

They brought my sushi out...but it was someone else's.  They then brought the right order and it was delicious.

So ultimately...the pad thai was good.  The sushi rolls were good.  They did that thing that I hate where they left the tails on the shrimp so I had to pick them up with  my fingers to remove the tails, but I couldn't tell if it was on purpose.  There were probably six or so shrimp and maybe three of them had tails on and three did not.  So either they're inconsistent in their preparation, or they leave the tails on...either way, room for improvement.  The taste of all of my food was really good.  

When I got up to pay my bill the server again apologized for the wait and thanked me for my patience, noting that...as I could see...everyone came all at once.  But...it was still just as half full as it had been when I showed up.  

Whatever the reason for the apologies and waits and incorrect orders, they were all minor issues.  The food was good.  The price was reasonable.  The "wait" was not long.  I think maybe just a little inexperience on the part of the staff and possibly a no-show in the kitchen.  No reason to turn you away from trying them out.  

I would definitely go back for a casual lunch or dinner.  Not really a date-worthy place, but a good work lunch atmosphere.
I'm not really sure what I think of this place. I don't live anywhere near here and try to stay out of Tempe as much as I can. But it's kinda become a ritual to come here before a show at the Marquee.  Mostly because we can hit up happy hour, and get a quick bite and drink many beers before they go up to $10 at the show.  But as big as this place is, it's always dead.  The food isn't anything spectacular but it does the job.  I just like how there seems to always be some kind of drink special and we can get in and get out.
This place is located in a strip mall on Durango just North of Flamingo. When you walk in you notice right away all the memorabilia on the walls from Chicago.

The food was okay. I had the Italian beef sandwich. It was definitely not made like Al's Italian Beef in Chicago.
Hi. My name is Omar and I am an addict. I'm addicted to Venenzia's Pizza. No, I don't want help to fix my problem. I just can't get enough of this pizza!!!
I've ordered large lunches here twice. My team and I love 
the ITALIAN STALLION, BBQ CHICKEN, MEAT LOVER, SPICY HAWAIIAN PIZZA, MARGHERITA, SUPREME and my fav:  THE PARK AVENUE. It has artichoke hearts, spinach, garlic, tomato and grilled chicken.  
OMG! Freakin Awesome.  Disclaimer: It's a little wet so expect some funky sounds eating it. 
You can't eat one slice.  Really.  You can't. 
I am never disappointed.  My doctor is though...at my lack of self control...then i remind him I'm addicted...it's all good.
Ordered 4 sandwiches, chips and a pickle; order came to be about $50. Soooo disappointed. Our sandwiches were mostly lettuce. I ordered a #4, a turkey tom. I got 2 slices of what I think was turkey and 1\/2 pound of lettuce. The other sandwiches we ordered were made the same way. $50 for iceberg and bread?! I don't think so....Never again.
Consistently good, The Coffee Cup never disappoints.  Every time we go I get a Bloody Mary and one of their freshly baked cinnamon rolls.  The biscuits and country gravy are amazing as are the hash browns.  The staff here is friendly and the couple who own the place are always there.  I love the surf decor and the homage they give to the Armed Services.  Well worth the traffic if you are visiting, eat a great meal and go see the Damn!
I had a great experience with Steve yesterday. Having had multiple bad experiences at dentists i was greatly surprised at how incredible this place is.Steve is a very careful, thorough and caring person.Here they have thought of everything to put you at ease from the home like ambiance to the comfortable chairs and even a fluffy blanket!
This morning i can see a great difference in my teeth. There was sensitivity through the day yesterday but just as steve explained - this would go away with time.
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend friends and family. I know they will be in excellent hands.
Great location for pre show. Nice vibe. Fine drink menu. Maybe the worst hamburger I have ever had in my life. Barely ate half.
First time here today.  I brought my husband who is extremely picky. I was worried about his reaction to trying something new. He got a bacon, sausage, egg and cheese sandwich that he was thoroughly impressed with. I got the bacon, egg and cheese on some bread I hadn't heard of. It was so good I wish it wouldn't have ended. Since we didn't eat there we stood and waited for out food and coffee. We decided to buy some of the chocolates. Since I am currently full I will have to update after chocolate consumption.  It is a quaint little shop with some amazing greeting cards and a lot of eye candy on the walls. If you are in the neighborhood stop by and try it.
Ok so I'm from out of town and needed my car washed desperately. Found this place locally and uuuggg...$10 for an exterior wash and they don't even wipe the car down afterwards!! Will never go back! I asked the guy are they gonna at least wipe the car down, he said oh no we only do that at our other location! Ummmm u won't be seeing me here again!
This is for the paint ball review. 

I saw the deal on groupon and decided to go for it. We paid 104 bucks for 4 people and each of us got 250 paints, which lasted about 2 hours. You may think "only two hours ?" But it is very intense and you will get very tired by the time you ran out of your paint. The people there were very friendly and accommodating. This place is perfect for teenagers as well as adults. Women receives free chest guards. I do recommend wearing neck guard.
Not alot of food selection when i go especially during breakfast hours. Very pricey and such a shame the food is a 0
Date & Time: Sunday, 1\/18\/15 @ 9pm

This was my first time trying snow ice like this. It was so delicious ! I told the lady it was my first time there, and she was super nice and helpful ! I wish I had gotten her name :(

anyways, I purchased a small (the smallest size the offered, cause I had just eaten at monta). They had cookie butter flavor (OMG ! life has been made at this point), and she told me I can select a topping and a sauce, so I opt for condensed milk (I believe) and mochi pieces. The cost was around $5

You really can't go wrong with this place, it's very tasty and something different. The flavor is not super sweet but really creamy. If you love fro-yo, you need to come here. This is in it's own category of cold desserts.
The yogurt quality is fine but it's a hit and miss on variety given how many machines they have running. The reason I'm giving them 3 stars is the recent decline in topping variety they've been offering. They don't replace toppings once they run out so you're confronted with upsettingly empty bins where peanut butter cups used to be. They've also reduced their fruit options by a lot so I can't kid myself about being healthy. 

The service is lovely and I like their seating area but it's a coin-toss regarding the actual product because some days they're properly stocked and other days it's a disappointment.
POOR service. According to hours on Yelp the business was supposed to be open but when I called I was told they were closed. He offered to meet me though so I waited at his business for him to arrive. Apparently he thought I was supposed to meet him at Walgreen's, however I thought we were meeting at his business and we both sat at different locations waiting on one another. There was a miscommunication and the guy called me back frustrated I didn't show up to  Walgreen's. He called me an a** hole so I hung up. I try to support local small business but not when I'm called an a** hole over a simple miscommunication.
First timer. Buttercream was excellent, but cake was dry on both cakes we purchased. We ate them just a few hours after purchase. Will try again.
Sooo... Pretty much one of the most fantastic places in fitchburg and I love it. Bacon Pancakes? Umm yes please. They have every type of breakfast food under the sun. Omlets and Pancakes, to Crepes O Chocolat. You can build your own or get something standard. It's in kind of in a hidden area so you gotta know where it is. Furthermore this place does get pretty busy for sunday brunch or brunch in general. The staff is SUPER fast (if your there at a good time and not when church lets out) and everyone just seems to have a blast when they're there. I love this little hidden Gem and everyone should go and enjoy it!
If you're looking for that divey, smokey experience, then this is your place!

The food was pretty good and the service wasn't bad, but the inside is so small and cramped.. it really seems to me that this was just meant to be a small local hang out and it turned into something more than they planned- which is not a bad thing, by any means! However, there's that part about it being small and cramped that kind of goes a long with that. And again, they do allow smoking so be aware of that if you're sensitive to smoke. Because it is so small and there are so many people, it can get over whelming. Also, almost every employee working was seen smoking, including the kitchen staff. Now, they smoked in the dining room before they'd walk back to the kitchen.. but yikes. If the smell didn't bother me, that sort of did......

Truthfully, there's not much to say. I thought the food was good, so if that's your priority I'd say give it try. I can't say we'll go back, but not necessarily because of anything they did or didn't do.. it's just not a place that will stick out in our memories as being a go-to. 

Also, if you check in on yelp they offer you a small discount.. although they never gave me mine.. it's only like 10% or something so I didn't press it, but still!
I slept 4 hours this weekend. 3 of them here. ;)

Good for sleeping.
No fridge in the room.
Nice pool and river thing - but to rent a donut its $14
Spa facilites use is only $22, book way ahead for treatments - there is a 2 for 1 coupon.

Good for sleeping. Cant type anymore.... ZZzzzzZZZ
Click Post It. Wait. I'm still typing. My head hurts.
Great tea selections, fresh food and great atmosphere. I had a bowl of split pea soup which was not too thick or thin. Priced just right, and service was excellent as well. Definitely repeat.
We live across the street from Mabel's and are frequent shoppers there. It is a fantastic neighborhood spot and a great place to drop in on a Saturday or Sunday morning when you're walking the dog.

Our favourites include: croissants, almond croissants, sourdough bread, any of the cookies, the carrot cake, the empanadas (Veg or Meat), and the roast beef arugala & horseradish sandwich on a pretzel bun. Every item is made with care and the best ingredients. Also they brew a mean cup of coffee.

They are not getting 5\/5 stars from me because the prices are a touch high (although I respect the business and the quality of ingredients they are paying for), and MOSTly because my husband adores the almond croissants - The Grid (RIP) even did a write up on them - and they never have them anymore. Inventory management issue I suppose.

Anyways if you haven't been, GO. Awesome spot to grab a dessert if you're having a dinner party too - pies, cakes, squares etc. are perfection.
Local outdoor store with a small selection of clothes and gear. The selection for rock climbing gear was very limited. The store was clean and well organized. Prices were on par with MSRP. So, why two stars? Well, I don't particularly care for being followed around by employees as I peruse the store. I'll take my business elsewhere.
I will start with the service was excellent. We had a new waitress who was training,  and she was still great at it. 

As for the food. My group ordered the irish nachos. They were yummy,  but the topping to chip ratio was off  they need to layer some cheese lower, cause the one they use hardens fast, so it's hard to get a bit on each chip. The amount of corn beef could have been slightly more, but it tasted great.

My irish breakfast however was a mess. My eggs were burnt, I ordered them sunny side up, and the yolks while runny, we're starting to get that white film over them from being cooked to long, the bottoms were brown and the edges were brown and crispy, I mean this was something that was so obviously wrong. The bangers (sausage) were a bit to vinegary for my taste, and again one was a bit burnt. The tomato was only a few slices and they were super over seasoned,  all I tasted was a super spicy tomato, they need to hold off on that a lot!. The white and black puddings were tasty. Their rashers also had a burnt taste to them and they were super tough. They look like they had been cooked over a grill,  it made them taste almost exclusively of charcoal.  The roasted potatoes... well they turned out to be french fries (super disappointing)  and the irish soda bread had had a great flavor but was also super dense.
This is a good sized sports bar\/ale house.  It is located near the southern end of the shopping center.

We were sat right away and the staff seemed friendly.  Our server, however, was clearly overwhelmed.  We had to request drinks multiple times in a few instances to get what we ordered.  There was only one beer menu available.  Not a deal breaker, but quite inconvenient.

I ate some off of two appetizers for my meal.  The quesadilla was OK.  Not bad, but nothing special either.  It is a decent portion as an appetizer.  It would best best for splitting between two or three people .  I also tried the Ale House Loaded Fries.  They were ok.  The portion is large, but I thought they were a little bland.
Walked in, no greeter wasn't sure if restaurant was open for service. Looked down to the bar, waitress was busy socializing with the bartender. Ordered the 3 roll lunch special. Spicy salmon, spicy yellowtail, yellowtail w scallion. Spicy salmon, spicy yellowtail came, not spicy. Made with tempura crunch mixed in. What!?!
Saving grace, I reordered and got another roll of yellowtail w scallion and tuna with avacado. Tuna does not look fresh. 
Waitress forgot to bring soup and salad. Soup was barely warm.  Salad dressing choices were ranch or thousand island ??? 
The owner spent a lot of money redoing the interior. I hope the service and the food improves to make this place successful.
Frequent visitor of this location. Usually a little bit of a line but manageable. They have a pretty good selection, not that I stray that much. 

Their coffee is pretty good, I like that I can refill it at my leisure. Like all Einsteins they put A LOT of cream cheese on the bagels, but its easy to spread off to your liking.
This was one of two hotels I always dreamed of staying at since my first visit to Vegas in '01.  I wished it lived up to expectations.  We stayed in early July '15.  Not what I would consider the best value for the money on the strip.

Unfortunately, we stayed for two nights and had issues both nights with the room that prevented a sound sleep.  The first night our smoke detector started beeping (due to low battery) around 4:50am in the morning; maintenance promptly came up and fixed it after a call to the front desk.  The second night, our a\/c unit started making a squeaking sound around 5am, but we were too tired to get dressed to have maintenance come for an indeterminate amount of time to to fix it and there was no way we felt like packing up and switching rooms.

We did mention these issues upon checkout and after some insistance, we were compensated what we asked for, so I feel customer service was good.  However, for the price we were charged per night, I feel these things should not have happened.

Oh, and we had splurged for the 'strip view', but what we got was a view of the airport and the Excalibur, and Mandalay Bay, which are at the far end of the strip.  Not worth requesting a strip view, IMO.  Also, because it's so far down on the strip, it's not convenient to everything.

BUT...it IS convenient if the UFC is at the MGM Grand and\/or the Mandalay Bay,  We stayed here for UFC 189.
I know I am may be in the minority on this topic but I hate live music at bars and pubs.  It is always far too loud.  It is especially bad when it is a band attempting to be Irish singing songs from all genres.  I would have moved on, but others in the group were starving and could not wait to find a new place.

The bar its self is a decent place.  There are a few different seating areas.  The hostess did do her best to seat us as far away from the music as possible.

The food is ok.  I ordered the chipper chips with cheese and bacon.  They come with a malt vinegar mayo, which is a nice touch.  The chips are large steak fries.  They are covered in a decent amount of cheese and bacon.

The service is ok.  The staff is generally friendly.  I am not sure if they are made to force an Irish accent, but it does not work for some of them.
beautiful facilities, friendly staff and great pricing on spectacular vehicles!!! Definitely reccommend going to see them !
Meh truly is the best rating for my experience at Pasta Brioni. 

I ended up there on the last day of Yelp Eats with a group of friends in a craving for Italian. From what I saw on their menu, I was very excited to see what was i store for me and had heard pretty decent things. I walked out not that excited. 

The ambiance inside is very nice, though a bit on the dark side. The decor inside told a completely different story than what I was thinking when I saw the entrance. It is very posh inside and I did like the comfy booths.

We arrived early enough to get the early bird special, which appeared to be a better deal than the yelp eats one. I wonder if this was truly our best choice. 

For me when it comes to pasta, I am a bit picky. This mainly comes from the fact that I don't like really heavy sauces and I really do not like tomatoes. It has to be a good Italian place and not your run of the mill to get me excited.

My first course was a Caesar salad. Wait take that back. That was supposed to be my first course. I believe I really got romaine lettuce, croutons and dressing of the day. It definitely was *not* Caesar. This left me sad. The bread with it though was pretty damn good although I suggest bigger bottles of balsamic. We ran out fast! 

My main course was chicken marsala and a side of penne. The penne came with a paste (note I did not say sauce) and seemed a little dry and bland. The chicken marsala was actually decent but pretty run of the mill and nothing spectacular. 

Dessert involved two mini cannolis. Like the pasta, they seemed a little dry and lacking, but were flavorful. 

Overall my meal was really just okay. The service was also nothing outstanding either, including someone having to ask for water on several occasions.
You have to pay to get in, but it is seriously worth it. Beautiful ladies and a good kick back environment here. I saw a lot of ladies coming in with who I think were their boyfriends or husbands. Good vibes and good live pole dancing.
I went in to the LV location back in March and I have not been back... A place I once frequented, now is on my "no go" list.  The place was half full and it took 20 minutes for our server to come take our order, food came out in an timely manner, but wasn't  cooked right, I asked for rare, got done-done steak. Our server kept showing her tattoos to the group next to us which I could swear, they didn't ask to see. Also, she was inappropriate with her stories of her private life. I don't mind small talk, but there is a limit.  I was also giving my toddler little bits of veggies and he had pulled the paper place mat off the table and I placed some food on the table which he smashed up on the table. So, I took a napkin and wiped up the mess, as I folded it back onto itself, the dirt that came up with the food... I was appalled. I should have talked to management, but I gathered my family and we left. i hope that they have cleaned the place by now, but I'll stick to going to the California locations they seem to be clean.
This place is unlike any other. First of all, the name is unusual. The restaurant is tucked away and has trees surrounding the building. It almost feels like you're away from Arizona. The place is set up like a deli but also like a small store and a coffee bar and an art gallery and a patio space...super unique. I love the selection of foods and beverages. Ordering is simple (that is when you know what you want) and you have a chance to browse through the aisles as you wait for your order. They also have a loft space upstairs to enjoy your food but there's seating downstairs and outside on multiple patios. Perfect place for a weekday lunch or a brunch with your friends.
My stove ignitor was broken.  They contacted me right away, came out the next morning and had it done in 15 minutes.  My oven was slowly dying, which I didn't know because now it heats up quick and works like new.  Thank you so much for the great price and service.  Loved it that I was able to pay with my card and not have to have cash on me.  I will always come back to you guys when I need anything else.
In response to Just J.  Corliss actually sold his business to H&R block last year. Prior to then we had been using him 8 years. All of those years we had perfect service. 

So that being said this is not a rating on Curt himself but H&R block. Because he sold the business name and his customer contacts they keep calling us! They are trying to use his name to drum up business! If you ask them if you can get an appointment with Curt they offer you one with one of their accountants but at no point say they are  in facr H&R block. 

Curt told us last year that he sold and was retiring. Last years was a terrible mess. Horrible office service, the office manager was bad but I'm pretty sure they went through a few. 

So don't be fooled folks...this is no longer Curtis' business it belongs to H&R block and they suck. DO NOT GO THERE.
Quick disclosure... I grew up in a Korean house, eating my Mom's amazing cooking. Also, I lived in Denver for quite some time. Which has an abnormally high Korean population with awesome Korean restaurants. So, I realize that my bar for Korean food is set really high. 

I'm super disappointed that I couldn't give Cho Won Garden more stars. I really wanted it to be awesome. Korean food is awesome when it is executed well. The flavors are diverse, intense, and exciting. Korean BBQ is a fun and unique experience. Cho Won couldn't deliver on any of those counts. Bland kimchee & dwaeji bulgogi... Really!! Bland is the last word that should describe kimchee & dwaeji bulgogi (spicy pork)! The broth of the mandoo duk soup was straight up msg flavor. Not the complex beefy broth that it should be. 

Service was fine. Like many Korean restaurants, they had the doorbell to call a server over when you needed them. Which means they won't come and check on your regularly. Don't be afraid to use it!

Bland. Boring. Far from authentic... Please don't let Cho Won be how you judge Korean food. I won't be back.
I love this place! The decor looks better than most restaurants in Parc-Ex and the taste is pretty comparable too. I visited this place twice and was pleasantly surprised both times. The first time we ordered the (giant!) Mirch Masala dosa and the chicken biryani. The dosa was very tasty; I haven't had many in my life but I found this one to be crispy and filled with savory spiced mashed potatoes. The chicken biryani was very enjoyable but I prefer the shrimp version which I tried on my next visit. For appetizers, the bonda potato was a fun change from samosas. The filling tasted essentially the same, but instead of being wrapped in pastry dough, the spicy potato filling was fried in chickpea flour. The chilli uttapam was really unique, nice and spongey, reminding me of a tasty Ethiopian lamb crepe I had at East Africa (I should get started on that review too!). I also tried the chicken pepper curry dish, which tasted average compared to the other dishes. 

I can't wait to go back to try their other dishes, especially the 6-foot long dosa! Sounds great for a party :)
My wife and I came here with 2 friends for early dim sum.  The dim sum is very reasonable priced if you order before 11am ($3.10 per dish).  We got a variety of dim sum as usual.  I enjoyed the egg tart and the rice noodle rolls the most.  Overall, all the food was fairly fresh, I'd say the quality of the food in general above average.  The service is average, you would probably have to wave at the waiters to get service, but they got our stuff right away when we asked for it (ie. hot sauce).  There is probably a line up to get a table if you are coming in before 11.  But if you come in after 11 it dies down by quite a bit as one would expect since the special is over.  I will definitely be coming back to Gold Mark Chinese Cuisine in the future.
My fiance and I were out running errands around town this past weekend and passed by this place.  I mentioned wanting to try it sometime and that I had been to a place with the same concept many years ago in Tempe and thought it was really cool.  After we were done running errands we were headed back the same direction and came up to Ghenghis and he pulled in the parking lot and suggested we go ahead and try it.  We walk in and wait to be seated like the sign says, right off the bat I notice several employees walk by without even acknowledging us.  Then this male employee walks over with a bewildered look on his face, like he clearly is not used to seating people.  I thought he'd figure it out since it's not exactly a large restaurant.  We should have just grabbed a seat at their bar!  He told us someone would be right with us and a girl came over and sat us...right next to the server station.  Whatever I was starving and didn't really care at that time.  Neither one of us had been there so our waitress who sat us rapidly explained the process, she went thru it so fast I just decided we should fill out their form and have them make our bowls for us.  When she got back to us for our order we ordered drinks, I got a coke and he ordered a beer.  We proceeded to sit there for about 20 minutes, meanwhile at the table next to us some people sat down after us and were brought their meals and were almost done!  Our waitress comes over and says our food should be out any minute, not long after that another woman comes over ( I assume the manager since she wasn't wearing a server uniform) and says that they are out of two of the seafood items that my fiance had ordered.  He changed his order and we continued to wait all the while thinking why the hell didn't they tell us that in the first place!  Then as we waited and waited some more I started wondering why our waitress said our food should be out soon when they clearly hadn't even started cooking it yet if they didn't even possess the food to cook it.  By this point I was extremely hungry and irritated, I had half a coke left his beer was empty and the waitress comes by and drops off a fresh coke that I felt like she did only to try and make up for our wait.  But maybe she should have thought of asking if my fiance wanted another beer since his was empty!  She did stop to ask if they had told us they were out of his order and said she would take our bowls off, whatever that meant.  We continued to wait a few more minutes until I just couldn't wait any longer.  We got up to leave and walked passed the manager lady sitting at a bar table who said thanks for coming...ya thanks for NOTHING!  They weren't even what I would call busy.  I have never had to walk out on service like that.  I was looking forward to a cool new experience and ended up being extremely disappointed.  I will never go there again!
If you're in the Downtown Vegas area, and are looking for some quick and delicious Thai food, this is the place.  Both my date and I enjoyed Really good drinks, as well - the bartender there is excellent!  I'm a vegetarian, and there are plenty of options here, no matter your diet (vegan options are also available).  When I ordered the tofu pad thai, the server checked in with me about the fish sauce that it's made with; since I don't eat fish, I was very grateful he asked - not all restaurants are so up front.  Delicious eats!  I definitely plan to return here.
The place is really cool but food is way overpriced for what you get. Just paid 16$ for a beet salad smaller than my hand with some added shrimp which were soggy and clearly previously frozen.. come for the booze not the food. They also ran out of beer steins and hummus!
We tried Gateway Grill for the first time after hearing a time or two that it was one of the best local places in Monroeville.  We were seated right away in the bar area and the energy and atmosphere is really great, as long as you're looking for that loud, fast paced kind of place.  The menu is big, and the beer list is bigger (woohoo!), so there are options for everyone!  Our service was decent as was our food, and after we ate we spent about an addition hour or hour and a half just sitting at our table talking, and we never felt rushed or like we were inconveniencing anyone by staying, which was really nice seeing as we were enjoying ourselves and weren't quite ready to call it a night.  I originally wanted to try one of their Philly Cheesesteaks (they have 4 different varieties), but ended up changing my order last minute because of a food allergy I have and they unfortunately couldn't guarantee that they could prevent cross contamination (bummer, but greatly appreciated the honesty), so I ended up ordering an Italian Sub as a last minute decision.  My sub was pretty good.. maybe it's because it's not what I really wanted, but I didn't totally love it, however I will say that it was HUGE, and I was able to have the 2nd half of it for lunch the next day.  

We'll definitely be back to Gateway Grill in the near future, and I'll be sure to try something that I actually want this time, haha!  In all seriousness though, we enjoyed ourselves and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good time at a friendly place!
In my quest as a frequent Vegas traveler to stay at all the nice hotels on the strip, the Aria was my next stop. 

The building is absolutely stunning. The inside is top notch and plenty of things around that'll catch your eye. The water wall outside is really cool, make sure you snap a picture by it.

The room was very nice. I love that it was so modern. My favorite thing about the room by far has to be the tablet that controls everything in the room. I would myself just finding any reason to do something with it. I also liked the shower\/tub combination in the bathroom. The room was very clean and room service did an excellent job keeping everything tidy. 

The casinos has a lot of games to play. If you're into slots, they have plenty of those. I'm a table game person and it was tons of those around to indulge in. I'm also a sports better and they have one of the best I've been to on the strip. Nice amount of tables and seats to sit at and enjoy all the action. 

I didn't partake into any of the restaurants at the hotel, but from what I could see, there were nice size crowds there. Something must be good at them! 

Check in was a breeze and very quick. Staff was nice, attentive, and did their job extremely well. What more could I ask for. I really enjoyed my stay at the Aria. I will definitely be back and can't wait!
If you love your furry children this is where you take them!

I found this lady purely by accident as the leading groomer for show cats we had been going to forever in Chicago moved on to other ventures. We were lost. Reluctantly I brought my little one to a Vegas groomer while on vacation. 
After this experience, I will never take her anywhere else. 
Not only did this woman and amazing artist create the perfect lion cut for my munchkin, over the top of what the award winning prior groomer could do, her facility was open and free-range- leaving no worry or disconcern about where they were taking the animal and how they were treating it.
As I reluctantly drop my kid off I watch the quality workmanship in the fluffy, perfectly manicured dogs leaving this shop and I am put to ease. 
What I got however in result FAR EXCEEDED my expectations! 
Professional as they come, this salon did my little one's ears and nails- taking the time to give her personalized attention,  and returned her happy and smiling and smelling like fresh apples :)
This woman's business is so underrated it's shocking- it is something out of a Dupont Registry.  She is a true animal whispering rock star and we are so lucky to have stumbled upon this epic service! 
I will be flying us back indefinately to recreate the happy, fresh smelling perfectly groomed kitten I just brought home. 
If you're within a 12 hour flight of this place and your pet needs groomed it's well worth it! You definitely won't be disappointed!
Beautifully renovated facility with lounge seating throughout the lobby.

The season ticket parking is super convenient and worth the $12.  You are just an elevator ride away.

The snack areas have a full bar and coffee and some pastries.

The symphony hall is right near several great hotels and eateries.  The perfect refined date includes a symphony experience here at Phoenix symphony hall.
We had decided to buy an iPad, so I was very excited to go to the Apple store and buy it.  It was a bit of an anticlimax though.  After dropping almost a thousand dollars on the thing, I didn't find the good people at the Apple store to be particularly helpful or accommodating.  

They had a "personal setup" guy who was responsible for me and another guy.  The other guy was more clueless than I was, so he (the Apple Personal Setup "expert") ended up spending the majority of his time helping him.  As a result, when I encountered problems I didn't really get the understanding and helpful ear that I'd expected from a store supposedly known for their customer service.  

The problems I solved for myself snowballed into other problems and at one point the personal setup guy consulted another guy, and when neither knew the answer he said, "I don't really know what to do here," then turned back to the clueless guy, who was less inconvenient to help.

I eventually solved my own problem, but my personal setup guy took his lunch break.  So I packaged up my ipad. . . went behind the counter, got my own Apple store bag, slipped it inside and left.  

I was reminded of the South Park episode where it's Christmas, and all the kids in South Park are consumed with opening and playing with their presents and they show a cutaway of Jesus (who on South Park is an actual character (or used to be)) sitting all alone with a party hat on singing "Happy Birthday to Me" mournfully.  

Stupid Apple store.  On top of that, they used my patch cord from my Ipad box (I've since learned this isn't SOP) and when I boxed everything up I forgot the patch cord in the stupid store.  If I bring my receipt back to the store they said they'd give me another one.  Fantastic.
Great casino off the strip for locals. You don't have to deal with all of the tourists, like you have to on the strip. The Red Rock has my favorite sports book of all the casinos in Vegas. Nothing is better than NFL Sundays at the Red Rock. Doesn't get any better than that.

The Red Rock has a great pool area and very nice rooms. They have luxury suites up top with amazing views of the valley. There are many restaurants to choose from when you get hungry. They have Lucile's, Yard House, T-Bones, LBS Burger, Feast Buffet, and a few more places. There is also a Food Court.

There is also a Regal Cinema in the building and they also have a huge bowling alley. They even have a place to check young children in to where they can play while you are in the casino. I would never leave my kid there, but it is there if you want to.

Great place over all!!
Cornish Pasty is...wow. It's almost indescribable. It's really that good. First of all, any pub that has Hoegaarden on draft is automatically a winner in my book. When you add that plus a great happy hour, life is good. If you just want to get your drink on after a long day at the office, Cornish is hard to beat. If you want to drink AND eat (two of the best things a person can do) you will have an evening to remember. I'm vegetarian and this place has a ton of options for me. The Veggie Oggie and The Greek are my favorites--make sure you get a side of HP if they have it. You won't regret it. As long as this place is open, my husband and I will be frequent visitors.
Avoid!
They are under different management\/ownership.  Don't expect the same service and quality. Everything used to be ordered and delivered exactly like I wanted. I went yesterday and didn't receive what I asked for nor was it correct when I did get it. Loyal customer not coming back.
My fiancé and I paid 15$ per person for dinner on a weekend night. Food wasn't  bad... Just not worth it. Not a huge selection too for the price. Also, there was no background music in the dining area so it felt kinda awkward eating in silence... Especially for 15$ a person. I'll be going elsewhere for Chinese food. -Justin
This is my go-to Starbucks. Because of the multi-level layout, I usually have a few options of where to sit, and my favorite place is the main level. There are two tables, one of which facilitates easy-access to one's laptop without discomfort--to those of us dealing with back issues, this is great. The baristas are kind. I recommend.
I am not a seafood fan.  I came here because others in the group are fans.  Just like all other seafood joints they have other options.  The decor is cool and modern.  The service is solid.  It is quite expensive for what you get.  Part of that is because you are in Las Vegas, but at those price points I expect more.

For my meal I ordered the Cedar River Filet Mignon.  The filet comes with a red wine jus.  The filet was solid.  It was prepared as ordered.  The problem is I was expecting a $54 filet, and got a $35-$40 filet.  I had hoped for better flavor and texture.  It was by no means bad, it just did not live up to expectations.

For a side I chose the Old Bay Fries with remoulade.  The fries were ok.  The remoulade had good flavor.  Once again, for the price you want and expect more.

Overall this is a solid place.  My review will not help most as I did not eat any of the seafood options.  You will get a good meal here, but for the price you can get a much better meal in Las Vegas.
Good little tire shop. I came in for an alignment they were very nice and I was served expediently. Comfortable waiting room.
It's hard to write the dim sum is bad when you arrive hungry!!!  Both my son & I were famished and as soon as we sat down, the carts filled with delicious morsels started to stop by our table.  

As usual, we selected more food than 2 people can possibly eat but we didn't care as everything was yummy to the tummy!!!  My son kept saying, "Mom, this here food is soooo good!!!" 

We don't have dim sum that often so we indulged and between the 2 of us ordered about 10 dishes . . . if you eat dim sum, you can attest that this is a lot of food!!!

And we enjoyed every bit of it- with plenty of left overs to take home, of course.  Are there left overs in dim sum or just another delicious morsel for later???

Hmmm, something to ponder.  Haha.
Kinda odd place to dine since I'm a local here with no habit of gambling, and I have no business coming to LV down town... but wow, I have to say, this is the place you can come to get the great lunch\/dinner for affordable price! I had a bowl of tomato soup and I splitted goat cheese chicken pizza. Bill was no more than $25 I believe... and I felt like I was at spago! Soup was simple and perfect, not too acidic and basil played nice side kick to it. Pizza had so much flavor, I rubbed my tongue many times just to taste everything in my mouth. Very satisfying. My friend ordered a plate of lasagne and it was also out of this world too. Great ambience, not too crowded, and it stays open at weird time (like 3pm where everywhere else closes down). Highly recommended!!
I wish I could leave a review for the food but I never got that far. 

Came in, was immediately seated and handed the menu. 20 minutes later still no waiter, no acknowledgment from any of the servers or anyone that works there. So we decided to leave, I'm all for being patient but  20 minutes with no acknowledgement REALLY?! Sorry, we were told happy new year on the way out. Did I mention the place was only at 60% capacity. 

Thanks Osaka you really know how to treat your customers.
Such a cool place!  Love to just hang here, relax with friends, get some food, and grab a drink.  The outside is so neat at night - cool outside lighting, mini fire pits to sit around, etc.  Can't wait to come back here!
Well I have been coming here since I was little for mountain biking equipment and Skiing equipment and everything in between and have always loved it. Everyone working here is always really really nice and just so polite. They seem to know everything about everything and are always eager to help. If they don't know the answer to something, they will find out for you and if they don't have something in stock they will find it for you. Now this was when I was younger and now? It's no different and NOW THEY HAVE REMODELED!! 

REI's West Towne location is now massive beacon of your outdooring needs. As many people probably know that REI is aimed a little more toward the more serious and extreme outdoorsman. Including things such as winter camping and mountain climbing. They have a lot of other stuff for everyone though. The new building is gorgeous and one of my favorite features of it is the massive front doors and Ice picks for door handles. You get an immediate feeling that you are about to embark on an outdoor adventure and don't know when you may return. I feel that the combination of the new store and the relaxed personalities of the employees excite you to buy everything and go out into the wilderness and see where you end up. It is fantastic. I have never had a bad experience here and I really hope not to. Everything here is very well separated and categorized you know exactly "what department" you are in without knowing you have ever transitioned into another area of expertise.

This store does extremely well and I only hope more success for it. That'll do REI.... That'll do....
This Big O Tires is amazing.  The people that work there are all friendly and are willing to help.  I needed some major work done Casey was wonderful to explain everything to me and give me a few different price quotes.  When I went back to have the services performed Tim was wonderful to look up all the previous information and help me make the decision that best worked for my situation. Not only did they give great service they finished earlier than expected and Under the quoted price.  Because there were coupons on the website. I will definitely be back to this location.
This is a great experience holistically.  Have your car valeted.  It's only $4.  Very affordable.  The elevator up to the Grotto gives you a great view of the city.  When you make your reservations, you need to ask for "view seating" but outside of that, getting a reservation is seamless.  You can reserve online through their website.

I went with a mentor\/colleague to "celebrate" a job termination (don't ask) and we had the whole experience.  Our waitress was very nice and tentative.  One of the managers, who is a wine afficianto, helped us pick out a good wine on the moderately priced side.  The wine was fantastic.  

We ordered steamed clams as an appetizer and -oh so good- with their hot bread to dip in the sauce.  The manager learned I lost my job and brought us a "chocolate cake" drink, on the house, which was very nice.  

House salads were fresh and a nice size portyion.  I ordered the mahi mahi and it was fantastic.  Nice size portion, fresh.  Only complaint was that the lemon wedge was too small to put over the fish...

Finally, the dessert...  I had the white chocolate macadamia mousse.  To. die. for.

Certainly the restaurant is pricey, but the food quality was good, the atmosphere is nice, and the staff are very friendly.  This is a good special occasion restaurant.
This is one of the better Embassy Suites in the chain. It is right near the Convention Center (walking distance) and a short walk to the monorail that goes to The Strip. It is on Paradise, about 2 long blocks from Las Vegas Blvd (the Strip). 

The good thing is that it is a business oriented hotel with large 2 room suites at reasonable rates. In the summertime, you can get under $100, even on weekends (if there isn't a big show, which there usually isn't in the dead of summer). The reason this is a good thing, is if you come to Las Vegas for business like I do, the last thing I want to do is have to walk 20 minutes through a huge casino and another 20 minutes around a huge parking lot just to get to my car. That's worse if you are lugging stuff each way. Here, you just step outside and there is your car.  

Now if you are just coming to Vegas for your once a year get drunk and wild party, then maybe this isn't for you. On the other hand, if you are staying for a few days and want to save some money for the casinos or shows, this is a good choice. It has free hot breakfast and free happy hour during the week, like all Embassy Suites. There is also free WiFi in you suite and throughout the Atrium..

The hotel itself is a little hard to get to off Paradise, but is nicely kept, with 12 stories, a great atrium, the signature glass elevators and greenery, a mezzanine third floor lounge, indoor pool and outdoor jacuzzi. The rooms are 2 room suites with vanity and armoir in the bedroom with 2 doubles or a king, and the front room has a sofabed, lounge chair, table for 4, wetbar, microwave, and minifridge.The decor is simple elegance in contemporary colors, with marble tiling in the bathroom and minibar. 

The lobby fountain is a soothing interplay of water jets, programmed in playful arrays, like a mini Bellagio fountain show. 

If you want more money to spend on food, shows, and gambling, don't want to walk into a smokey casino every time you want to go to your car half a mile a way or take a dip in the pool, and don't mind getting free breakfast and happy hour and quick in and out to your car without walking or waiting for 20 minutes, stay here, particularly if you have a trade show to attend at the convention center, or you are on a sensible budget and been to Vegas many times before.
(For me) there is not much to say about this tourist attraction, other than it is quite amazing to go up to the sky pod to see the surrounding city. The view is breathtaking and a little bit nerve racking if you don't like heights (especially if you go walk on the glass floor).
Cheeseburgers make the world a better place.. Growing up in Southern Cali, cheeseburgers are the first thing your parent fed you when you get your first tooth. Either In & Out, Tommy's or Fatburgers! So I cant find any reason or thing bad about them. Always animal style, a good friend of mine always ordered a 4x4 or 6x6 animal style when we were still in high school. Wish we could still eat like that! Hahaha, we used to order animal style burgers and fries combo "beast
Does anyone even go to a dive bar to get spectacular service? Even when it's empty? Nope.

What do you go here for? People watching. Relaxing. Chatting with some friends. Chatting with some random strangers. Having a brew while you're at it. 

All of these things I can do at Coach House. All of these things I love doing at Coach House.

Outdoors is by far my favorite place to sit. I feel here is where people watching is at its finest and the true dive bar comes out. It's also where the bouncers have been when I've came by at night... and they have some awesome stories to share themselves. 

Sure you will smell cigarettes. Sure your heels may stick to the screwdriver and PBR laced floor. But why are you wearing heels to begin with? And sure, you may feel like you need a hazmat shower when you leave, but that's all part of the fun.
Startup...is it still a startup after 7 weeks?  Startup restaurant in an already highly competitive downtown area.  

It was good, not great, so I hope it holds on because...

Some intriguing options...a rum bar with 200 varieties of rum?  I feel like this is a good idea...a rum option for the folks who have exhausted the ryes, whiskeys and wines of other spirited competition (see what I did there?  spirited?  like...spirits?).  Caribbean theme too is a bit different than the run-of-the-mill in Pittsburgh.  

We sat at a high table along the wall.  The seats didn't have a foot rest, so half the people just dangled their feet off the edge of their seats like toddlers at the grown up table.  The waiter came off rude and disinterested at first but honestly, I just think he was extremely dry.  By the end of the meal we found him quite entertaining. 

The manager visited our table and apologized (not that we'd complained) proactively about 'getting the kinks worked out' and explained that he was unhappy with some of the menu and decor (he indicated that the current menu is only a partial of what it ultimately will become).  And in truth, I thought the menu was a little entree light.  

Cuban\/Dominican\/Jamaican fare...we visited on the day Castro died and I had Ropa Vieja.  It seemed fitting.  It tasted vaguely communist, but in all seriousness was again...good not great.  I thought it was well-prepared and tasty, but there's only so much you can do with skirt steak, rice, and beans.  

I had a Mojito Royale which was really good, and a Golden Hind...which came across as "Kamikaze in a nice glass".  I had another drink, but I'm getting two elderly to remember what it was.

I'm cautiously optimistic about the place.  I'd like to go back and try one of the rum\/cocktail flights.  That looked like fun, but wasn't really what I was looking for when we visited.

I feel like there's a place for Pirata once they get their sea legs.  I'll go back and give it another whirl.
I went here a couple of weeks ago, it is brand new and clean. We love the one in town square so i was happy one was opening by my house. Dinner was pretty good for them just opening a week before but i still feel the prices do not match what you get. The worse part was the food poisoning or bug that me & the bf had TWO weeks after this meal. I though the fish tasted extremely fishy and should have sent it back.. But overall, good service & nice location. Never eating here again tho.
Kip is one of the best tattoo artists I have had tattoo me. He's an amazing artist in all aspects. Kip kind of went out of his way for my brother and I to get these stupid matching tattoos. I'm actually shocked he didn't charge more! Definitely can't wait to get more work done by him! #yolo
Needed a night out with the girls. Wanted something relaxed, classy. Good spot, No cover, reasonable drinks. They don't serve food anymore on Friday nights, but we were able to get a cheese plate out of the kitchen : ) 
Crowd appeared 30's and Up. Music was a mixture....
I will never understand how it took me so long to get around to coming here. And if I'm not back within two weeks then I shall eat my hat.

Because first of all... Colour. It is like walking into a rainbow of happiness. The walls are made of colours and on them are fluorescent vinyls painted with adorable characters and scenes (these are for sale and I would like one please if anyone reading this is looking for a present for me).

Aurelie M and I were lucky to get a table - we arrived right at the start of the lunch wave; ten minutes later and it could have been curtains for our lunch plans. Lacy, gently wafting curtains...

I opted for the Cajun wrap, which was wonderful, toasted to crispness on the outside and burrito-like in contents. With the side salad it was the perfect amount. I also had the Betty Ford juice, which was delicious and tasted very wholesome. I tried Aurelie's Pink lady too and it was SO GOOD. I want a whole one to myself!

Aside from a slightly perfuctory dump-dishes-and-run moment from the staff member so brought our orders (totally understandable given that the place was packed by then) this was a wonderful experience from start to finish and we never felt rushed to move on despite the people who never stopped appearing.
Went here with a large group for a birthday party.  Service was excellent...until it wasn't.  Had to go ask for after dinner coffee, and the tab.

The age group ranged from low 20's to mid 70's and everyone was disappointed.  The music was too loud to carry on a conversation and just not "right" for this place.  It is suffering from an identity crisis in my opinion.  

The food....meh.  The fondue beer dip was good, the mac and cheese was good.  The short ribs were fatty, the hamburger was rock hard and the hamburger bun dry, the chicken was o.k. and the salad was 'bitter'.  

Definitely won't be on our rotation.
J'adore le  décor   c'est  chaleureux .  J'avais  mangé un  bon  hamburger au bison  vraiment  délicieux  leur  bière  était  bien    aussi  .   

Mais  la  deuxième  la  la  nourriture  était était  fade  et manquait  de  saveur  !!!  C'est  seulement  la  bière  qui  était  bonne
This location has the best customer service I've ever received from a Port of Subs. The veggie\/avocado sub I had was pretty good but nothing to write home about. I would eat here again if I was in the area.
Weekday morning- healthy lifestyle shopper here!!

San pallegrino water 2\/$3, slim can Perrier 10 pack $3.99, expanded organic produce selection- super fresh berries and grapes.

Opportunities with this store are the limited organic yogurt options! The gentleman stocking the dairy asked if I was finding everything ok so I asked about the organic yogurt... Only 1 Greek vanilla with 26g sugar, and plain goat milk yogurt.  He actually was super nice to open it up so I could taste it and yes it was very goaty!  I thanked him and got a non organic Siggs plain yogurt.

Self check out was easy.  My reason for 4 stars is also they were moving these huge carts all through the store blocking most aisles... Overall the employees were in my way at least 5 times and I was nearly always in the perimeter.  Maybe one of them could clean the bird poop off my cart cup holder?

The Starbucks inside this Safeway had no wait.
Super cute place. Have lived in this neighborhood my whole life and wish I found it sooner. Very intimate. Would love to come back and do a date night on Thursday when wine bottles are half off. Kinda pricey other than that no complaints. Had the drunken noodles soo good!
It's nice, that's all. Otherwise the popcorn is just blah, waaaaay overpriced.... But the drink selection is massive. I say 3 stars, but with a heavy heart.
The Last of the Mohicans.
 
The Last Samurai.

The Last... Boy Scout. 

And coming this summer:  The Last of the Bookstores (east side suburb edition). 

Like seriously, what's up with the lack of bookstores in my area??

Apparently, people who live in between Woodmere and Mentor are pegged as people who don't like to read\/buy books. Which is false but would be only explanation of all the bookstores closing like their name was Tops.

But like Sophia Petrillo, I digress.

This bookstore is massive. It's pretty neat in appearance, has a Starbucks inside and a kid section - standard stuff. No complaints really and I come in a few times a year when I run out of Audible credits, when I'm tired of reading books on my Kindle and want to feel a physical book in my hands or when I don't want to drive to Mentor. 

The only issue I have is the location. That area of Woodmere is a zoo. The parking lot is a battle field and no, not of love, but of sheer annoyance, verging on rage. The parking lot, while huge, seems extremely tight. Like they took a big area and decided to fit 1,000 car spots when there was really only room for 500. Here you'll experience car horns and a million people walking in front of your car and a stream of cars preventing you from backing out of your tiny parking spot and and and... yeah, not a fan.

For that reason, I usually drive a bit further to Mentor for a piece of mind. Oh and Sumo Boy.
Definitely enjoyed lunch here. Outdoor patio has lots of shady seating. We had the Jess Pizza on gf crust. Garlic oil with motzerella, spinach, bacon, roasted garlic, and ricotta. The crust was nice and crispy. The flavor was great and we enjoyed it.

The salads looked good and I heard they have great beer selection, although I'm not a beer drinker.
My mozzarella, fresh mozzarella, spicy sausage, and chicken pizza was cooked perfectly, chewy and crispy with no sogginess!  I asked for a drizzle of (runny and light-colored) balsamic on top after it was finished, and while a bit too watery, it definitely added to the flavor.

The spicy sausage does have a kick that hits you after, but it was manageable, and I don't care for spicy food in general.

$9.12 after tax makes this a great choice worth the small wait while they bake the pizza.
My husband, being the meat eater that he is, suggested we try this place.  I being less of a meat enthusiast than he was a little skeptical, but wasn't disappointed in the least.  It's definitely a meat eaters paradise, but for don't be discouraged if meat isn't your thing, because there are plenty of other options as well.  It's the same concept as Texas de Brazil, only it's locally owned and it's less pricey.  You'll pay about $45 per person, but it's all you can eat and the food is very high quality, especially the meat dishes.  I did try 1 or 2, and they were very good.  My husband took advantage of just about everything they came around with, and he certainly was satisfied.  I will say, the buffet portion probably wouldn't satisfy everybody- it's not your typical "buffet food", but there certainly is a variety to choose from.  

Our service was very good and she was very nice.  I mean, what else can I say?  That about sums it up.. we went for the food, but the good service was a bonus.

The location is a little odd, and is easy to miss if you aren't looking for it.  It's not a place you'll stop at because you see if from the road or drive by it multiple times.  It's located up on the hill away from the mail road, on the bottom floor of an office building.  I have driven Rodi Road hundreds of times, and I never even knew it was there.  I thought my gps had taken us to the wrong place, until we pulled into the parking lot.  So keep an eye out when you're driving there!
I LOVE this place. The staff is friendly and soooo talented. They take requests and are willing to learn songs if they don't already know them. We had a blast here, and I will definitely be back!
I've never had a worse service than Forno Cultura. I came here on a rainy sunday morning. There was barely any line. I ordered tortila sandwich, $5 pastry box, polpette & arancini. They forgot to give me the polpette & arancini. When I called and asked them regarding their mistake, there wasn't a single sorry. They basically said that I could come back to get a refund or get the polpette & arancini. Not a single sorry for being an inconvenience even though they're in the hospitality business. On another day, I would just be a bit pissed that they make me come back again for their mistake without a single remorse. But that day, I had to go to the airport for a flight out of town. If there is a next time, I will make sure to double check everything before I leave the place because of how incompetent these people are. #EuropeanCafe #KingWestPrice #ChinatownAttitude
This large AYCE place is sort of like Todai meets PF Chang's. 

It is located in the Place Longueuil shopping mall on the South Shore off St. Laurent, not too far from the Pont Jacques-Cartier. 

Todai is known in California for it's all you can eat sushi in mass quantities, buffet style. PF Chang's, that Scottsdale, AZ HQ'd Chinese chain, is known for its large faux statues. Sushi Palace combines these. 

The place is very large, seating over 100 people, maybe up to 200 if you used every seat. The space has high ceilings and is airy, with large columns covered with ancient Chinese calligraphy, and above the sushi counter and kitchen, large Buddha statues on the upper half of the wall. These are not Japanese looking Buddhas, but skinnier Chinese looking ones. Nonetheless, they add to the PF Chang likeness of the massive horses they use in front of those faux Chinese eateries. 

And speaking of faux, this is faux Japanese, as it is owned and staffed with Chinese. And although it is an AYCE place, it is not a buffet. You sit, get a waiter, order off little sushi or other item check lists, and they go order it for you from the cooks\/chefs under the Buddhas. 

They do have a large selection and variety of foods. They carry most common Nigiri sushi items (except Uni and other more exotics), and some sashimi as well. And they offer other popular Japanese dishes like Yakitori au Boeuf and Tempura aux Crevettes. Actually, they have 5 different Yakitoris and Tempura selections. 

But if you feel like mixing your Japanese with Chinese, try the Poisson Szechuannais ou L'agneau Mongolien. Thinking about noodles? They have Pad Thai au Poulet ou Boeuf, ou Udon.  They even have on Vendredis et Samedis la Cuisine Chaude, "Boulettes de Pieuvre" ou Takoyaki! And being in Quebec, they offer Escargots Gratines. Oh, and if you want a little flavor of Korea, order the Kimchi! No Poutine, though!

The service was actually pretty friendly and efficient, and the food wasn't bad for an AYCE place. Dinner is $25.50, and you fill out your 2 tickets, and when you are ready, fill 2 more out till you're full. 

If you feel like Asian food but want a variety and you are really hungry, this place is meant for you. Bon Appetit!
I am so enamored with this place I am a lifetime member. I live nowhere near it and somehow find myself there every couple of months. The movie is cute and the pupa station interesting, but I breeze by. Because I need pure butterflies.
My family and I have been dining at this place for probably over 7 years. I've never had a bad experience. Their food is delicious. I always get the Koobideh (Ground beef kebab). My father loves their Lamb shanks. Their Persian ice cream is delicious and I love their bread! Will never get bored of this place!
I usually come here after 12am and I can't complaint about the service, I always get it on time and the people working are always friendly and polite. Also, if you ever have problems with any item they'll rapidly replace it for you. The only thing I hate is not being able to eat anything other than breakfast after 4am, that makes me drive to Jack in the box. In other countries, even during breakfast hours you can still order other regular hours menu items..
Small mom and pop operation.  Went here for a reflexology with Harold.  Very comfortable atmosphere.  As soon as I sat in the chair and was covered in towels, I promptly fell asleep which is always a good sign.
And another good sign is the next day, I felt physically better, not just at my feet but overall sense of good health.
Best 80 mins ever spent!
WOW. The philosophy at Dressler's Restaurants is simple: Everyone who walks through our doors is either already a friend, or will be. Our entire experience embraced that. 

Fantastic meal with even better service. My friend and I went for a Treat Yourself Thursday dinner. Dressler's is located in the Met. Complimentary valet will park your car or you can park it yourself in the garage. 

The interior had a swanky and classy but not over the top feel. The entire menu looked fantastic. Our server made fantastic food recommendations so we decided to order them. In true Treat Yo'self form, we decided that wine was on the docket. They have an iPad which serves as their wine, beer, cocktail, dessert menu. We decided to trust it to the pros and told the manager\/wine-guy our budget and food choices and let him go from there. He really delivered! 

The calamari was great. Instead of rings and tentacles, they used calamari steaks that were cut into strips, soaked in buttermilk, lightly battered and fried. They served it tossed in a Thai peanut sauce with wasabi drizzle. A completely different but amazing calamari experience. 

For entrees, we chose the Just for the Halibut and Heart of Ribeye. Both fantastic choices. It was a great surf-and-turf combo. This is one of those places were you shouldn't skip dessert. The cheesecake was killer. Not dense and overly sweet like some places, but light and almost refreshing. 

Overall, it was a pricey but totally worth it meal. I would recommend it for special occasions or just when you feel fancy. 

Thanks for a wonderful evening, Dressler's. I'm looking forward to returning soon.
Loved it.  Lived up to the hype IMO.

Since this place has been reviewed ad naseum, I'll keep this short (er).  Cure has been on my list of places to try for a long time.  Finally went with my DH last night.  We shared the small salumi, the goat rodeo brulee, and the bread.  All were fantastic, particularly the brulee.  (I don't think I've ever felt like paying for bread was worth it before...) DH had the duck and I had a half order of the Tagliatelle.  We both liked our dishes.  Mine was by far the best pasta dish I've had in ages, perhaps ever.  For drinks, he:  bourbon cocktail and a red rye beer (blanking on which); me: gin cocktail (probably the only thing I ordered I'd skip next time), a pinotage (a nice change from the usuals you see), and a flight of amaros (DO THIS!).  Service was very knowledgeable and perhaps over-attentive? Total tab was $125 before tip,which was more than reasonable for what we had.

Bottom line:  I loved the experience and the combination of flavors and ideas.  If you're a foodie and enjoy eating as an event, this place is definitely for you.  (Apparently, the mayor agrees... he was seated a few tables down.)  However, if you are a food purist or think too many flavors clutter a plate, you'll think this place is over-priced\/over-hyped and might find the portion sizes too small.  (If you think Olive Garden is actually Italian food or would identify a steak joint as your favorite restaurant, I'm looking at you...)  My husband fell into this later category -- he appreciated the execution and thought the dishes were well-done, but the place wouldn't rank on his list of favorites.  He said if we were given a GC and could eat for free, he'd likely have me take my mother (who would enjoy the meal more than he).  

Also, you certainly do seem to need a res to get into this place even on Sunday early.
We all scream for ice cream! WAIT, we all scream for RECESS!!!
No ice cream here, Italian Ices and custards:)
Endless possibilities which requires a long recess:)  friendly staff, and yes they will offer you their vast knowledge of the soft serve custards as well as...samplings of the variety of custards and Italian ices.  S'mores is currently my favorite, we'll wait that black soft serve sesame something is quite tasty.  Toppings, sauces, Italian ice choices and custards- combined!
Don't wait for recess, make a point and go inside Recess and have some tastings and go ahead, try an Italian Ice and custard combo please:)
Busy, busy, busy. 

For lunch, this location is packed like a mall on Christmas eve, especially considering the location is fairly tucked away. 

With this amount of turnover, the food is fresh and pretty good.  I wouldn't say the meat is substantially better than other schwarma places in the area, such as Pita & Grill, nothing that blows me away.  The portions of the sandwich are also pretty small.

The best thing is probably the pita bread, which is really fresh and is all puffy and steaming when it gets to your table. 

The hummus is creamier than most other places.

Garlic sauce is alright, but I think the one at Pita & Grill up the street is better.

I think this place is a bit overpriced, ($11 + tax for a chicken schwarma plate, I've uploaded a pic of their price list) for what you get compared to other schwarma places. 

Overall, the place is good. I don't mind going, but I do think the rating on Yelp is a bit high for the quality and price of food, but that's just my opinion, to each his own :)
We had our issues with delivery from this location before and I've sworn up and down to NEVER order Pizza Hut again but here we are ... today we order 2 large pizza and 1 order of garlic bread and pizzas were pretty basic believe it or not ! The email confirm received showed delivery to be expected by 650pm yes I know this is an estimate and after numerous calls to the store and being reassured the driver was on his way pizza finally arrived at 750pm 1 whole hour after the estimated time !! Needless to say we sent the driver away with our cold order and took the alternate to feed the STARVING children. HORRIBLE SERVICE I promise this time will definitely be the last time I swear !!!
Course was beautiful! Just played and the greens were so true. If I could play this course everyday, I would. Service, value, pace of play are 5 star!
This use to be my go to pho place. After several visits with poor service and charging me for a take out box, I no longer go there. I prefer Nam at Leslie and 16th, Little Saigon at Yonge and Weldrick, or Mr Pho which recently opened.
Busy on the morning I was there.  Prompt service.  Ordered pancakes.  Very good.  Bacon and eggs.   All as I wanted.  Delicious.   Went home and back to bed.  Solid breakfast spot.
Great experiences up until today. Found hair in my food and told it would be compensated and they kept it on the bill (but did not communicate this until we asked). Bad attitude from the staff who didn't even try to explain anything.  Definitely won't be back and no, I've never nor would I ever put my own hair in my food to save $9.00. It's about doing the right thing the right way with your customers. We've recommended a few of our friends here and will be sharing our experience of how your staff handled this today. Really disappointed.

That said, really nice chef who's very proud of his food. Poor staff managing with bad attitude and poor communication, you should be ashamed. All over a bowl of pho not even half finished!
Just as good as the other location I've been to here in town!  This one is actually closer to me, so it wins awesomeness points just for that.  The prices are a bit on the high side, but the food is delicious and healthy, so I say it's worth it.  It's hard to find healthy "fast food" but this definitely qualifies.  And it's right off the 215, so if you have 15-20 minutes to spare and want to grab something good for you, I highly recommend this place.
best breakfast, great prices, nice people, can be packed at main breakfast times. crazy cinnabun things. but best breakfast in avondale for sure!
Definitely ALTERNATIVE. Came here as part of an Yelp event and saw a free screening of Dale and Tucker vs. Evil. The genre is horror comedy and the movie was hilarious!  OMG, my hubby and I could not stop laughing throughout the movie along with everyone else in the theatre. The script was perfectly written and the actors perfectly casted. Def. 5 stars for the movie. 
Also 5 stars for the space and the staff. Very cool, laid back feel, a space you can come hang out and people watch. 
The theatre is intimate, with only 48 seats. Tickets at a little over $8 per show don't seem to be able to generate a lot of $$ so when you go see shows there, make sure you buy a lot of snacks to show support for this place cause it's such a cool place, I really hope it gets a following and becomes really popular.
Been in here many times over the years. I wish they still had the dance hall saloon.

The Mexican restaurant Willy and Jose's is awesome. 

If you need to buy yourself some western garb this is a great place to do it at.

Nice movie theater here.

I've spent a night or two here and have never had any complaints with their rooms.
My boyfriend really wanted to go here because of he thought the theme was cool and that it would be fun. Well it turned out to be the opposite. Yes it was funny to sit in a hospital gown, but unless you were there for jello shots and hard core drinking, the waitresses wouldn't pay any attention to you. It took us 15 minutes to get our drink order and then longer to get our actual order. I just got a single burger and fries and let me tell you after eating that "food" i wanted to vomit. 

The fries were rock hard and not good at all for something fried in lard. The burger might have been okay if the chili wasn't on it because it tasted like powdered chili (aka vomit). Definitely not quality food and they make their money off the atmosphere. I couldn't  even finish my food, so my boyfriend had so shove it down so I didn't get spanked. But we COULD NOT finish those gross fries. Didn't get a spanking because it was clear how upset we were. As the slow service theme continued to get our check, we walked out of there with that burger sitting in our stomach's for hours.
Solid bubble tea place. 

Their menu is so expansive it's always awkward standing there reading the whole thing while the person taking your order politely waits haha. They're always quick to give suggestions and help out thank goodness. 

If you're a rookie like me try the Honey Green tea with coconut jelly. it was the latest combo and my favourite so far.

It's important to note that chatime is GREAT for the winter too. You'd think that it's a summer time beverage place but on man their warm tea is just as fantastic! I would strongly recommend the same Honey Green tea with tapioca! You might be confused that they give you a straw but that's okay. Have no fear the tea is the right temperature to drink with a straw!
Get a mani\/pedi while getting fantastic lashes?! How awesome is that! Sherri does my lashes super long and Full and Amazingggg.  Love her.  Love this place :)
Hmmm.....I'm not sure how someone thinks everything is so fresh and new looking - because I'm not too impressed with this gym.  I will tell you though, it's never crowded!  

I joined because of the pool (which I have yet to use).  The women's locker room is bare boned compared to other gyms in the area I've been to, with signs all over about not leaving your valuables unlocked.  Sounds safe, right?  I haven't used too many weight machines but the cardio ones are decent, although some seem worn down and several are usually broken at any given time.  There are hardly any group exercise classes offered, so I haven't had a chance to try those out either.  

The staff is pretty friendly, and there is usually a decent selection of magazines available....so there are your two stars.  I can't imagine being a member here for long.
I've used Carol's mobile notary several times and have been very pleased. She's mobile, professional, and her fees are very reasonable. I highly recommend her.
Tu t'ennuis de magasiner en solde au boxing day, après que l'été soit fini ou l'hiver? Tu n'aimes pas les ventes trottoirs, mais tu veux des soldes? Tu n'as pas de voiture pour aller dans les Outlet du shore ??? Tu trouves que St-Hubert c'est trop ratchet, mais tu veux garder un peu de dignité en magasinant quand même en solde?

Alors voici ta place préférée, LA PLACE VERSAILLES!! Des soldes partout partout! Et des soldes de magasins connus. C'est comme le outlet des galeries d'anjou. Ils ont un superbe animalerie qui vaut le détour! 

Je donne 3*, car le foodcourt est un peu poche, pas assez de resto et l'écran de fausse cascade dans le foodcort est vraiment laide...
PIZZA BAR IN WAXHAW!!   If any of you are imports from other cities..you know that pizza is lacking down south! Well friend...go to the Harris Teeter in Waxhaw and try the Pizza..It is rolled out fresh everyday. Cooked to order and those girls will bend over backwards to make it just how you like it...Shallon and Shannon and Gina..they are the best Pizza makers in all the Harris Teeters!  The ovens only hold TWO at a time so its best to call your order in. On Mondays ( know as Pizza Mondays) your large 16 inch Pizza is 7.99!! That is unheard of ..You cannot order a pizza that reasonable anywhere and also have it taste good!
         I say ..Give it a try!! Ciao!
Free video games ranging from classic to current. Plus amazing tribute themed cocktails & amazing food. I sure hope this place sticks around for a while. It's magical!
Dropped in for a quick snack around 12 noon on a Saturday. Awesome location on Mill and super cool views from the upstairs and balconies. If it was warmer we would have sat outside. 

Good service, good beers, and Southwest Spring Rolls. That's a 4 star experience anyday
We found ourselves once again  celebrating the holiday season with my husband's colleagues at the Industry Public House. My last review ranted raved about the service and the food, and I gave them a well deserved 5 stars, but we weren't as impressed this time. Not that anything was WRONG, but just not deserving that coveted 5 star rating. Our sever, while friendly, wasn't as good as who we had last year. We waited FOR EVER for just about everything.. food orders, drinks, boxes.. everything. He forgot to ring in one persons order and they sat there empty handed until we were all long finished our meals. I got the Brussel sprouts once again because last time I was hooked on them and anticipating my next opportunity to have them, and I was so terribly let down. They changed the way they make them, I guess, and it was such a disappointment. I truly just didn't like them.. and it was sad.  My husband wasn't crazy about his burger, he said the aoli was way over powering. He didn't eat more than half of it, which is not normal, haha. I mean, not to say we won't return, but I'm hoping that last time wasn't just a fluke.. we'll see what happens the next time we go, I guess.
Met up with some people for happy hour and had an OK time. 

First the Good: Their happy hour is 7 days a week! And the usual free chips and salsa! The decor is appropriate and they have TVs for watching sports. 

The Bad: its kinda just the same greasy Mexican food that everyone else offers. And even though they were showing sports, they had a Hockey game on the speakers, the game ended and they still kept the sound on, so we heard the boring after show and then they let it run for some fixing up cars show that almost put me to sleep. And last, the service was very polite but not very attentive, we found ourselves asking for things like water multiple times. And we had an exact party of 6 so they added a gratuity and never told us about it, we are pretty good tippers but it's kinda irritating when you try to slip another one in. 

Overall I would only go back if I were meeting up with someone there, I have a Valle Luna even closer to me and its the same place pretty much so, I have that to look forward to.
Not bad.  I can see why some liken it to a Mexican Whole Foods with low prices.  Definitely experiential shopping, with lots of fresh departments.  A tiny bit bewildering for someone not fluent in Spanish, but practically everything is labelled in English.

The fresh white corn tortillas I bought are really good.  Microwaved for a bit with a bit of the Cacique white shredded cheese blend  that I also picked up from there makes a nice mini quesadilla.

Unfortunately the cuatro something cheese danish looking thing I bought tasted a little stale (too crunchy) and the cream cheese filling was almost chewy (too thinly spread to retain creaminess, and\/or just stale).

For those who are wary: All the (albeit young) employees I talked to (bakery clerk, cashier) spoke fluent English.

Subtracting one star for the stale pastry and another for the neighborhood.
Love Dalton, Bryce, and fam! I wish I could spend more than 4 hours with you and your restaurant.Waittttt, I probably have! Xoxo!
This was our third visit to Thai 1 and the food didn't disappoint.....kinda! Half way thru our meal, my Bride noticed a live fly in her dinner. Needless to say, it interrupted our meal. But that's when the entertainment began!

Our waitress said she wouldn't charge us for the fly and removed the meal. We assume to replace the meal. She did return, within 2 minutes, with what she said was a child's portion but assured us it was a fresh meal. Funny thing is she never returned to our table.

Another waitress, also part of the comedy team, cleared our table and brought our check, which included both meals. When I mentioned the live fly she responded, "see even the fly wants to enjoy our food"! 

While the meals cost wasn't significant enough to debate with a skilled comedy team, I was a bit taken by their flippant attitude. So I asked if she really expected me to pay for a meal with a live insect in it. 

The comedy routine continued, as she asked, "was you meal served with the fly or did it enter during the meal?". I suspect my facial expression reflected my displeasure. 

She begrudgingly removed the meal from our check but couldn't resist one final joke, drawing our attention to an open door,  with a chair strategically placed, to assure the staff easy access to the outdoor seating. "See, that where the fly came from, not the kitchen"! I couldn't help but wonder if the open door was part of a health code?

Next time your craving Thai food and live comedy, I suggest Thai 1st Bistro! Good humor and free fresh protein!
Basically I have been here two times, both for waxing, so that is all I am commenting on. Both times I have gone because my normal waxer has been MIA and this place is conveniently close. That said, I find it very expensive, especially for what you get. The first time I went I got the works done...legs, bikini, underarms, etc. The person doing the waxing was very pleasant and kept the conversation going, which I appreciated, but I was still red for DAYS, something I have rarely experienced before in years of waxing. That said, she got the job done. 
Today, however, I had a different girl, who was also very pleasant, but it wasn't until I got home, that I realized what a shoddy job she had done. Patches of hair are still there. I pretty much have to get this redone and I had to pay more to go to this place than any other place I've been to + tip! 
Not only that, but the facility for waxing is pretty pitiful. It's a VERY small room, with the "bed" pushed up against a wall. When I went in the summer it was very warm, so I'm not sure if there are A\/C or not. The other wall is entirely windows, which of course always have the blinds closed. It's a weirdly appointed room for a waxing area. Perhaps it was originally a storage closet? With windows?? I don't know, but it's not as though you're going here and paying more because the atmosphere is so much nicer! Anyway, as I said, this place is used in a pinch and now, I'm not sure I'd bother using it for that either!
I love this place! They sure know about tires. Great staff. VASSIE is the greatest! go see him if you have any questions. He's very knowledable and extremely friendly. I won't take my car anywhere else!!  Reasonable prices also!!
This place is awesome! Had a fun time with friends I had not seen in a while. The food was excellent, the drinks were cold and made to order!  The staff was fast and courteous!  I highly recommend this place! I can't wait to go back! Too bad there is not a 10 stat rating!
There are some Pros and some Cons to this Metro relative to the upstairs Sobeys:

Pros:
- 24 Hours
- Larger product range, bigger store
- Generally better prices
- Can sometimes get reduced-price produce 

Cons:
-Does not offer 10% student discount, which the Sobeys upstairs does as does the nearby Metro at Church and Gould
- Cashiers are slower and tend to not be as friendly, so you often have to wait a long time to check out, especially during rush times (lunch, 4-6pm)
Trash. Absolute trash.  I'd give it no stars if I could.

It looks nice on the surface. The staff seems to be friendly, and will do everything they can to help you move in... But once they have you in contract, all bets are off. They treat you as less than dirt, and you will suddenly find dozens of Hidden Fees popping up after your first month's bill. 

If  you are reading this review and are thinking to yourself. "Oh, this guy just has sour grapes," Well, think again. I was a model renter, I always paid my rent on time. and only complained when my apartment was full of roaches and the tub was leaking all over the floor after a few days of living there... Not that it did any good. They never fixed any of it.

Vista valley has a vast majority of negative reviews on other sites like Apartment Ratings, A bad experience is the norm with this company. 
Do yourself a favor and believe me when I say this complex is garbage.
Lili is a new fave for my "caffeinated lunch" fix. Great little selection of sandwiches - I love the vegan Banh Mi(!) and the tempeh reuben is good too. Sandwiches come with pickles on the side; major plus! They play excellent music (I wouldn't expect anything less with Mind Cure up above to curate the selections) and the shop is generally hip, but not in an exclusive way. Rather, it exudes a rad community vibe that you will either want to be a part of or feel repelled by because of your inability to feel comfortable in a genuinely cool place. Disclaimer: nobody is going to befriend you just for walking in the door and you might get a sunburn if you sit on the patio on a sunny day.
Jim and his team are GREAT! I've purchased many items over the past 5 years, some off the shelf and other custom designs and every time they were available when I needed them and exactly to my specification! Thank Inspired LED!
Not a fan.  Parking is confusing and hard to access. Packed with people.   Dark and unpleasant smell wafts throughout.  I would avoid this area entirely.
I met a group of friends here and decided to give this place a try. I ordered a salad that was very good! It had Bibb lettuce, pears, candied walnuts, blue cheese, with an apple cider vinegar salad dressing! The service was great and this is also a great place to hang out with friends because you can play pool or sit outside. This place has plenty of space!
I haven't been to Italy, but they claim it's "authentic" and they're certified based on a bunch of fancy smancy standards - well, all I can say is it's different from your regular pizza, and pretty darn good.

If you're a fan of Indian naan (I am) then you'll *love* this pizza. It's a soft, naan like crust that's toasted perfectly and the toppings are great.

Home made sausage, duck confit, mmmm... I wish there was more sausage though, I swear our pizza only had like 5 pieces of sausage on it.  It was basically a margherita :(

The duck confit pizza had plenty of duck, no complaints there. 

All in all, a great place to have a Pizza, will be back if I'm craving a pie in that area.

Pizzas run $12-15 I think.
One word....YUM! I had the buttermilk. It was amazing. I'm still thinking about it 12 hours later. Can't wait to stop in next time I'm in Glendale. Oh, and $5 for 6 delicious donuts - can't beat that!
I've been to my fair share of beer fests but never a Beer, Bourbon & BBQ fest. So imagine my excitement when I was able to get my hands on some VIP tickets! We showed up right around 12:00. There was a fairly long line of people wearing neon colored wrist bands. We got our ID's checked and we joined the line of thirsty patrons. In exchange for a small ticket, they hand you your sampling glass. About half the festival was laid out on the parking lot with the rest opening out to the park. It was a warmer day, so the shade that the trees provided were a welcome refuge. Many people brought their own blankets, folding chairs and some even had coolers. There were a few people with pretzel necklaces and even a guy in costume. Various vendor tents handing out swag filled in the spaces between sampling tents. Our fair city's CM was out there too! 

I'm glad that we were able to get the VIP tickets for the extra hours (12-2) before the general admission crowd is let in. The lines grew substantially after 2pm and vendors had already run out of things by then (like the high end bourbon table). If you want to beat the crowds and have the full gamut of choices, spend the extra $10 on the VIP tickets. 

So, why three stars you may ask? My biggest complaint mirrors that of Mac K's, how are you going to call a festival Beer, Bourbon and BBQ and only represent two of three things... There was plenty of beer & bourbon (and other spirits) but there were only two BBQ vendors (Queen City Q and one I don't remember the name of) and no samples. Luckily, they offered re-entry and you could just walk over to the mall for more food options (and bathrooms & air conditioning!). If you are a beer and bourbon fan, it's worth attending. I just wasn't wowed enough to pay the ticket price for next year.
But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks, it is the east and Purslane is my sun! 

It was a beautiful sunny lunchtime when we came in here for lunch, and the sun carried on shining on my tastebuds as we had the two course lunch for 12 pounds. What great value for such great food!

We were made to feel very welcome, and the casual fine dining experience to me is all about relaxed good service with excellent quality food. The service was brilliant and it was clear everyone here is passionate about good food and making every trip here special.

I started with the smoked salmon blinis which was fresh, rich and beautifully presented. The pan fried hake was delicious and has to be up there as one of the best fish dishes I've had. I really did spend the whole afternoon afterwards finding myself just going 'hmmmmm' at the memory of it.

Unfortunately we were under a bit of time pressure, so I'm already planning a return visit with some more time to enjoy a leisurely lunch or dinner at what is now my top picks  Edinburgh restaurant.

And the best thing? You get a QR code on a card with your bill that allows you to go and buy Paul and other excellent Edinburgh chefs recipes, so you can recreate the fine dining experience at home with friends and family. What a fantastic idea! I've already cooked the roast rump of lamb with a herb crust for some friends. 

But it won't be stopping me coming back for the real experience of being so wrapped in the sunshine of service and taste that is Purslane.
All you can eat sushi bar..... We sat at the bar talked to the chefs...you can order whatever you want as much as you want of anything on the menu for only $25, seems like the greatest deal ever but of course it's Las Vegas. I didn't have anything that wasn't fantastic!
Its not Tacos El Gordo!! I came to this location twice, first time it was good enough for us not to make the drive to Tacos El Gordo for a fix. But the second time (which was on the same week) just failed. The lady at the burrito area was talking crap in spanish calling us stupid and mentally slow. Now this is all due to a warmed up tortilla that she had to throw away. We ordered two burritos, when she was done making the first i politely asked to change the order to carne asada fries. Thats when she started talking crap and didn't realize i understood her. So everyone was laughing at us and then i ordered two tacos, one seso and one cabeza. The guy tells me just pay your order and ill get it to you. Both tacos smelled rancid and tasted old. I didn't touch it after that. 

Whats really terrible about this is that it all started by that this older lady at the burrito area named Veronica who had to throw away a warmed up tortilla and the fact that it only took a thrown warmed tortilla too intentionally try to give you food poisoning. 

This experience is at the Tropicana location. Well were never coming here again. Unfortunately, we wont even try the other location.
2 stars = Meh. I've experienced better. Fact is I've experienced WAY better. 

Z-teca gets 2 stars because the ingredients seem very fresh and for burritos they do press\/grill them at the end (a technique sadly missed at many burrito joints).

Other than that the actual flavours are lacking all around. As my husband calls it, there's an overriding 'tang' that can't be ignored and sours the rest of the dish. I went for a chicken burrito bowl yesterday and although I left feeling light (these aren't the one pounders you get elsewhere), I still highly regretted my lunch decision. 

Go to Burrito Bandidos.
The Steak bomb was bomb but the fry's taste like they been sitting out forever.  We ordered it take out though.
I love that you can choose two flavors for a small!

Peppermint patty was very tasty and I love the dark chocolate peppermint combo.  Too bad it didn't have little York patties mixed in.

The Grasshopper was also very good, and is basically mint chip with crushed Oreos mixed in.  It's definitely the sweeter of the two.

The waffle cone chip was a tad stale and very unimpressive.

With only two workers for the night crowd, I didn't feel like it was prudent (now was I encouraged) to ask for any flavor samples.

Like most gelato places, it's a little pricey for what you get.  A "just right" small was $3.60 ($3.89 after tax).

I'd definitely come back if I was in the neighborhood though!
Really great food and service. Came during lunch time with two other moms and their children. The restaurant totally accommodated us with our big ole strollers and crazy toddlers. Food was excellent. I will definitely return!
Baked ricotta and honey is quite tasty!  Now, let's talk about the service. We sat a the bar this evening and CHELSEA!  She's attentive, friendly and a wonderful personality. Servers in this town should take a lesson from Chelsea:)
Hands down the most relaxing day ever! I booked aromatherapy massages for my husband and I during his birthday getaway. We arrived a bit early to get in a quick workout before and, looking back, I wish we would have arrived earlier. There are so many amenities! The plush robes, women's lounge and jacuzzi, pina coladas by the outdoor pool... We're already booked to return next month.

HIGHLY recommend!
If I could eat a southwestern Caesar salad once a day, every day, I think I would. This is one of my favorite salads...ever. Paradise in general is a little overpriced but one in a while, I'll bite the bullet and splurge. My only complaint is their lack of vegetarian options. For a restaurant that specializes in soups, salads and sandwiches, it would make sense to have more than one or two options in each category suitable for veggies.
I've got some spunky glasses that try to go on adventures without me. I turn my head too quick, they take that as a cue to flap their little arms and fly off my head. I bend down to tie my shoe, they hurry to the tip of my nose for a better view. I fall asleep in them, and I'm not sure what kind of antics they get into, but I usually find them in disarray on the ground or tangled in the blankets. Maybe they just wanted to cuddle, but I'm pretty sure they're conspiring to elope to Vegas without me. 

But they're creatures of habit, so it's not too often they pull a fast one on me. (Although every time they do I'm sure they giggle their lenses off as I grope for them like a blind mole-like critter.) They recently hatched a new plan, easily the most devious of the bunch. Instead of working as a team they decided to take their chances solo and rendezvous at a meeting point. That meeting point happened to be my bathroom counter.

I set them down and *plop* what was once one piece was then two. I was so shocked that I conceded a good couple of days to them. Especially since they were willing to go to such extremes to get away from me! While they gloated over their victory I was stuck with my highly unflattering, scratched and cruddy Harry Potter glasses.

After a brief hiatus they agreed to reconcile for the sake of my nose (and my ego). So off to All-American Eyeglass Repair we went! We showed up and were promptly greeted by a young man at the counter. My glasses warmed to him immediately and I could practically hear them purring with contentment. It was an ocular spa day. 

He took my wily little friends into the back (gave 'em a quick massage), popped in a new screw (the happy ending on that massage), then tightened and re-bent (lil chiropractic work) them back into shape. 

Total cost: zero dollars and zero cents. 

My glasses must have sweet talked him while they were in the back because his only requirement was that we come back to him for all our glasses repair needs. Seeing how this is the first time in years these glasses have sat quietly in one place for longer than thirty minutes, I'm pretty sure they've put the revolution on the back burner. But the next time they start conniving, it's off to All-American Eyeglass Repair for a visit to my favorite lens masseuse!
It's our first time here at the restaurant and so far they have the friendly service, esp our server idk her name but yeah, I got myself bento box and it's good, my bf got the customized ramen like when you choose what you want and he said it's pretty awesome but they do forgot to put the eggs on his ramen but then that's fine I'm not going to deduct a star because of it coz it was solve anyways and they apologized anyways. Experience so far was good I'll come back to this place !
I am happy to report that I was able to eat breakfast here recently and it was a great experience. Our server was great and compared to other reviews, I felt the service was fairly quick. We were initially told that there was a ten minute wait and ended up waiting for about 25-30 minutes...certainly not a deal breaker. 

Our food was wonderful. We split an order of french toast and the garlic mushroom scramble. Both were delicious but I could go on and on about the scramble...the sauce on it was savory, rich and the perfect topping for eggs. My orange juice was not that great this time--it was pretty sour but that could be a fluke because the last time we were here my OJ was superb and definitely worth the money. 

As I said before, a big draw to this restaurant for us is the fact that they are dog friendly. Even on a chilly morning, the patio (equipped with heat lamps) makes for a fun family outing with our pooch.
I'm on a mission for two items, rush in, grab and go. 
NOPE. 
Listen, if you can do that in Target please do an intervention and show me the way.
I'm always going in and talking with myself.  No, I don't answer myself back so that's good;). I tell
Myself, oh just quickly peruse blah, blah department. Absolutely fails.  Find me later on, after I peruse the entire store, filled a hand basket and then upgraded into a full size red bullseye cart. 
I do this
Every
Single
Time.
It's clean and they encourage you in being clean as well.  How so, notice the wipes every few aisles, along with a trash bin, and phone.  No, don't be ridiculous that phone does not make long distance calls.  Geez!  It's for NOT locating an employee, pick it up and they come to you!  Genius, no bullseye!  Target will price match, and obtain a Target red card please.  They have a credit one and a debit one. Five percent off and they stack coupons and stack again with that cartwheel app.
I heart Target!
The cost of a pedicure and exfoliation here simply were not worth it!  While the lady did a thorough job during the massage and exfoliating, she tore at my heels a bit too much and they are still very tender days later.  The pedicure itself was just average; might look better than I could have done, but not as good as most places.  I'll keep looking for a different salon.
Absolute garbage! Asked for NO TURNIPS, got extra turnips, ordered a fantastic grape, got coke. In the cans. How that got mixed I don't know. Below room temp kebabs, room temp shawarma and room temp samosas. The service was rude and horrible. Only got attitude about the food not being warm enough for consumption and the turnip thing. Avoid this place. No idea how it's even open.
Wow, I love this place!  I've been to one of the other Sambalatte locations in town, but I like this one better.  The upstairs with recliners and little tea tables just adds to the cozy appeal.  Their teas (I've now tried three different kinds) are all great, and my friend - who had the hot chocolate - said that was delicious, as well.   Their Christmas decorations that were up when I went were also adorable and pretty.  Look forward to coming back here, and maybe exploring Boca Park a little more, as well...
I discovered Buldogis from one of the Las Vegas Foodie Festival that I attended a few years back. I fell in love with them right away. I have tried other hotdog trucks before but Buldogis have my heart because of their Asian\/Hawaiian twists to it. 

We were in their Sahara location so we gave them a try. They offer a lot of other food on their menu now including the Hangover Soup. I might come back sooner just to try one of their burgers too. Three things that we ordered: 

#1 - Bulgogi Hotdog    3.5\/5
#2 - Ban Mi Hotdog       5\/5
#3 - Hawaiian Hotdog  5\/5

I liked all of the things that we ordered. I personally loved the Hawaiian dog. It came with a pineapple salsa which was tangy which blended so perfectly with the saltiness of the hotdog. The crispy pork belly was a plus. I love me some fatty pork! 

I will definitely come back to try other items in their menu. Especially the burgers, they all sounded so interesting!
Ordered the large turkey tom dinner  (16-18lbs) with yams, potatoes and corn. Picked it up and opened the box to find a small dry 10lb turkey, no yams, no stuffing. 

I called to let them know and was told they ran out of yams but can substitute for more gravy or something? Well what about this turkey? I paid for the large one and now stuck with this dinky turkey. 

Brought the dinky turkey back to the store and the manager said that I was given the wrong turkey, he proceeded to the back to grab a larger turkey. He apologized and he said that the workers were just putting whatever in the boxes to get people their orders. Ok that makes me feel a lot better. Not ordering here again.
Amazing vermacelli, the best in toronto in my opinion. Clean food nice atmosphere. Its always a treat to come here
Not so much tex-mex as it is authentic regional Mexican cuisine, Cantina is a welcome treat in Charlotte.  Coming from California where traditional Mexican is common and delicious, I was a little disappointed in Mexican fare here - until I found Cantina 1511.  I'll definitely be back!
I've been coming here for my homey japanese food cravings in the last 2 years. The first time I came, I was very satisfied with the authentic taste. However, lately I have been noticing the smaller portion and the change in taste. This is most noticeable in the curry. Gone was the dark brown umami curry due to beef stock. Now, the curry is very bland if eaten with rice because they change the beef stock with water. Will I come again? Honestly I don't know. With the same price and the diluted curry, I might as well go up north to J-Town for a one day trip and have real homey japanese food.
We have been patrons of Pet Club for quite some time. If I'm in a pinch, I'll suck it up and head to Petsmart...but this store is worth the trip when I need to make my big purchases. Being that both of our pets are on a holistic and grain-free diet, Pet Club is an obvious choice for their food needs. They carry a wide variety of foods that are difficult to find in the big chains. At the risk of sounds like a pet-owning snob, I appreciate that these stores carry plenty of foods that don't include the yucky stuff most people don't want to know is in their pet's food. The employees are knowledgeable about the products they carry and the items are reasonably priced.
Lots of reviews on this place and we were really excited to eat here. We got the oxtail,  jerk chicken and chicken soup.  Oxtail - soft and succulent but we only got a small portion with a ton of rice. Jerk chick -  disappointed. It looked and smelled amazing but was dry. Soup -  not bad but I've had better.  I think for the price you pay, there should be a larger portion of protein.  Really friendly staff though and I wish I had a better review to give.
Mexico sure is a long way from Wisconsin, and I walked into Abuleo's with a certain amount of resignation that it was probably going to be a bad meal.  Well, I got a pleasant surprise and Abuleo's gets a solid 3 stars because I really liked my food.  The dip trio is a combination of 2 warm dips (cheese and chili & cheese) and 1 chilled avocado dip.  For some reason, our group of 5 stuck the dips right in front of me with the idea that table would share, but I kept eating the dips during the entire meal because all 3 tasted great with chips.

I also got the fajita tacos with steak, and the meat was tender and flavorful.  It kind of doesn't matter whether or not mashed potatoes are a Mexican side dish - they were good!  My plate also came with a scoop of guacamole and lettuce & tomato that you almost eat like a salad.  The genius is in the details, though, and the cooks really had their thinking caps on when they did this.  Check it out: my flour tortillas and the warm steak filling would get cold fast if touching a cold plate.  So my soft tacos were sitting on top of a room temperature corn tostada, held in place by a small dab of beans on the plate.  The first time I had ever this, and yet so clever.

I didn't have room for dessert, but if I did, I would have gotten the chocolate explosion.  One person was hoping that it wouldn't come out on the receipt that way, since we have to submit copies of everything in order to get reimbursed, but sure enough it said "chocolate explosion."  She got her dessert to-go, and the next day we teased her and asked whether any chocolate explosion got on her hotel room walls or ceiling.  That question was met with silence.
Just finished enjoying our awesome meatball pizza.   We love Brothers. We used to live in the southwest part of town and we were so happy to find they had a location near our new house. They are always friendly on the phone and our delivery was on time and a super nice driver!
PopPhysique is offering free classes during their first week open so I decided to go to a class at lunchtime on Monday. The studio is located on the second floor of Delisle Court where a restaurant used to be. It is still currently under renovations, so it was quite dusty and only one (of two) bathrooms was functioning and neither of the two shower stalls were open. 

The studio itself was quite nice and clean, but I do have some complaints. The first being that one wall is all windows to the outside with a bar set up along the windows, if you're unfortunate (like me) and end up at the bar along the window, it means you don't have access to a mirror to assess your position, etc. The instructor was nice and enthusiastic, but she described the positions verbally as she walked around and only sort of demonstrated the positions. When we were lying on our mats, it would have been nice if she had laid down at times too to demonstrate. At times I felt my muscles working hard and I remember thinking, "wow, I'll feel this tomorrow", but I don't feel it in my muscles today.

Will I go back? I don't think so. I get better workouts elsewhere, and I really don't think PopPhysique offers anything unique versus any of the other barre studios in the city.
When you were a kid and first learned about the concept of fine dining, this restaurant is probably what you imagined in your mind. Lots of modern fine dining places feel a bit understated - Benu, the French Laundry, Quince, and Saison all come to mind - in their service and interiors, as if to suggest that all of your attention should be on the food. You will not feel that way at all walking into this revered establishment. If Louis XIV had a dining room from Versailles transported into the modern era this is what it might feel like. Bold purple and white colors dominate the main dining space with a tasteful ivy wall serving for contrast against the far wall - the interior broadcasts luxury before you even walk into the space.

I've been fortunate enough to dine here on multiple occasions and every element of the restaurant is best-in-class. Don't believe anyone who think this place has fallen out favor or changed, it is still the best place to eat in all of Las Vegas.

There are a number of food options to choose from but c'mon, if you're here you're doing it wrong if you don't opt for the 16 course degustation menu. It's expensive but trust me, it's worth it. Obviously the menu shifts various dishes in and out but some delicious regulars include La Langoustine, a remarkable lobster ravioli, an amazing preperation of the classic French scallop dish La Noix De Saint-Jacques (I've never had better), and the real star of the show, Le Caviar, a trio of the finest caviar dishes; even if you're not a caviar fan I guarantee this dish will change your mind entirely. The night begins with and is complimented with an over-the-top bread cart full of every kind of freshly baked bread you can imagine but the true piece de resistance as it relates to American palettes is the bacon bread - trust me, you'll want many of these before your meal is over.

I know the image I painted of this place is of an extremely classy fine dining restaurant and that can be intimidating to some. While it most certainly is that they also go out of their way to make each and every guest here feel amazing. Instead of feeling like you are out of place in a luxury fine  dining restaurant the staff do everything they can from the moment you walk in until the moment you leave to make your experience be as memorable and great as it can be.

Highly recommended.
This is one if the best 24 hour fitness in the Phoenix area. It is clean machines r not worn out, staff friendly and it's never busy. Great place to work out!!!
I have been waiting so long for my In and Out burger. I have been hearing about this West coast chain for ages. Everyone talks about how GREAT it is - "It's the best burger in the world" - "You will never have such as good burger in your life" - "I travel to the West coast just for this burger." So when I found out that there was one a couple of blocks away from the convention center I was working in, I was beyond ecstatic. I just had to get there. So I dragged two of my co-workers to In and Out to grab a "burger and fries". It was amazing. Out of this world. The best burger I ever had. Etc. Etc. Other than that, I really can't say much. If you never had it - You NEED\/HAVE to experience it. If you had - you don't need any other explanation. It's just that good!
Stayed here June 2012.  Nice rooms, clean and comfortable.  However, the hallways smelled horrible...like dog food and fish combined.  It was gross!  Front desk staff was helpful in finding places to eat within walking distance.  Pool was clean.  Would stay there again.
Back to Ilios....only to be just as happy as the last time I was there...They do EVERYTHING right....So Good..Zucchini and Eggplant Fritters, Perfect, Fig and Prosciutto Flatbread, Perfect, And the Calamari is the Best in Charlotte!...Today was just a quick lunch but their Cocktails are outstanding too.   If you haven't been in a while...GO! I am telling you!!
I bought a car back in March and Sam is the best. Definitely ask for him he was nothing but accommodating, patient and kind. ask for Sam sorice or sorrice! He will deff take care of you(:
What can you say about the good old Memorial Union and Terrace of the University of Wisconsin - Madison. It is spectacular YEAR ROUND! You head on into the Der Rathskeller for a beer and maybe a burger during the winter and it is just a warming place. In the spring and summer it makes you feel like it is summer! It is great! Then there is the terrace in back on the lake. During the summer they have live music for free and of course a little beer and brat station! IT is fantastic! Being from Madison, this is my absolute favorite place to hang out during the summer, grab some friends and just sit down there and relax, talk about life, goals, downers, everything! It can get a little busy but that just means it is an amazing place right?! Anyone and everyone should have the privilege of going here for a night and see if they don't return a hundred times more. Walk along the lake a bit, watch the water and the majestic scenery that is Lake Mendota and Madison, WI while sipping an ice cold beer on a warm summer night.... Wow, I am missing it like crazy just writing about it!
Love this place normally, but they closed 15 mins early today. 2\/28\/2015 totally lame like 3 other people pulled up around the same time as we did and couldn't get in.
I had a craving for fish and chips because my brother had brought some home the night before. He opened up the box and we're pretty big eaters so any place that only gives one piece of fish we complain. So the next day I thought I'd give it a try. 
I ride my bicycle over and ordered the Ackroyd. The order took a little while to prepare so if it's really busy be prepared to wait a bit. I felt bad I didn't leave a tip but it's my first time trying out the place and don't believe in tips until I've had it 2-3 times and they're consistent. I opened up the box by the beach and I already knew what to expect. I took my first bite of the fish and man was it tasty! The batter was delicious and the tartar sauce nice and light. The fish was tender, not too chewy and had a good taste.
The French fries. I usually prefer my fries cut as shoestring and seeing how big these were I was a little disappointed. I popped one in my mouth and these were some darn good fries. Crispy outside and nice on the inside. Lightly salted and then I proceeded to do something stupid. I put vinegar on them and it ruined the fries crispness. 
Coleslaw. Not something I look forward to but even their coleslaw was good! Just the right amount of tanginess in the dressing and the green onion complimented it nicely.
I gave a 4 star because it was only my first time there. In the future given consistency in their food it could be 5.
If you're a fan of fish and chips it's definitely worth a try. Even if you're not, this place has lots of potential.
I really love how clean it is here, they use fresh implements, the floor is clean, they line there bowls, and my girl did a wonderful job on my toes. I'll definitely return! The prices are fair as well!. The massage as well was amazing. Super pleased!
Heard about this restaurant from a friend and heard it took awhile to get the order since they make your food right away after you order.  So I decided to order over the Sharwarma Plate and the Koobideh combo over the phone.  They told me it takes about 15 minutes when I ordered the food.  I left my house after about 5-10 minutes and when I arrived the food was ready as they had promised.  Service was great, and the food was delicious. Lots of creamy sauce to go with the chicken shawarma plate, and the koobideh skewers were marinated to perfection!. I would definitely come back for more soon.
Jersey Mike's employees are just cool. You walk in and they greet you like they know you. The food was good too. They slice the meat fresh and fix up you sub however you'd like. The cheese steak was pretty bangin'. Warning: The parking situation just sucks in this area. They have a small lot but it was jam packed.
This place is now my favorite spot in Charlotte for Indian food, hands down. It's a newly built restaurant with plenty of room inside in there dining space and bar area. The wait staff were extremely nice and helpful. 

The food was great and the menu has plenty to choose from. The Gobi Manchurian was our favorite!! Everyone should try it. No, you have to try it!!

Great place and great authentic Indian food!!
I've only been here once, but it was excellent.

I had an extremely succulent order of crab legs with butter.  They were outstanding.  I also shared some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever had in my life!

I pondered dinging them a star on price, but you get what you pay for.  Know going into this place that it's an expensive steakhouse.  Disclaimer: I wasn't the one paying for the meal when I dined here.

The lighting was dim, and I could see this place being very romantic for special occasions.

If you plan to stay more than the two hour limit in the pay parking, just park in the free lot or garage behind Saks and Macy's.  Or just valet it if paying a little doesn't matter to you.
Some people go to car dealerships to gawk at new vehicles. Others window shop at their favorite department store. I myself prefer to frequent Williams Sonoma and try my best to keep from drooling all over the Le Creuset line. If I'm feeling really dangerous, I will hit this place up during one of their sales. This store has great customer service and the staff is very knowledgeable about the products they sell. With kitchenware, you get what you pay for. Believe me when I say you will not regret your decision to spend a bit more money on a much better product. If I could give this store any negative feedback it would be that is is highly addictive. Warning--once you enter, you are sure to return :)
I thought Tidy's Flowers had a great reputation as a florist, but I guess I was wrong!

For Valentine's Day my boyfriend had ordered roses with Tidy's. However, the flowers that were delivered was not what he had ordered. He had placed in an order for long stem roses, mixed with orchids and was charged for that. What had showed up was a small vase with 4 short cut roses and some greens - table ornament, not really Valentine's Day flowers. 

In speaking with another friend, something similar happened to her - her fiancee had ordered a dozen of roses for her for Valentine's Day while he was in Germany as a surprise and they never showed up. So when he called them to complaint, they actually then called up my friend to confirm whether or not she had received the flowers. Which she didn't, so they said they would resend - only to have them deliver it to the wrong place.

Understanding that Valentine's Day is the most busiest day for florists and mistakes do happen, the way they had handled it was not what would have been expected from a florist of that nature.
I visited today for the second time and feel like the vibe here is perfect. The people who run this shop are friendly and made me feel welcome as I sat at the counter where a cool yellow phone from another era (i.e. 80s or earlier) sat. I ordered the dark sourdough with goat cheese ($5 for two thick slices with ample amounts of goat cheese slathered on each). It was delicious, filling and reminded me of similar cuisine I had at a museum restaurant in another city recently.
I tried out this place after reading the good reviews on yelp while looking for an AYCE.

I was terribly dissappointed by everything at the restaurant. 

For starters, there was food under my chair that got onto my clothes which was absolutely disgusting. The food was poor quality; oily tempura, sloppy sushi rolls and undercooked spring rolls. The service was really brusque and would just run by dropping your plate as they continued along the way. 

When we went to pay, the woman at the cashier even reminded us that tip isn't included in the bill which I'm sure anyone from the continent is well aware of. A terrible business practice and also just plain rude!

Overall, I would really not recommend the restaurant. The food was terrible quality, the service was bad and the place wasn't too clean.
Ordered two chili cheese dogs with a combo. The food was OK. Service was a little rough. Older lady behind the counter was semi rude and had a very bad smokers hack that she wasn't trying to hide. The lady that prepared my hot dogs was standing in food prep area holding a baby.  Im just hoping I dont get sick. I will post back if so. I expect a little more of a tight ship when it comes to food safety procedures at a place like DQ. That reason alone was why I didnt go to the mom and pop stand down the street.
Great bar food here and small but decent selection of beer.  It's pretty smoky in here though. Not sure why they continue to allow children in even though they have a 21 and over sign. There are kids in there every time. They should remodel if they want to be a family friendly place and care about their guests.
I am updating with 5 stars for the programming and for my love of the Arts. 
And 3 stars for having long rows with no breaks in them for traffic flow. 
My son and I were there 2 nights ago where we saw the best of the state high schoolers perform in an orchestra. The highs schoolers were terrific. And the conductor connected great with the audience. 
My 8 yr old son was my date and we sat smack in the middle of this very, very, very long row. Then he had to go to the bathroom. We had no choice but to interrupt the patrons again and again and again and again . . . You get the idea. Everyone was very nice about it. That's the good part. The other good part was even after saying what felt like a hundred excuse me's my son, thankfully made it to the bathroom in time!
As a local restaurant down the block form me I only wish the best for them. When I order from on line menus it shows crunchy duck.  This is something I really think I would enjoy, but the restaurant tells me they no longer have a duck supplier. Ok guys then take the item out of your menus. I have tried other items only to find the food to be ok. Nothing I have to have every night it you know what I mean. Please get duck!  Thank you
BUYER BEWARE!!

If you want these snakes to rob you blind..then go for it!

We are currently having a problem with their financing department because they made a HUGE mistake and it is ending up costing me huge amounts of money.  We tried to contact their dealership on several occasions and got the same "run-around" with things like "Our system is down".  It got to the point that my husband and I ended up contacting Nissan Consumer Affairs and Nissan North America to get some kind of resolution.

I have had nothing but Nissan's since 1989.  We are pretty loyal to Nissan, but this will have to be the last Nissan we will own. I love the product, but the customer service behind it is ridiculous.  We will try to resolve this problem one more time, but if they do not fix their own mistake, I will have no other choice but to seek legal council and file a complaint with the BBB.  We have given them the opportunity to fix a problem at the lowest level possible, but they are doing nothing about it.

Cliff, their finance guy is a joke!  If you still do decide to purchase a vehicle from them, make sure you take your time and go over the contract and make sure your numbers add up.  Don't allow any of the finance staff be your "friend", because you are just a dollar sign to them and it is all about how much money they can get from you.

DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND DO NOT LET THEM FOOL YOU!

You are probably better off going to another dealership.  They are all independently owned; therefore, you might find a better deal and better service!
We stopped in here for dinner because it was very close to our hotel and we were able to be seated immediately. They have outdoor seating, which we chose since it was a nice evening. The seating its self was lacking. The staff was nice but not on top of their game. They did not come around often enough and made some errors.

I was feeling like something simple so I ordered the Breakfast Burro. It comes stuffed with scrambled eggs, green chiles, potatoes and cheddar cheese. I chose to add sausage. It was good sized, enough to fill me up. The flavor was a touch bland, but I was able to overcome that with some hot sauce.

This is not a bad place. If you are looking for affordable bar food, then it probably will be ok.
I walked in and asked to be seated on the patio. When I walked out on to the patio I noticed there were literally dogs out on the patio. Now I get why they call it Lazy Dog. Needless to say, I sat inside.

The food was just average pub food. Margarita Pizza, Fish Tacos, Fish & Chips, and Tofu Stir Fry. No need to go through each item. It was all average and over priced. The homemade ginger beer was good, but too sweet. I had to exchange it for an iced tea.

They have a cool bar with quite a few beers on draft. They also have a happy hour menu and the margaritas look good. I will probably be back to have a drink at the bar, but the food did not impress
Overall, the gym is good compared to many others, been to LVAC and EOS and I keep coming back here because the environment elsewhere does not come close. 
Equipment: Would give 4 stars due to equipment being down for a long time, but when I ask when it's getting fixed, the employees have an answer for me for the most part. For example the Smith Machine has been down for a while, but they explained that the part they need is coming in December, so at least they have an answer. Other than that, there is a wide variety of equipment to use and it's never TOO crowded or busy so something you need is bound to be open. 
Personal trainers: of course it's their job to sell you packages, so they can be pushy, but even when you don't buy a package they still walk around and are supportive of other people exercising which I think is nice.
Cleanliness: is good enough, I have noticed the last month or so that employees are doing a better job cleaning. 
Wet Area: was recently re done and closed for over 2 months, but it's a very nice remodel, nothing too fancy but the sauna, steam room, and pool look clean and nice to use. 
Child care: my favorite part of the entire gym!! Reason why I'm giving 5 instead of 4 stars. The girls that work there are so nice and always welcoming and I always see them playing with the kids. My son is 4 years old and absolutely loves the ladies that usually work nights, Natalie, and Alexis to be specific. My son makes me go to the gym so he can see them, which is a good motivating factor to work out for me. They are so responsible and I know I can trust to leave my child in their hands.
This is a terrible place to buy a ring. I came here a few times over an year ago and customer service was completely different, 100% better. We bought a few rings here, anniversary bands, engagement ring, wedding band, among other things and we started having problems an year ago with their resizing work, it sucks, poorly executed it makes the ring look like it's going to break. 
Still, because they have always tried to help and resolve things we went back there to buy a Neil Lane ring, from Becky and Brian and this was the worst decision we made. They lied to us from the beginning saying this rings have to be specially made for each customer to their size, unless they have a ring and it's only one size difference (then they can resize it), they told us that there was no ring in any store that could be resized to my size so Id have to wait 3 months, ok we understood and agreed. We received a ring that was obviously resized, THREE MONTHS LATER, and the work was as bad as I had it on my rings before, I asked them and they told me it had been resized. Seriously?? 3 months for a ring that would take 2 weeks ?!? Of course we were upset not only because they lied but because the ring clearly looks different than a brand new made ring. They put in an order for a ring that would be actually manufactured this time and of course we had to wait ANOTHER 3 MONTHS....we were never contacted by the store by email or phone so we called them, they asked to return the call which they never did and when we called again, Laura told us they received the ring , THEY DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS MY RING, and they recalled on it because there was something wrong with it. She also told us we would have to wait, guess what, ANOTHER 3 MONTHS! How can they think this is acceptable ?! Why are they still on business with all this complaints?  I'm beyond frustrated and I'm for sure never buying anything else here, if they can't take good care of their customers than we will just go shop somewhere else!
The pizza's sauce has a nice taste.  However, pizza in this state is tough. Hard water and dough is just not a good match. The staff inside the pizza area I have found always friendly and with smiles on their faces.
Now, the restaurant side.  I've been 4 times, first time was when they first opened.  I will skip that tale.  Then I tried it again 6 months later.  A friend and myself were seated at the bar.  The bar had about four other people and this female bartender we had was awful.  She was busy chatting and helping the two men on our opposite corner.  We would've been better off serving ourselves.  We asked for every little thing, I mean everything- utensils, water a drink and yes. Even menus. She had no regard or knowledge of the menu, let alone manners. What she did have was an attitude.  My thoughts with any business is this: she was hired by them, hence that speaks volumes of the establishment.  It is a reflection on the business.  I was in Downtown Summerlin last night with the same friend and we dined elsewhere.  As we walked by as I snapped the picture we recalled that lack of a personality bartender. Never again.
The location is great. The staff present as competent.  The issue is the office presents to care more about payment arrangements even if they botched what you went there to fix. I felt like i was at a car dealership. In addition the arrangements that were set up were botched by them all the way past the last payment.  I do not recommended this dentistry. Inept accounting self serving charities and less than optimum treatment overshadow some good staff. Since dental care is expensive I would rather pay for care and not glitz wrapped in kindness.
I'm not an outdoorsy type by any stretch of the imagination (and my imagination is particularly stretchy) so it's rare for me to find myself in a place like this, but I followed my friend in as she hunted for a new waterproof for her climbing exploits.

At first we were a bit disappointed by the apparently small shop and there wasn't much besides coats at all (although not, that we could see, the kind she sought). Then we realised there was another floor, and when we ascended the stairs - oh my! An emporium of gargantuan proportions stocking just about everything I could think would ever be useful.

We made a beeline for the rest of the coats and were fairly promptly approached by one of the staff, who asked if she could help us. My friend, who had a very specific idea of what she wanted, tried to explain what she was looking for, but didn't seem to be able to communicate the idea too clearly. I being a not-expert in terminology was unable to assist! The girl was very helpful, though, and really knew her stuff. I stood by and let them exchange terminology and brand names for a bit.

Trying to figure out what the item being described was, she mentioned two things that we had missed downstairs, but said that one was definitely too large for my friend and the only one in stock, while the others were more expensive than my friend's budget allowed.

When we went back downstairs and browsed again, she was absolutely right - the two items we'd missed on our first scout around were almost perfect except one being the wrong size and the other being a bit pricey! So we didn't find what we'd gone in for, but there was a wide selection of brands and items available (beyond the oh-so-trendy The North Face) and the assistant was very knowledgeable, trying very hard to help.
Well I have been going to this particular location for a while, it was fantastic when it came about. It is in a fantastic location for a couple of reason 1. It is a great place to grab a quick lunch that isn't flash heated and during work, 2. For the same reasons, it is a great place to stop afterwork for some nice soup or sandwiches. Their coffee is pretty good as well add their lemonade. You really can't go wrong with Panera and finally the Fitchburg Location is a great addition to the arsenal.
When you're dealing with a party of 20 or so, finding the time to tweet them a photo of the beautifully-set Christmas tables all ready and waiting, WELL before they arrive, is probably a sign that you have got things well under control. And when you manage to bring out all of the dishes for each course in fairly impressive synchrony, well, that's confirmation.

L'Escargot Blanc is fine dining, but it doesn't feel like it. It's not intimidating; trundling up the stairs past French posters to be received at the top by someone taking coats, it feels more like visiting a friend's rather nice West End flat. It's not particularly spacious or impressive; it's sweet, and it's warm, and it's welcoming. That said, we weren't cramped; it isn't little - just cosy.

We were all served an aperitif aux truffes - a mushroom aperitif? Really? But it did smell fabulous and those who consumed it all seemed to agree that it was excellent. For a starter, I had butternut squash and chestnut soup - absolutely delicious. It was still piping hot and the chestnuts provided a gorgeous addition to both texture and flavour. I would have liked to see more bread - there was a basket for everyone before the starters came out, with a small pat of butter served on a wooden spoon (adorable!) but we were greedy birds and had consumed most of it before the course arrived - but on reflection, given what was to come, I'm glad there wasn't!

Next up was turkey, with more chestnuts. Hey, don't judge me; I've never had chestnuts before and I was excited. Plus, if you can't have turkey at a Christmas dinner, when can you, eh? Actually, venison with beef cheek in front of me to begin with. However, the head waiter instantly noticed my puzzled expression and scooted over from the other end of the room as though on a hoverboard (come on, science, get your act together, you've got less than two years now), crying "Ah, but you're not having that! You're having turkey, no?" How he remembered this is utterly beyond me but I was super-impressed.

Ah, turkey, that contrary bird, sticking its tail feathers up at ease of preparation, insistent on being dry and tasteless... well, not at L'Escargot Blanc. It was as delicate and flavoursome as the best chicken, but obviously turkey-tasting. The potato puree on which it was served was a spuddy dream come true - creamy and lush, with for perhaps the first time ever, enough salt for me; it actually almost stole the show!

The final delight of the evening was the iced vacherin. In the spirit of Yelpy adventurousness, I ordered it for the exact reason that I had no idea what it was. It turns out that it's basically Eton Tidy. It's what Eton Mess looks like before you beat it with a mallet, and with added ice cream and crushed hazelnuts. This is, in short, an epic win.

I'm definitely putting L'Escargot Blanc on my list of "places to take people I want to impress". In fact, I'm starting that list especially for this review.
Definitely an interesting concept! Being from Arizona and a constant Vegas visitor, I wanted something out of the strip that was more consistent. This place was just that! Very fun and delicious. We got the the Las Vegas package and it was more than enough for two people. Had to take about half of it home!

Don't pass this place up. 

TIP: Arrive early or come with time to spare because this place gets early!
Great Ambience, Decent Service, Overpriced Fake Italian Food.
This was our umpteenth visit to the "Queen" but brought first timer friends. It is Queens Table Week and therefore the service, while efficient, was hurried. We all felt a bit pushed. 

Being a big fan of the Crawfish Etouffee my choice was easily made. We each ordered a different entree and seemed pleased with our choices. Did I mention the service was swift? We could have finished our meal in an hour flat. Our server assumed, correctly, that we were ordering from the special menu and removed the regular menu because "you won't be needing these". If you want return Customers you may want to allow sufficient time to peruse the regular menu to see what other choices are available. 

Food was good, as always, but wouldn't recommend visiting during this promo week. My usual rating is 4 's but not this visit. 
Sorry got to run.............
Didn't expect much here upon arrival to the strip mall it is located in but was pleasantly surprised.   Decided to go for Italian food rather than go to the trendy Tarbell's  located in the same strip mall. As opposed to other reviewers,  I simple just parked in the half empty lot in front of the place, no problems.  Valet was available but not required. 
The place was empty but the reception was friendly and the service was good to excellent.  Friendly Italian waiter told me it was the slowest week of the year traditionally here.  
The wine list was more than adequate but the Italian selections were pricey, I found some better deals on the US selections.  
The food was also good to excellent with excellent pastas and fish available, I had the cioppino (I know cioppino and this was 4 star).
Salad and vegetable sides were done very well.
It is a little old school, kind of reminded me of a suburban Italian Durant's.
This review is an update from my previous review, however before I write my updated review I want to give major kudos to the General Manager Marc Habbouche. Upon seeing that my first dining experience at the restaurant was not pleasant he reached out to me right away to resolve the matter. That says a lot about this establishment and shows me that not only does Burtons Grill & Bar value feedback from their customers but they take their reputation as a fine dining establishment seriously.. So now I'm going into my updated review. Upon me and my guest arriving to the restaurant the hostess greeted us with a smile and promptly seated us at a booth. Not long after our server Josh came out and went over the menu with us. The one thing that rocks about Burtons is that they have something on the menu to appease everyone and if you have a food allergy they will accommodate your specific dietary needs. As an appetizer I settled on the Fried Green Tomatoes that came with a side of homemade pimento cheese. The appetizer was freshly made and simply amazing not to mention that the pimento cheese is made fresh in the kitchen and has the right out of spicy kick to it that was perfect. I also ordered a drink called the Spicy Paloma and my guest had a Spiked Summer Slush both of our cocktails were awesome. As for my main entree I ordered the Thai Bowl and it rocked it was the perfect combination and sweet and spicy I eat vegetarian so I really love how their has a dedicated vegetarian section on the menu. Lastly to top it I had a dessert that knocked my socks of it was a combination of three delicious cakes\/ pudding dessert, one was chocolate with by the way is Gluten Free another was a creamy cheese cake desert with blueberries and another was a caramel flavored dessert. Overall my dining experience was a complete 180 compared to the last time I dined with Burtons , not only was the ambiance and food top notch but the staff is very friendly and accommodating also the General Manager Marc Habbouche come out to greet me at my table personally he made me feel right at home, I was also greeted by the Assistant Manager Taylor and when you go to this place make sure to request Josh as your server he's awesome! Josh had a pleasant demeanor and really personalized my dining experience and checked back on me and my guest frequently and made sure that we were very well taken care of! If you are looking for great food with a beautiful ambiance with a personalized dining experience please be sure to check out Burtons! I'll surely be back! Thank you for making my dining experience a memorable one!!!
The only time I will ever return here is to buy simple accessories I am knowledgeable on and can put on my bike myself. Or to get the hot pink I'm with Awesome socks I love. 

That's about the extent of it.

I've been here on two occasions. The first was to start my bike search. When I informed a store employee of what I was going to use my bike for and ask what bikes may suit my needs, I was only shown one row of bikes that were pretty much all the same and all by the SAME manufacturer. I was told that was all they could offer me out of the tons of other bikes they had in their store.

The second time I biked there with a friend on my new bike, Lady Eleanor herself as a friend had some questions about her bike. They were fairly good at answering her questions. However, I was appalled when they stopped me dead in my tracks and asked me what was wrong with my bike. I panicked for only a short while til I realized they were going overboard on the fact that my pedals are not where most pedals are since my bike doesn't have much of a frame in the center. The employee kept going on about how it must be awkward to pedal (which it's not) and then called other employees over to gawk and make odd comments about my bike. 

Funny enough on the way out a woman drooled over my gorgeous bike with its interesting design and asked where I got it. I politely told her where.. and it wasn't at Landis.
We heard about Jim through Stilwell Pianos (see http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/stilwell-pianos-tempe) and he moved our piano from Mesa to Phoenix last October. I was so impressed with his punctuality, professionalism and friendly personality. He picked up the piano from a residence in Mesa, brought it to Phoenix and placed it carefully in our home ensuring it was exactly where I wanted it to be. His pricing was very reasonable and I believe a piano is something that should be moved by a specialist -- spend the extra money and hire someone who knows about pianos! Thanks, Jim!
I know I know. The rule of thumb is that cool people have dogs. Well, I'm pretty cool. But I am also just a me. And I also have a job. And I also volunteer. Which means I also don't have the time a dog deserves. So instead I have cat dogs. They may look like cats, but please don't let that fool you. I have dogs that use a litter box and that can jump fences. And that fetch. And that always want to play. 

I also have cats that can find nearly nothing of interest in wag n' wash. Even though they mention having cat supplies. And even though there's a cat in the store. And even though my cats wag their tails.  Probably great for dogs. But not cats.
Great Italian! The chicken Marsala came with choice of pasta\/veggie\/potato, soup\/salad, and bread. I went with the pasta (penne w\/marinara- very good!) and salad. Definitely get the dipping sauce for the bread! Lots of dessert options- we chose the cheesecake and had raspberry sauce added. Delicious!
I've only been here for dimsum! And most dishes are pretty average, but if you come then make sure to get the Black Bean sauce with Beef Rice Noodle dish. Super good!
Please do not buy an Insignia tv like I did. Crapper didn't even last 1 year before it stopped turning on. Oh, do not come here with your phone problems either, you will wait an hour easily waiting just to speak to someone. Learn from me :...(    To be fair their selection is great, but if you want quality you must spend more.
Quaint, whole-wheater eatery in a stripmall. Dining area was small and filled with second hand furniture, so, not a place to go for a romantic night out. Think more utilitarian.

Food was fresh and healthy. Tons of sides to choose from. Would be a great place to pick up lunch to go.
Rarely do I find a place where the food is really great but the rest of my experience is just so-so; usually, it's the other way around. But today at Alo Cafe I had very good food but the strangest experience.

Slow drip coffee was a wonderful start to brunch and it's nice they offer free refills - although I only got one and would've liked more. I'll get to the service a little later in the review. Ordered two of their most popular dishes: the french toast with hot fruit compote and the monte cristo waffle. Both were excellent! Also ordered a side of bacon but only got two pieces with my meal after being informed by our waitress that the cook dropped the other piece. Hmm...ok?! I waited, and waited, and after finishing the rest of meal finally got a new plate of bacon.

Which brings me to the rest of the experience. Alo Cafe is a super cute spot tucked away on a side street near Old Town Scottsdale. The exterior is quaint and reminds me of a cafe in San Diego. Unfortunately, the interior wasn't so clean and the floors were filthy. The bathroom was equally disgusting. I noticed the hand soap was watery, almost like it had been refilled with water to make it last longer -- yuck! I'll give them a pass on the overflowing restroom trashcan because I'm sure they had a busy Sunday brunch. But after a deep cleaning and with a few little touches of some cute decor, it would be soooo much better! 

While we were eating, one of the chefs came out of the kitchen, walked out through the dining area and carried the most dirty, disgusting trash can out to be emptied in the parking lot. I understand a trash can is for trash -- but man, the exterior of it looked like it had never been wiped down. To walk through the dining area with it is not a good look...at all. It was unappetizing and made me think the rest of the kitchen must be filthy. I am glad I visited the restroom after eating. The floors and the rest of the interior of this cafe really really need a deep cleaning.

In terms of service, we lucked out with the ONLY waitress that was actually doing her job. But because of that, she was a little overworked. One of the other waitresses seemed to have major communication issues and some form of social anxiety. She kept delivering incorrect dishes and bills to tables. I witnessed customers having a very challenging dining experience with her. When I walked in to use the restroom, I noticed she was ducked down at the checkout counter texting on her phone. This job didn't seem like a great match for her personality. The third waitress actually seemed to be doing a descent job until I saw her walk to her car and never return -- and she still had open tables! WOW!

So... after all that is said and done, I was wavering between two and three stars. The food and exterior ambience really were great! And our waitress did a descent job for our table. So I decided to be generous and go with three stars. I truly hope they do a deep cleaning of the place and hire some better wait and kitchen staff that can serve customers because the food itself was awesome!
Excellent restaurant.  We went with a big group.  There were 15 of us.  Everything we had was delicious. The Phaldhari Chaat appetizer was incredibly flavorful.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was the best I've ever had. The Gobi Matar Paneer Keema, a vegetarian dish with cauliflower and cheese, was so good and the Tamarind Lamb Curry, the chef's specialty, was tender and perfectly prepared.  Desserts are incredible, too.  If you like Indian food, you'll love Tamarind.  Even if you think you don't like Indian food, try Tamarind!
In the all Asian strip malls at the corner of Spring Mountain and Valley View is Pho Little Saigon. It is pretty large, pretty clean, and has a large menu of popular Vietnamese dishes.  This includes Khai Vi appetizers like Bi Cuon and Banh Xeo; Rice Porridge (Chao); 20 different Pho soups; about the same number of Com Dia rice plates and Bun Vermicelli dishes, Banh Canh (Vietnamese Udon); Bo Bai Mon (7 course beef) for $22.99, and Hu Tieu. Also Vietnamese desserts and drinks. 

I tried the Hu Tieu My Tho and it was excellent. You can order this wet as a soup or dry as more like a stew, with the more chewy clear sukiyaki type noodles. I ordered it dry, which comes with a side bowl of soup broth to pour over the ingredients after mixing. 

The Hu Tiel My Tho was chock full of ingredients: several large shrimp, a couple of fish cake balls, Chinese style sliced pork, Vietnamese style sliced pork, a couple of boiled Quail eggs, lots of green onions, chives, green leaf lettuce, yellow onions, and ground pork in a pork paste sauce. Delicious and only $6.59.

This place has 3 strobe lights blinking outside to help you find it. Inside, they have the obligatory plasma screens (4 in total!) showing Vietnamese variety show DVDs. They are open from 8:00am to
11:00pm 7 days a week! They say Cash Only, but they accepted my credit card when I asked them. 

If you are stuck on the strip and don't want to spend another $50 on overpriced Casino food, go west half a mile on Spring Mountain.
I found this dentist about 2 yrs ago. He is a great dentist - a nice guy - and good conversation between numbing and drilling (lol).
I don't go to Ramen Bar very often because my very own, what I thought was original, (delicious!) miso broth recipe tastes identical to their miso broth, but it's a great spot for a comforting bowl of soup. The ramen is not vegan, but they have rice noodles they can substitute. And they have and use TONS of veggies, which is how they sometimes win over my home version. A little pricy, but they don't skimp on ingredients.
We are here once for dinner and then the next day for breakfast since we did a mini stay-cation at the Hilton with 18 holes at the lookout golf club.

Dinner: 3 stars
We were seated for about 10 minutes before a bus-girl came to give us water and asked if we wanted bread.  We placed our drink and food order together- he got a draft  xx lager and the burger w fries.  I ordered the short ribs but they were sold out at the time (8:15).  I got the market salad instead since the menu was so limited.  Our server Colleen offered to have them add a salmon filet which I did.  I also had a glass of lost angel wine, I think a cab or Pinot?  The wine was good but I would have gotten a white wine with the buttery flavor of the salmon in retrospect.  My hunny got his burger medium well instead of medium though The patty did not seem hand pressed, so NOT amazing.  My salmon salad was good, generous with spinach, baby green beans, fontina, tomatoes, and the salmon atop was cooked nicely and had a crispy outer which was yummy!  We had the carrot cake which was ok- wish the sides had frosting!  The flavor was not too sweet and definitely homemade.  My hunny did not like the crunchy bits on top though I was fine with it.

Breakfast: 5 stars
We were seated one booth over from the night before.  We were greeted quickly by a super nice gal and she explained the buffet to us. My got the breakfast burrito and I did the buffet.  I got a plate of pineapple, honeydew, strawberries, made a Greek yogurt parfait with almonds and walnuts, and grabbed a muffin and croissant.  The pastries were delicious! His burrito was huge and presented really nicely with yummy garlic potatoes, 2 salsas, a grilled tomato and a baby asparagus.  

It seems as if they may have been understaffed for dinner though breakfast was better.

Overall I rate the restaurant at 4 stars based on our 2 experiences.
Knew right away I was at the right place.  Friendly, knowledgeable - no "business model" marketing.  Concern for my puppy's health and welfare was their top priority.  Love Dr. Gulbas.
*Bumping up a Star*

Why:
-The service is personable
- Dishes are consistent 
- Easy to call in for take away
- Very clean restaurant 
- Plenty of parking 

Mykonos delivers what your looking for in Greek food! If your wondering, go try it out
Intimate theatre with extra cushion covers on the seats :) About to see a show called "Jagged Little Pill" that uses Allanis Morissette music, we'll see how it goes!
The food was spot on. Nice thick cut steak - baseball sirloin with a twice baked potato. The seasoning on the steak was just right. 

The service here is lacking. It took about 5min to be even acknowledged. After my order was placed, not one word was said to me until I asked for my check. I guess I'm a service snob but this is what keeps customers away.
Dennis is seriously a life saver. I knew that I desperately needed to do something since my dog was overly aggressive to people and other dogs, but I was worried about her being too old and stuck in her ways to change. Dennis proved me wrong in the first 10 minutes of meeting him. I had never seen my dog be so attentive before. After just 3 sessions, my dog has made insane amounts of progress. Typically, my dog cannot be around other people or dogs as she acts very aggressive. Her bark is so loud and alarming that people typically RUN the other direction when they hear her. We were having to plan walks around when we wouldn't run into anyone. I just got back from a walk with her now and my mind is blown. The leash was slack the entire time, she sat whenever I stopped walking, and she even politely greeted another dog\/dog owner on the way! I cannot thank Dennis enough for all of his expertise and efforts. I went from hopeless to hopeful in such a short amount of time. I can't wait to see what else he can teach my dog in the future!
Not a self serve which translates into "we wait on you" which translated into small portion of yogurt and topping. This physically small establishment would be challenged to place a bank of yogurt dispensers but that seems to be the new reality. Staff was friendly, despite the portion control and were more than accommodating when asked for a bit more chocolate sauce'
I've been meaning to try Pizza Rock. I learned that they opened another branch in Green Valley Ranch but I figured I must go and try the original location first. 

We went here on a weekend and the place was pretty packed. The host was attentive and seated us right away. I would describe this place as a bar kind of place rather than a restaurant. The music was loud. Trying to have a conversation it was a little bit of a challenge. 

We ordered the White Wine Clams for appetizers. It was so good! The garlicky sauce was perfect for dipping with their complimentary bread. We opted to get the classic Margherita Pizza. This too was excellent. The crust was perfectly charred which added to the great flavor of the pizza. 

I think this is one of the best go-to places in Downtown. It is worth the drive just to go try this place.
I moved to the area about a year ago and this is definitely my go to place for good pizza. Being a transplanted NYer now living in the desert, it's hard to find good pizza. It makes me mad when I see all these lousy places advertising "NY style pizza" when it's a bunch of lies. I love Stevie's pizza! They're about as close to NY style pizza I can get outside of New York! ANDDDD they have garlic knots! Yum to the max! I also love the decor in the restaurant- lots of canvas prints of NY. Very cool. Thumbs up from me!
Good food! Nice variety of southwest comfort food. Live music is a nice touch, you can have a conversation without talking loud.
We could not go to the West Coast without trying In-N-Out Burger. We got the Double Double, Fries (Animal Style), and not featured the Cheeseburger Protein Style (which replaced the buns with lettuce). Overall the burgers were typical American style and we were underwhelmed by the fries. Our friend advised us to ask for it to be overcooked for it to be crispy. The Animal Style was tasty with melted cheddar, grilled onions, and their special sauce with pickles. Worth a visit since a Double Double Combo is $6.85 USD and a Cheeseburger $2.50 USD.
We called Goettl 3 days ago and they have NOT gotten back to us!  Our heater broke, I called Sahara Air yesterday and they were at my house by the afternoon!

Where is this 1 hour response time?
The Fresh Market is a specialty grocery store. The shopping experience is completely different from those of Trader Joe's, Publix or Harris Teeter. From the minute you walk in you notice that something is different. The lighting isn't so harsh and they have classical music playing lightly. You pay a premium but you can find some great deals. They have an expansive organic and specialty food selection. The customer service is fantastic and I always look forward to my shopping experience.
Thanks to global warming, we have been having 70+ degree days regularly... I was in need of a pedi and happened to be in Plaza Midwood. Nikki W. gave me two recommendations in the hood and Malibu was closest! Wow! What a fantastic experience! I was greeted when I walked in and asked what service I needed. I just wanted a basic pedi ($25). Khai took great care of me! She was very through and very detail oriented. The interior is simple but clean. My toes look great and I didn't break the bank! I'll be back for sure!
After spending hours at the Charleston outlets, we decided to head to The Forum Shops to finish buying some gifts for friends and decided to dine at Trevi.  Having walked by this restaurant countless times over the years, we finally decided to try.  I was starving as it was close to 2 pm and only had coffee and a danish for breakfast.  Not sure why I chose the chicken burger special but according to the waiter it was awesome.  It arrived and looked ok ... knew it would be ground chicken meat (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/aQab9yLDDP_R9ZgRDt7MfA?select=G0sFpyrVp_EIrj4KdG8CHg).  Took a few bites and realized that this dish was going to be tossed away.  The ground chicken was mixed with tons of rosemary which is all I could taste.  The burger was topped with bbq sauce and bacon strips but all I could taste was the rosemeary.  After only eating half of the burger, I called it quits.  Again not sure why I decided to go with the chicken burger and should've just ordered a pizza.
After having my second baby and attempting to hit the gym and get back in shape, my body just didn't seem to be on the same page. I had aches and pains like never before and decided to seek out a chiropractor in hopes for some advise. Dr. P and Dr. Tory took such good care of me, explained how the structure of my body had changed through the pregnancy and birthing process and needed some adjustments to get back on track. They gave me a treatment plan, with a goal to be finished in three months. Here I am after the three months and I am able to work out, run, and cycle like I am 20 again! 

Everyone that works at this office is so genuine and knowledgable. I have really built a relationship with them, rather than just feeling like another nameless face needing to be adjusted. Don't believe the negative stigma associated with chiropractors. They really help so much, especially AFC!
Mmmm - they have a great vegetarian sandwich that I just can't resist!  The bf and I went for lunch on a Sunday and were happily surprised to find that they weren't busy.   The guy taking lunch orders was super friendly, and didn't mind that I'm a picky vegetarian - a big plus in itself!  Always had a positive experience here!
Had a blast here playing the horse race game  . There was a malfunction which one of the cashier girls fixed immediately. Then we had another malfunction and a manager by the name of Richard P. argued with us that it was not a malfunction and we did not push the button to bet correctly. He was extremely rude and obnoxious. It was really embarassing because he started yelling and getting really upset and everyone was looking. We told him to look at the logs because there were prior malfunctions because he said he did not believe us. Mind you this game is only a quarter to play and we won a dollar which was due to us and the game did not pay it out. Richard refused to pay it out which is fine since it's only a dollar. It's just really sad that a service manager would treat customer this way. This was a really cool place and had so much fun with my friends here until Richard P pretty much ruined the vibe. Unfortunately, we will not be coming back here because of the way we were treated. He treated us like dogs and did not once apologize. This was on Saturday 9\/20 at approximately 4.30 pm in case anyone from Corporate cares.
I have been here on several occassions. Great casual place for brunch, big group (they have private dining), or a small gathering. They have great specials like $1 corkage fee and $10 pizzas on Mondays. Friendly staff and food usually comes out pretty quickly. My recommendations are tacos and beef cheek poutine for appetizers. For mains, there are a lot of good choices like salad, burgers, pizza, mac and cheese, and ribs. Also, they have a great brunch menu. I suggest making reservations as they can get quite busy on some nights.
We love Flancers!!!  I love their filet salad with gorgonzola dressing (yum!) and husband loves their Philly Cheesesteak with fries.  He says it's the best he's had.  Pizza is o.k. but greasy.  Service has always been great.
The Bellagio is a wonderful and pretty resort hotel on the Las Vegas Strip!!!!! The dancing water show is awesome, along with the glass ceiling inside, and so much more!!!!!!!!!!!
During my buddy's bachelor party, we decided to dine here for one night since we were staying at the Venetian.  We had originally made reservations for a party of 8 but later realized we didn't count a few people.  Luckily, Cut was able to accomodate us but instead of being in the dining room we were now seated out near the bar.  Service was as good as the BH location and the delicious parmesan bread sticks didn't disappoint.  After ordering a few bottles of wine for the group, the appetizers began coming out.  We ordered the bone marrow flan which didn't seem as flavorful as I remembered it being.  The beef carpaccio didn't disappoint!

Ordered the prime rib eye http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/cut-las-vegas?select=in0KN-y0agu9Gr8UOrwMzw#qwXO8aGWOqPqCo1jU93GWg along with a few sides for a few of us to share .... creamed spinach w\/ organic egg, mac n cheese, and the sauteed mushrooms http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/cut-las-vegas?select=in0KN-y0agu9Gr8UOrwMzw#hG1z92uuzB-O4bI1KQUGUA.  As with the location in BH, Cut has a tendancy to overcook their steaks so since I like my steaks rare, I order it black and blue.  Mentioned this to the other people in our group and a few listened and a few didn't.
Westmoreland pool service has it figured out. Great service by exceptional employees. Everyone that we have met has been a pleasure to have at our home working. All are very professional, knowledgeable, and well mannered. We do recommend Westmoreland pool service to anyone that is looking for pool service or repair.
My wife and I are Vegas locals and love trying new restaurants in the city. This was our first tour with Lip Smacking Foodie Tours and we plan on doing another one! We did the Afternoon Culinary tour and Ray was our guide. Ray was awesome, super friendly, knowledgeable, and made sure to keep our group engaged, but also let us savor the venues and dishes. What I love about this tour is not only do you get to sample amazing establishments in Las Vegas, but the food is amazing with plentiful portions. Seriously, come hungry because there enough food to go around and fill your appetite.
I slowly opened one eye, and then the other, I checked all major body parts...everything was still there and moving. I lifted my head off the pillow, that's when I realised I had a very dry mouth and a gentle pounding in my head, it was time to get to the kitchen...must...drink....tea.

So now you know how the evening ended, it's time to go back to the start. 
My dining partner in crime (DPIC) and I had decided on Angels with Bagpipes as the venue for a celebratory meal. We arrived to be shown promptly to our table by the friendly staff who immediately made us feel welcome and offered any help with questions while we perused the menu. 

We were seated in the back area which reminded me of a friends living room that has impeccable taste in interior décor. It was relaxed yet with the perfect balance of formal and informal that makes you feel like you're somewhere special but not that you can't relax and enjoy yourself.

It didn't take long for us to make our dining decisions, we chose the Chateau Ka wine from Lebanon after a recommendation from my DPIC and we were not disappointed at all. I went for the Orkney Scallops with lentils, apple, caramel and crackling as I was intrigued by the combination of flavours for a starter and being a fan of a classic steak chose that for mains.

The scallops were tender and fresh, and the lentils added a wonderful texture perfectly balancing the sweetness of the apple and caramel, the crackling added a lovely 'bite' and it was beautifully presented. The steak was perfectly done to order, however the pesto tomato was a little over loaded with pesto but a small complaint given when you order steak it's the meat that's the star.

My DPIC ordered the beef tartare, and after stealing a fork full I can confirm it tasted wonderful with a wonderful crisp fresh crunch from the onions. For her main she ordered the lamb which was again perfectly cooked but she felt there was a little too much 'going on' with the sweetbread, anchovy and almond garnish. We're both of the opinion when it comes to a meat dish, less is more but this is personal opinion after all.

We decided to finish off the evening with a shared cheese board and some port, the staff again demonstrated their knowledge by walking us through the cheeses on the board and informing us they were displayed from mild to strong across the board. We ordered the Fonseca 97 Port as my DPIC informed me she still dreamt about the port from when she'd been in 2010. And it was everything it was built up to be, so we had a second glass just to be able to savour it a little longer. 

The cheese was a good mix of hard and soft, and whilst we're both cheese fiends we didn't find the strongest one over powering and we easily polished them all off as the portion sizes were just right.

Overall we had a lovely evening there, I'd recommend this venue for special occasions with friends, romantic dinners or if you have friends from out of town staying. Make sure your guests spot the Angel with Bagpipes statue which the restaurant is named after, her whistful expression makes me think she also might be thinking of the glass of port and cheese she's going to have at the end of her shift.

Oh, and in case you're wondering. I can highly recommend the Jolly Roger and Monteiths and the Albanach for post dinner drinks. Probably just don't do them all in one night, otherwise you'll end up how I started this review!
Best ice cream place in TDot! I love their Pistachio & Chocolate Lover's Chocolate. The Taste & Service are very consistent in the 5 summers that I've been here. Even with all the new ice cream place such as Bang Bang, Sweet Jesus, Kekkou, etc. this place will always be a classic! This is not the place for insta-pics, just a good honest gelato. You might see celebs during TIFF here.
I was REALLY excited to come to this one as it's the largest one they have because my local one doesn't have a ton of stuff for guys. 

First of all, this place is overwhelming. It seemed like we were in there 2 hours before we finally got to all of the sections that they have. But then there's the guys section, there wasn't much of a selection at all, and they didn't even have a sale section! 

My wife seemed like she had a great time in here but as someone who likes this brand, it didn't really excited me. But I will still shop there.
This has to be the most disappointing visit. I remember this place having the best lechon and lechon sauce. Well today that wasn't the case, the lechon was dry, oily and skin was not crunchy. It was so sad, we recieved our free Ngo-yong egg roll and it came glossed with oil and cold inside. 

Ordered crispy calamari, was not crispy at all and batter fell off every piece. The calamari wasn't even cleaned properly you can see the skin and guts. The order of crispy Kang Kong was as disppointing as the calamari, the supposedly tempura batter was hard and filled with oil. You can literally squeeze oil out. They served this with their garlic mayo which just tasted like old mayo. Had the oxtail bulalo, which you would think would be oxtail right? Well there was oxtail but they mixed another cut of beef, so upsetting. To top it off we had 3 of each chicken and pork bbq, they were served med rare. They weren't cooked all the way through. 

I liked this place and wish it was back to what it was before. They seem like they're just cutting corners and it's just completely disheartening to know that restaurants especially filipino restaurants will serve this food without thought of standard. 

I guarantee you that Filipinos are proud of their food and these restaurants give the cuisine a bad name.
* I'm looking forward to their rice bowl since it's remind me of the one I had at the Chairman in San Francisco 
*the menu of their site is slightly different with more variety of the rice balls, but the food truck seem to only serve 2 types so I wonder when they will bring the others onto the truck?

-Rice Balls (Taiwan and Osaka rice balls)
The Osaka rice ball consisted of Japanese beef curry, roasted edamame, diced carrot and curry potato, then topped with fried ramen noodles. The Taiwan rice ball consisted of Taiwanese sausages, hoisin garlic minced pork and diced potatoes. Both rice balls were crunchy on the outside, soft and gooey (stuffed with mozzarella cheese) on the inside. They didn't feel oily nor fatty either! In terms of flavors, I preferred the Osaka rice ball as you can taste the distinctive Japanese curry flavor in it. The Taiwan rice ball was good but I couldn't really taste the sausage, maybe more in the filling might have been better?

-Satay Chicken Roti Taco (roasted satay chicken, pickled carrots & red onions, sweet chili slaw, crispy onions and Sriracha mayo)
Another delicious dish! The chicken was moist and had lots of spices. The slaw with the carrot didn't have much flavor. With that said, they really helped to ease the heat from the chicken and sriracha mayo sauce! I love that instead of the traditional taco shell, they serve this on a roti because it held the ingredients so much better.
Vendredi soir 8h et il y a une heure d'attente. Par chance, L'gros luxe est devant la jolie Place Roy et à côté d'une épicerie. On peut donc bien attendre dans ce parc sans problème, car nous donnons notre nom à un employé du resto et il nous appelle quand la table est prête :) 

Donc, après une heure qui a passé bien vite, nous sommes assise et commandons à boire et à manger. Je ne suis pas très cocktail, donc je me suis pris une bière L'Gros Luxe. 26oz. C'est gros, c'est de la Pabst, mais c'est 6$ .On se commande les fameuses frites d'avocats. C'EST BON, C'EST GRAS, ON AIME ÇA. Puis les tacos de poissons et Porc effilochés arrivent. Wow des gros tacos! 2 dans l'assiettes pour 6$. Et pour être santé la salade de betterave et fromage de chèvre sur roquette, YUMMY, toujours un plat à 6$ et pas un petit bol, une grosse salade!. 

Bref, ça vaut la peine pour le prix! Je constate dans le menu que les végétariens vont être comblé, car il y a quand même du choix! Les drinks ne sont pas super cher non plus. 

Bref, j'y retourne bien sûre, par contre de ce que j'ai constaté, je ne crois pas que ça soit adapté à un gros groupe, vous allez être tassé. Mais sinon super, et la place est ben ben cute. Le service aussi super rapide. Personnel très aimable. 

Bonne visite!
Awesome little local shop filled with local goodies. This is my go to spot to pick up a gift or two, and maybe one for me. 

On a recent visit, I found out that they will be closing at the end of this month due to their lease ending. I hope they find a new location soon!
Exactly like the yelp 3 star saying says...this place is A-Okay! 

I had a craving for Italian and I had gotten home late and didn't want to spend a lot at a sit down, so we looked this place up and make the trek to check it out.

I actually love the place..it's a total hole in the wall, that has clearly been there for ages. It's a converted house, next to a garage. When you walk inside it looks a bit like a kitchen, with a bunch of tables. The walls are covered in airbrushed Italian scenes and there is a sort of bar to the side, where you place your order.

The menu is quite limited though and I was disappointed that there is not a single pasta dish. Instead this place seems to specialize in sandwiches. 

The gentleman who owns the place and makes the food was really the highlight of this place and would be the reason I would keep coming back. He is sweet and cheerful and kind and was quick to offer us samples to try. 

I ordered eggplant parmesan and my husband ordered a veal sandwich. Everything was fine, although nothing special. My husband ordered a caesar salad and the bacon bits were the sort of fake, packaged kind an the muchrooms for the sandwich were from a can. 

So yes, this food IS made with love, because this gentleman who runs the place is lovely and has a true pride in his food. And the prices are extremely low. But it's still not the best quality and the taste suffers from it.

THAT said, you are not going to find such a large, veal sandwich for as cheap.

For these reasons I sort of equate this place to an Italian Subway sandwich shop. That's not a bad thing! The quality is on par with a fast food sandwich place and the prices are low. You know you ALL eat at Subway from time to time, when you just need a quick sandwich. So if you're in the area, I would check it out!
Overall, the outlets have several nice stores to shop at - a great variety. There is not that many restaurant to grab a bite (I believe 3 inside the "market"), but I didn't mind because I was not eating here. 
Everything seemed to be clean and no debris; that I saw.
This is a great second choice if concord is a bit too far but I personally like concord better than this outlet mall.
It's subway. I'm not really sure what else to say. But it's near my office and when I forget lunch, and don't want anything the cafeteria has to offer and I'm on a limited time budget this place wins every time. 

Only downfall is that if you go directly at noon, you're gonna be in line for awhile, due to the office folk. Go a little early or a little late and you'll be good to go.
Normally I enjoy ordering from here, however this particular evening, it took an hour and a half to deliver, my food was cold, and parts of it burned, and they forgot my salads, which is where they put the little dish of tzatziki in, so I had to eat dry, burned chicken. 
On top of that, it took an hour for them to deliver the salads again. 
After paying $35.00 for 2 meals, and a good tip to the idiot delivery guy, not impressed.
And on top of all that, no one at the restaurant apologized, neither did the delivery guy. Really disappointing.
An experience of a sky view of T-Mobile arena.  A pleasant area of 'seclusion' away from the bustle of the below levels of the Arena.  
The Hyde Lounge is a wraparound from above of the arena.  It's criminal not to be above in this space and not have a few of the straightforward drinks.  I myself ordered the quite simple- compari and soda.  My concert goer partner ordered a dirty martini. Of course I gave it a taste test swirl- it was a killer martini. 
Reserve a sofa area, or perhaps a high top table area and order a flavorful appetizer or two and mix that with some cocktails.  It's a cozy setting, sleek and contemporary.  Best of all, away from the crowd below.  We stayed up here during the opening band.  Next show, I may just spend the entire time here!
Wow - I have to admit I was impressed!  When a coworker suggested a bunch of us go here for lunch, I was a little weary.  A buffet?  Ewwww....

But no!  It was delicious!  The salad bar was fresh, staff were actively replenishing everything, it was clean, and there were a lot of great choices.  I greatly appreciated the vegetarian and low fat\/healthy labeling and options.  

I can't believe I'm going to admit this, but I'll definitely be back!!
Ok ya so I'm reviewing a freaking Taco Bell...

But I am impressed. They are the nicest folk here. Can be slow when it's a large crowd but the short lady (I am tall) and I have a running joke about our heights. 

End story: this ain't your typical don't give a crap tb. This is a great place!
This place is my favorite breakfast\/brunch place. Every Sunday my wife and I are here and we've tried everything on the menu. You can't go wrong. The drinks are great. Service is great and food is delicious. You won't be upset if you come!
I've been coming to Toby's for years and yeah the establishment isn't the nicest, especially the back area but I still love it.  The wings are in my top 5 of Toronto and an added bonus is that they come with fries.  People rant and rave about Duff's, St Louis but the wings at Toby's are better in my opinion.  They're a good size (not super steriod looking) and they're nice and saucy.  The servers are nice and they can take a joke.  
On cheap pitcher night there is nothing to complain about except for the occasional loud and obnoxious group which happens in most bars\/restaurants.  
The other food on the menu is pretty average.  I've had the nachos and a burger but the jewel of this place is the cheap wings and cheap booze.  If you're looking for a low key fun night then I'd highly recommend Toby's.
A modest, comfy tap room. Friendly service. None of the beers bowled me over but it was enjoyable. Love the doors re-purposed as table tops. They had complementary bags of potato chips to snack on. Five brews on tap plus a super small experimental batch that was chilling in the cooler. No complaints.
No breakfast all day, sadly!  They stop at noon, so chorizo also becomes unavailable.  The employees were very nice about it though, especially the goateed gentleman who seemed like the supervisor\/manager.

The lovely Mexican pastries that greet you are very affordable, though the flan is a touch expensive at $4\/$3 (depending on the type).

My fish quesadilla was somewhat small, about the size of a Taco Bell one.  It was beautifully crispy with good flavors and actual texture, but was also $7.50.  It came with a small scoop of guacamole on the side.  My large slice of cheesecake from the pastry case was 99 cents, and had a very light texture.  The yellow cake like top layer gave it a good chew, and it was very creamy too.  I ate the entire thing, and I feel it balanced out the slightly small quesadilla in terms of overall value.

Atmosphere is okay, with wood and brick.  I can see why people are comparing it to Chipotle.  I definitely appreciate that they're trying.  The restroom was very nice and clean!

There was a strange chemical or burning rubber smell in the air when they were grilling something though.  Very unpleasant.

It was interesting to note they had a pretty strong Caucasian clientele coming in while I ate, so hopefully they will stay part of the neighborhood.

One of the employees started cleaning the glass right behind me just now and the Windex smell is really awful.

I'm going to be slightly generous with my stars and boost them up to 4, since they're a solid 3.5 and I really appreciate a slightly more upscale (clean, new) "fast casual" restaurant choice in the neighborhood.  Their dessert choices (pastry, cut fruit, ice cream, popsicles) really help set them apart from the competition.
Definitely the best carwash in the Las Vegas area closely located to the strip.  Traveling from California needed a carwash bad.  Windy City wash did a excellent job in getting my car hand washed inside not outdoors highly recommend them. The owner is hands on in the carwash process.
The workers here are ridiculously nice.  They're perfectly happy to let you sample three, four, or five different gelato flavors!  They're very personable and conversational too.

I've ordered the peppermint (candy cane) flavor and the mint cookies and cream.  My first time here they even gave my mint gelato cup some of the delectable "garnish" cookies that were sprinkled on top of the gelato and made it look wonderful.  No special garnish the second time, sadly.

Go for a hand-packed pint for a more
cost-effective treat.

As always, free parking at the back of the Biltmore!
Came here with friends on our first full day in Toronto after journeying up from the Detroit metro area the night before. 



We tried the waffles and they were delicious - I really liked them because they were light, fluffy and didn't leave you with that we-ate-too-much-for-breakfast-and-now-are-comatose-for-the-rest-of-the-day feeling. 

Ambiance: nice feel - eclectic + diner-y + old school

Service: a little slow - we walked in and it definitely took us a few minutes to get anyone's attention, otherwise, our waiter was very friendly and helpful and my coffee was consistently refreshed

Prices: I think they are a little on the high end, we ended up with 3 orders of waffles of various kinds (2 with fruit, 1 with egg\/bacon) a coffee, juice x2 and we had a 50 dollar bill by the end, but we were very satisfied overall, and this was a great place to start the day off!
Consistently amazing service. The staff are so friendly and professional, and the environment is very serene. What I appreciate most is the hygiene practices that are in place. Since discovering Sugarmoon, I've never gone anywhere else!
Ok, so the first thing you need to know is that the light fittings in here are little ice creams. I ain't kidding. They're adorable.

I guess you probably also need to know about the ice cream. Well. It's stonkingly good. It's rich and creamy and at £3 a pot it's everything you'd hope. Price wise I would say that's decent for what you get.

I tried hot cross bun flavour - ZOWEEEE! That was pure hot cross bunnity goodness. You can pick two flavours for a standard pot, which I did, but alas I cannot recall what the second was. It was very nice though. I remember thinking "oh yes, this one is very nice too", but I was obviously preoccupied by the hot cross bun one.

Mary herself is a darling and makes everything in the shop herself. She's very lovely and clearly in love with her work, happy to recommend flavour mixes to the hesitant or overwhelmed. Glorious ice cream in a sweet and cute little parlour in the beautiful Grassmarket on a sunny day - what more could one wish? Thank you, Megan M, for this long-needed introduction!
Only ever eaten in the bar during happy hour, so this review is not for old school steak house fare with all the fixins. 

That's cool though because I can't bring myself to eat a ginormous hunk o' muscle very often anyway. I can go years without ending up in a steakhouse and when I do it's generally a meh experience regardless of how orgasmic people tell me the slice of cow is supposed to be. 

Saloon 1889 on the other hand is right up my alley. Hey, we all have our vices. 

The atmosphere is pure Arizona. It's the perfect combination between the slightly nauseating Rawhide's folksy old-Zona and the Rat Pack old school Arizona exemplified by Durant's, with maybe a dash of Monti's La Casa Mediocre tossed in for good measure. 

The bar is a massive antique-looking dark wood relic from another era, with ornate pillars and a huge gilded mirror along one side. The bartenders also look like they could whip you up a classic cocktail, the stuff with bitters, or a girly sugar bomb. They got skills. 

The happy hour is really where's it's at here. Free sliders, chips and salsa. Couple bucks off the bar bites, which are substantial meal replacements. Cheap wine, well, beer, all delivered with a smile.
I've been here several times now and have loved everything I've tried. The pulled pork sandwich, the tempura friend string beans, the hummus sampler, grilled chicken and goat salad, the burger, the sweet potato toters, the wine- it's all been good. 
The wait staff are very friendly and nice too. 
Can't go wrong by coming here!
This is the only salon I will go to in the valley for waxing. I found JFY about 2 years ago and have been a fan ever since. I always make sure to see Heather (although I'm sure all the girls are great.) She is a fantastic esthetician and I am always so impressed with her work. I've never had a brow wax like the ones I get from her! The braz you can get here is amazing as well, totally worth it. They explain everything really well and make sure that you are comfortable. They pride themselves on a "no double dipping" rule and that is something I appreciate. The customer service is fantastic. Loretta, the owner, is always quick to get me on the schedule as I am typically guilty of needing a last minute appointment. I would highly recommend JFY and plan to be a loyal customer for a long time!
Z Tejas exists for one reason and one reason alone, to sell awesome margaritas at not so awesome prices that you'll totally shell out for anyway because their massive strength will sucker punch you with the first sip and then bat you around like an orca playing with a baby seal right before going in for the kill.

Seriously.

Three of these things will have you giggling, slurring declarations of love to the members of your party, believing your sexiness status just gained +2, craving Jack in the Box tacos and possibly breaking a heel upon your exit.

They are a thing of beauty. (And the reason why they enforce a three margarita limit.)

Unfortunately, they'll run you 6 to 9 bucks depending on how much razzle dazzle you're going for. The Sixth Street Margarita is the most basic, frozen or on the rocks, and is delicious. So is the Z Top Shelf, and the Chambord, and the Frozen Watermelon, and the Grand Marnier, and I think you're sensing the trend here.

And the food... Well, it exists so you don't leave in the condition discussed above. It's not as good as the margaritas, but once you have a couple, you're really not going to care that much.

Brunch is the best time to hit this place up and indulge in a three dollar mimosa, their three dollar top shelf do-it-yourself bloody mary bar (with all the fixins, including beef jerky stir sticks!), or the epic margaritas. The chicken and potato hash is decent, but it used to be much better back when it was the savory sage chicken and potato hash and had, how do you say, actual flavor. Now it's just blah by comparison. Well done blah. But blah all the same (although Mr. Man loves it). So you may want to hit up the smothered burrito or jerk chicken salad instead, both of which are delicious. 

Happy hour is also a pretty good deal, with one dollar off all drinks and half price appetizers. I'd recommend the Cast Iron Skillet Dumplings that are like crispy round Asian pot stickers that come out sizzlin' in sweet chile sauce or the Tortilla Soup, which is done really, really well here with avocado and lots of chunky chicken. 

But forget the food. It's the backup vocals to the wailing showboat sex symbol of a lead singer that runs back stage for a mid show sex\/drug\/booze binge while his second tier stand-in entertains the crowd with a limp solo. 

The margaritas are bad ass and they know it. Let 'em get a little saucy with ya. 

Oh, and the patio rocks almost as hard as the margaritas, so make sure to be seated out there.
Firehouse just didn't do it for me... Stopped in for lunch at this Firehouse Subs after spending the morning getting to know Charlotte. The place was pretty busy, as it was during the peak lunch hour. I was in the mood for a salad, and since there was only one on the menu, my choice was made for me. I got to pick the protein though. I chose the tuna salad. The boyfriend got the hook & ladder combo (cute). We were both amused by the large selection of hot sauces that were available (we both LOVE spicy food & hot sauce). I was largely underwhelmed with the salad, which consisted of large leafs of lettuce, a few thick bell pepper slices and a large wedges of tomato. It was topped with three sizable scoops of tuna salad and provolone cheese slices. I just wasn't psyched on the salad at all. Yes, I know I'm at a sub shop ordering a salad, but it really isn't that hard to throw a decent salad together. The boyfriend said his sub was meh. I personally prefer Which Wich.
Great store. Pretty much the same as Home Depot. If you can't find it here, you can always head to Home Depot. Between the two places, they pretty much have everything you need to remodel your home. I do prefer Home Depot Behr paint over Lowes brand though.
Had dinner here this past Saturday night.  Was wowed from start to finish, was greeted right away and sat for our 8:00PM Reservation.  Had an extremely knowledgeable waitress named Rachel that made fantastic recommendations based on the true preparation of the dishes.  There was too much that we wanted to try on their far from ordinary menu, full of interesting dishes.  We went with the Beef tartar appetizer which was so fantastic, smooth, flavorful and the delicious egg topped it off perfectly.  We also tried the tuna taquitas which were great as well.  The Fried Pickles are a must have, the breading is incredible but they are huge.  For entrees we enjoyed the Moules Frites with White Wine Garlic Broth, which the girlfriend said where some of the best she ever had.  I enjoyed their signature duck dish, this was such fresh meat but what really made it for me was the pastrami edging.  The sauerkraut pierogoies were a nice side of the dish aswell.  Dont miss out on their drinks, this was the best Manhattan cocktail ive ever had!  Also enjoyed a drink called the Perfect Sour, that was a great addition similar to a Pisco Sour.  Will be returning soon with plenty of options to try !
I agree with all the other reviews. Wes, the owner, is a honest business person focused on customer satisfaction.  We are new to the Phoenix area and besides trying to find a doctor and a dentist, a car mechanic is a tough search.  Well we are searching no more. Wes will be maintaining both of my vehicles here on out.
We just took our big family there. I think we had 14 and the food is still great. The service took a little longer but hey we were a large group! Our whole family loves all their meals!
Half hits, half misses. (And we tried a LOT of stuff.)

Hits: 
-Soft shell crab roll. Beautiful presentation, wonderful flavor. The aioli was really nice, and the crab was fried to perfection. 
-Bacon wrapped medjool dates. YES. MORE OF THESE. ALWAYS.
-Wild mushroom tacos. So good you won't miss meat. I echo the concerns of others that they are too small for the price...but I'm willing to pay whatever you demand for more.
-Miso eggplant. Delicate and creamy. Will make a believer even out of the most ardent eggplant hater. Perfect.
-Green magic mojito. This blended drink danced on my taste buds, but if you don't like your drinks herbaceous, go for something else.

Neither here nor there: 
-Guacamole with dried fruit. Decent guac but too much lime, needed more salt and a bit of heat, tomato, or onion flavor. At 11 bucks, it should really come with a couple extra chips instead of making you shell out for more.
-Rollo Chingon. Too much guac on top, but the adobo shrimp sushi was tasty and the roll was stunning to look at. Just take some of that extra avocado topping and smear it on your lotus root chip. 
-Coconut cocktail. Serviceable, but needed something to put it over the top. Couldn't really taste the lemongrass or lime. 
-Valet. You gotta. Ain't no way around it.

Misses: 
-Crispy pork belly roll. So aggressively salty. Could taste hardly anything it was so salty. Should have listened to some of the other reviewers on here and avoided it. 
-Korean beef taco. Salt lick central. So salty you couldn't taste anything else. Really a bummer. Also not traditional Korean beef like you'd get a Korean BBQ, but shredded.
-Head on giant shrimp. Shrimp is singular in this case. And dramatically overcooked. Inconsistent seasoning, with one bite rubbery shrimp and the next almost pure salt rub. The pureed garlic and halved cherry tomatoes were pretty insipid too. Don't waste your 14 bucks on one nasty shrimp.  
-Nightclub atmosphere. So necessarily loud.
Ok final update on Dundas Spring Garden. I think they've earned their place back in my good books. 

This is still our go to for Chinese delivery. Always through Tasteaway (do a google search for promo codes! I always get at least 15% off!)

Go-to order is: Spring Rolls, Singapore Fried Vermicelli, Sichuan Crispy Shredded Beef, Steamed Rice, General Tso chicken. 

Still looking for another chicken dish, General Tso can be hit or miss, but the chicken balls are a definite MISS. Not sure how they fail here but the rest of the food is quite yummy and gives me my fix.
I was craving a burrito bowl after a workout so instead of going to my usual stop, which was Chipotle, I opted to try Braddah's.  I love Hawaiian food so why not.

At 7pm on a regular Monday night, this place was just deserted. I think it was the location. There is only one other restaurant there in that plaza which was a Japanese place and even they do not look like there were getting a lot of business too. 

We walked in and were greeted warmly by everyone in store. They asked if it was our first time there and we said "Yes." They gave us a sample of each of their meats and recommended which sauce goes well with what. So we got two things: Huli Huli Chicken bowl with brown rice and a Pulehu Steak Burrito with the seaweed rice. 

Flavor wise, I loved it! Only concern - The food was actually pretty cold even though they prepared it in front of us. Maybe the meat was left out for too long? Given that they do not get as much business, the meat was a tad bit cold so I was disappointed about that. This has a potential to be really good but it just did not have that served hot and fresh factor that should come in all sit down places anyway. Even Subway offers to heat up your food, right? I do have to remember, however, that it is a fast food place.

So overall, I'd say meh. I would still give it three stars because of how nice the staffs were.  They even gave us free coconut bark for desserts.
Le plus beau Provigo que j'ai vu de toute ma vie!!! AH CE QU'IL EST CHARMANT! Imaginez-vous arriver au stationnement avec une musique d'ambiance pour faire l'épicerie. Et on rentre...Non ce ne sont pas les tomates, les laitues en spécial qu'on voit en rentrant mais le comptoir à gâteau où il y a toujours des petits échantillons gratuit. Et ensuite un stand où ils font des jus frais, où bien-sûre nous pouvons y goûter aussi. Entre les gâteaux et les jus, il y a souvent, très souvent des chanteurs ou un petit band de musique de 2-3 personnes et jamais les même. Vive la diversité. Le comptoir à viande est fabuleux surtout pour les bbq l'été il y a du choix et du choix déjà mariné. Tout dans le magasin est bien placé. Le staff est amical. Bref, si tous les super marché était comme cela, j'y passerai la journée. C'est clairement une attraction à faire à St-Sauveur.
Red Rock Canyon has several hiking trails from easy to difficult. The scenery is amazing. Turtle Head Peak is a great work out if your looking to burn some calories. The annual pass is only $30.00 for one car load.
I'm a New Yorker through and through.  Of course I love diners, real 24 hour diners which have that older, shaggy feel:) and the menu has 'disco fries'.  Yes, I can order it that way, but seeing that on a menu makes it.
Black Bear Diner is a great diner for this side of the country:)  
Unfortunately, it's not Open 24 hours- COME ON!  At least consider the newest location on LV Blvd not far from Blue Diamond to eventually be open 24 hours.  Think about it, once that stadium opens... ;)
The staff at all he Black Bear locations never, ever disappoint.  They are bubbly, you can feel the warmth of their personalities and are they speedy!  I mainly frequent the Sahara\/Durango location now. That outdoor waiting are with the bears does have appeal!  However, Mindy the waitress is superb. Last time I finished dining, we hugged.  Seriously, go and be seated in Mindy's area and you will know why she's who she is- wonderful!  All the staff are here, but she's my favorite. Yes, as it it everyone has favorites. 
Food is always great quality ingredients, prepared quickly and arrive in front of you piping hot. I usually order the tuna melt.  Being the NYer I am, I do alter it.  Try it: tuna melt, rye toast, no lettuce, but make sure that cheese is Swiss. I en a provolone would do.  No, step it up and make the change away from cheddar\/yellow American cheese please;)
Always order a dessert, nope no favorite. WELL, I do.  Not telling, Simply try them all at once or over various visits!
Eat well!
A-ma-zing!!! Ok, so I am a little biased, because I volunteer here, but the reason I volunteer is because it is a great, cheap palce to shop! 

The store is run primarily by volunteers and all proceeds go to Maricopa County Animal Care and Control's special programs (i.e. spay and neuter programs). I admit that the store is fairly small, but that is so that we can keep our prices low and can remain true to our mission of providing funds for animals at the shelter.

Much of the clothes come from My Sister's Closet and are brand name clothes in great shape! I have stoped shopping at other thrift stores, because I am spoiled by the low prices ($2 for shirts, shorts, ties; $3 for pants, sweaters, blazers, dresses). I get so many compliments from my friends and co-workers and I am proud to say that my new Ann Taylor pants or Banana Republic sweater cost me less that $3 and has gone towards a good cause.

I highly encourage others to stop by and take a look. Happy shopping!!
This is a fun and fantastic little find in downtown Oakville! 

This cafe, which appears quite new, is a great alternative to Starbucks. 

Close your mouths, I know I just committed a crime (ALTERNATIVE to STARBUCKS??!?!) I LOVE Starbucks, but you know every time you go there, there are never any seats, because I swear, they hire people to sit there from 7am till 11pm on their Macbooks. 

Anyway, this place has no lack of seating. THere are several levels of pretty, clean white tables and booths, with comfy, modern, grey chairs.

In-between the booths are walls, which are mirrored, but have TVs in them as well...built into them! They look all futuristic and crap! 

Of course their are tributes to Ms. Monroe, but they're not slapping you in the face and you can certainly go here without feeling like you need to be obsessed. 

The menu for drinks is similar to what you find at Starbucks...they have cafe mochas and creme brule lattes and caramel lattes, etc. I didn't find their drinks quite as good as Starbucks' though. They were good, don't get me wrong, but Starbucks drinks really are above and beyond....SOOO minus one star.

BUT they have the cafe portion, which serves some cheesecakes and cupcakes and the like. I really enjoyed my cupcake actually, even though it was pretty pricey. The cakes look good, but the portions are pretty small, given the prices. It would be nice if they served more savory treats as well. I hadn't had lunch, so I ordered a bagel with cream cheese and I was given a good bagel, but packets of cream cheese...that's sort of chintzy in a place which looks as classy...sorry if I can't even get the same service in bagels as Tim Horton's??! Come on now! 

The service was polite, but a little slow and my friend commented that she had some questions about their tea selection (whether the herbal teas were caffeinated or not) and the girl working their had no idea. 

SOOO even though I really liked this place and would totally come back for a treat (great place if you want to sit and chat over coffee), it loses that one star.

That said, if you want a fun treat place and would enjoy a nice place to sit, this is a great option in Oakville!
Great spot if you're in the mood for Mexican in Old Town. Lovely patio seating. Food is yummy and service is also great. 

Table side guacamole is a must and they add pomegranate seeds which is a nice touch and burst of flavor. The Queso is not your traditional Queso dish and came with mushrooms, chorizo and grilled onions. I like the Queen Enchilada dish with shrimp. It's super creamy and filled with assorted cheeses. My husband loves the red sangria because it's super sweet. 

This is a nice place to bring out of towners so you can show them the beautiful riverwalk and take a walk around Old Town before\/after dining.
I don't even like seitan, or tacos really, but I sometimes find myself craving Round Corner's seitan tacos. Ample cilantro and lime make them super tasty and radish adds nice color and crunch. I love the double tortilla method which keeps the experience pretty neat-- I usually avoid tacos because they get messy, but these are manageable. The salsas that I have tried in the past have been terrible though, so the kitchen is a one trick pony when it comes to vegan options. The bartenders make great Pimms' cups (with cucumber!) and I really like the Carnation cocktail. The atmosphere of the bar is cool, the music is usually interesting and the back patio is to die for. Seriously, getting a table on the patio can be cut-throat, as seating is first come first serve (or a competition of attention and aggression) and is not managed by staff. I find the situation to be stressful. You usually have to sit down before the servers even clear\/clean the table (which makes me feel like an asshole), otherwise you'll lose it. It's kind of like a showdown in the wild west, sometimes resulting in a draw (two parties claim a table at the same time and a new sort of standoff begins). I think I could muster up a fourth star should they get a host to keep seating organized and clean on busy nights. Other than structural problems with service, I've had no real problems with the wait-staff.
This used to my go to spot for a little pampering, but they are quickly losing stars... 

The parking is terrible. The lot outside the nail salon has marked parking. They will tow or ticket if you park in a space marked for another business. The spots fill up quickly and I've had to park in the neighborhood and walk. It's fine walking in but not after your pedi. The chances of messing up your nails increases 100x. 

There are no massage chairs. The tall high back throne chairs are pretty but they don't feel great. I notice that after sitting for a while I start slouching and my lower back hurts. 

The way they have you pick polish is terrible. They took away all the bottles and now just give you swatches. The swatches are organized by brand and number. It's really hard to pick a color! I like to look at the colors and compare multi bottles and I can't do that anymore. 

The free wine is nice but there are other locations that offer that as well. Sorry, Cachet. I think we are breaking up.
This is the first time I have ever taken the time to review a restaurant on yelp. I eat out all the time, so this says a lot about the quality of this restaurant. Moreover, I am typing this on my Iphone, so you get the idea.

The meal was sublime, from start to finish. 

We started off with a watermelon ricotta salad. The fruit was juicy and sweet, the cheese was just salty enough and velvety, and it was served with thin slices of dehydrated (?) tomatoes... was quite the party in my mouth.

Then came the amuse-gueule, a delicate piece of smoked salmon cube, with delicious marinated cucumber and creme fraiche. It left us wanting more and at this point I was already worried that the mains were not going to live up to my expectations, as the previous dishes were so spot on.

It was no easy feat but the entrees managed to surpass our expectations, especially the mackerel. It was perfectly pan-fried, so crispy and tasty, with a tender centre. I usually hate ordering fish at the restaurant because it is ALWAYS too dry but this fish was perfection. It was served with fried kale and a foamy creamy sauce. I could have licked the plate, and actually regret not doing so.

The only sub-par dish was the duck magret; the sauce made of apples and pumpkin was overwhelmingly sweet and the brussels sprouts were pretty bland. 

For the finale, we were given a pre-dessert in the form of a homemade chocolate cherry truffle with peppery cream on top. It was just lovely, and at this stage of the meal we were wondering where we had landed, because the food was truly out of this world.

A chocolate verrine and lemon-orange creamy cake later graced our table. Once again, it did not disappoint. 

Service was a bit cold but very efficient and professional. It was one of the best meals I have had in a long time, and I already cannot wait to go back!
Now this is what a burger is supposed to taste like!

With so many "fancy" dedicated burger joints, it's unfortunate that many are quite underwhelming in the taste department. The burger should be top priority. 

I built my own burger but some of the menu creations looked pretty tasty as well. Most of the burgers average $11 and fries will cost you extra. They also have adult milkshakes but mixing alcohol and dairy has never appealed to me. 

The atmosphere is dim and moody, lots of space and dedicated areas to eat or just have a beer - a large spacious bar, sofas and regular dining tables and chairs. 

There weren't many patrons on a Sunday afternoon so service was good and the food came out quickly. 

I'm not sure why this location is listed as closed on Yelp, good thing I called to double check.
Have you ever wondered what a bob cut mixed with a mullet would look like?  I no longer have to wonder because that is the cut I got, and it is as bad as you think it would be.  Let me also add that because my hair is curly it looks even worse.  However the truly scary thing is I can't tell if it was on purpose or by accident. 

I am a new mother who rarely gets time now for things like haircuts and so I was pleased when I was able to snag a baby sitter and sneak away for a little me time.  I walked in without an appointment and to their testament they were able to fit me in which was wonderful.  That's where the wonderful ended.  The salon is small which I don't mind, but the decor looks like it's stuck in the 90's.  My stylist was nice, but I soon realized she was very chatty and that is coming from a stay at home mom who is usually desperate to talk to people.  I asked for a trim to get rid of damage and I was aware that this meant an inch would be coming off.  I remember asking her to just reshape what I already had which I can assure you was not a bob-mullet!  I have curly hair and the cut I had before was perfect because it was long layers which add some volume but the weight helps minimize frizz.  This stylist changed my cut, and went with short layers on the top and front and longer layers in the back.  YUK!

I was initially unsure of how I looked in the mirror, but my time was short and I couldn't really look it all over.  I wish I had!  When I got home I looked in the mirror and immediately saw a huge chunk of hair on the right side was longer.  She must have missed it which pissed me off because I paid around $75 and gave her my usual $20 tip I give my normal hairdresser (who works far away now, hence this little adventure)

Then the horror of seeing the mullet creation in the back of my head was the cherry on this crap pie.  So now you understand why I am unsure if this was by design or by accident.  And I don't know which makes me more irritated.  I mentioned this to someone I know and they said they had a similar experience (different stylist).

I would not go back, and would not send anyone I like there unless they want a bad hair cut.
This place is now called "Yes Cafe". Named changes recently but same friendly owners!!
I get foot reflexology massages often at least once or twice a month. Have gotten massages every where from Dallas to Houston to Tampa to even Taiwan. I chose the deep tissue special for $30 an hour and it came with hot stones and oil. The massage was excellent and I highly recommend this store to anyone visiting Las Vegas. It's about 10 minute drive from the strip
J'ai bien aimé mon expérience pour une 3ième année consécutive au Chapiteau du Cirque du Soleil à Montréal. J'ai aimé ce spectacle avec la disposition des éléments pour que tous les spectateurs puissent bien voir le spectacle. Par contre, j'ai trouvé que plusieurs numéros se ressemblaient ou n'avaient pas besoin toujours d'être plusieurs pour un numéro où seulement une personne était la vedette.

J'adore la musique, l'ambiance, le confort des sièges, le service à la clientèle. Ce que j'ai moins bien aimé c'est le prix faramineux de la boutique Cirque du Soleil. Je comprends que certains objets sont rares, mais payer 12-16$ pour une tasse..ou 8$ pour un aimant de frigo...j'aime moins. 

N'oubliez pas de manger et boire avant. 2 hot-dogs, un sac de chips et une boisson vous coûteront 20$. La bière est 11, 12$. BON SPECTACLE!
Ive always enjoyed comming here even as being an "adult" the entire l hotel has such a great atmosphere to be in. Ive stayed in every tower except for the manor section but other than that i always have a great time specially in the adventuredome not only do i get all day pass i become a child again plus it closes at 12 so if i wanna take a break i go up to my suite and go back whenever i want also the delievery to the rooms is amazing!!! So much in this casino makes me not want to leave plus the free shows . Thank you Circus Circus for always making my stay in vegas great!
Place is amazing. Great service, great food, friendly staff... Would recommend this for sure. Waiter gives great advice on apps\/main\/wine combinations.
Nice find in Toronto. It was a Tuesday evening, so it wasn't packed but had a typical after-work type crowd. Enjoyed a few beers, I'll suggest the Witbier. The Cream Ale is also a solid choice and the IPA had a good solid taste but not much hops. The honey wings were pretty good but may be a bit steep on price. Maybe hit up the wing night on Mondays instead. Good service at the bar made it a win.
I'm giving them one star as a 1\/2 star is not an option.  The owners have obviously given up and focused all their cash on the Plaza across the street, which is just lipstick on a pig.  This place is miserable and deserted.  You know you've got trouble when you make more money making part of the casino floor a large gift shop.  So sad, they used to have a great coffee shop.   Huge areas at the back of the building have been walled off, including the elevators to the now closed hotel.  If the owners are reading this, I hope they sell and find a buyer and soon.  This is a shame.
So... I have this thing about roses. If there are roses anywhere on it, or mentioned, or otherwise involved, I'm pretty much a dead cert to like it. But I confess I had some vague preconceptions of this place from the reviews I'd read and I expected something a little twee, a bit "quirky" in that slightly forced sense. So when I came here for the Yelp brunch I was surprised to find that from the outside it looks pretty much like any other relatively nice pub.

Well, to be fair, quirk it has in abundance inside. The halogen lights are shaded by upturned teacups in translucent bone china. Around the top of the room, hats in all styles and colours hang on rose-shaped hooks. Menus arrive in old copies of National Geographic. The teapot in which our tea arrived was an adorable porcelain cottage. But it's not a try-hard kind of place; despite the kooky notes, it's also a genuine, solid pub. It's cosy, warm, well-stocked with a good range of drinks.

I was transfixed, too, by the juicer, which provided me with apple juice so fresh and pulpy that I could stand my straw upright in it, and served with a merry slice of apple that presented the whole thing, rather charmingly, like a cocktail. That kind of fruity joy explains the hefty £3 price tag, which I would gladly pay again.

There was a good number of us, yet they managed to serve us all pretty quickly. My meal was the last to arrive but I didn't feel I'd been waiting an unfairly long time. The big breakfasts on griddles looked incredible and super-generous, and I heard good reports about the French toast too.

I went for Eggs Florentine. To be honest, I was a little disappointed with the eggs themselves; I like the yolks of my poached eggs to run free like liquid scamps on the playground of my food, but these smiled orangely up at me in regrettable stasis. I suspect that this might simply have been a side-effect of having to poach eggs for about half of our rather large party in quick succession, though; both the wilted spinach and the toast were done to perfection, so it was still a really lovely meal, and a snip at £5.95.

The whole experience was easily worth the long walk to Leith from my house (which also justified the indulgence... yum yum!) and I feel very certain I'll be back before too long to enjoy it all over again. Yup, this place is coming up smelling of roses!
This small Japanese restaurant serves freshly made sushi, sashimi, and a wide variety of other traditional dishes that are well prepared.  The staff is very helpful. Their happy hour is great and their prices are inexpensive for what you get..  I usually order off of the combination menu that allows you to build your meal with  I, 2 , 3, or 4 selections, depending on how hungry you are.
Essence was an impulse stop for me as I was driving on University. I decided  to stop in after reading "bakery and cafe" from their sign. As I pulled in, I noticed the line through the window of the tiny restaurant. I walked in and had to squish my way to the back of the line through people sitting at tables and people already in line. The restaurant is tiny but they do have a  patio for additional seating. Line moved pretty quickly but noticed their bakery display was pretty limited. This made me sad because I was excited to see all the goodies that a bakery would have offered. 

I went to order and asked the cashier her recommendations since this was my first time visiting. She recommended the salad (only a few to choose from) and the grilled cheese with tomato, mozzarella and basil sandwich. I went with the sandwich and was given the choice of mixed greens or potato salad. I chose mixed greens. I also decided to order a vanilla bean macaroon because I wanted to try a bakery item. Total (without drink) was over $11, so not super cheap. Drinks were expensive, even a can of soda was $1.25. 

I took the order to go and waited about 10 minutes for my food. When I got home, I was disappointed to see the mixed greens were literally big pieces of lettuce with a vinagrette rather than an actual salad with veggies. The sandwich was OK, the bread was really good. The macaroon was good, soft outside and gooey buttercream frosting inside. I didn't eat it all at once because I found the texture somewhat unappealing and a little too rich. 

I think I would come back for breakfast (I hear it's better) rather than during the busy lunch rush.
I recently got a new puppy "Sola". That of course means I need supplys, as my other dog "Luna" has her own beds and kennel. While I was walking around an employee who we believe was a supervisor approached us and ask if we needed help. She then went on to explain about this puppy coupon book. It was 19.99 and it gave you a discount on a kennel mat, which she said even though it said Kong mats they could use it for any of them. Then there was a discount on food bowls, she again said any kind. Discount on treats and food. Lastly there were so great discounts on training. Classes, doggie daycare etc. So we're thinking great this will help a lot. 

The kennels were pretty expensive, they have one thats a camping kennel. It's great as the dog gets old as she's a small breed and will me sleeping in it next to my bed. It was 59.99 but the one I purchased for my other dog at another business was 25. 

The bowl selection was okay, they was a lot of glass and plastic ones. I preffer the stainless steel. I found a nice one for a fair price. 

Food is the reason I come here. They have a great selection and hills makes a food Luna loves so we grabbed there puppy food and I though it was a good price at 15.00.

Treats a toys we had no issues finding.

When we went to check out the line was backed up and only one cashier. I thought this was going to become a nightmare quick as the customer at the register was a "complicated order". But the cashier noticed the line and got some help. 
This is were out visit went down hill. The lady that came up started ringing us up. Telling us nearly every item we got wasn't covered but the coupons. We tried to explain that we picked items that an employee directed us to. She just said "well who told you that, what's there name what do the look like." Lucky enough the supervisor walked by and the cashier didn't bother to ask her what she told us.  So we were just not going to get the coupon book. Then the camping kennel rang up as .01 so the second cashier said they cannot sale it. I told her you have it on the shelf with a price and item I'd number on the shelf that matches the item, what do you mean I cannot buy it. She said they .01 means they don't carry the item anymore and cannot sale it. It means they used to carry it. It's a kong brand that they have a large selection of sizes. They had 12 or more of varying sizes. Her logic blew my mind, "we used to carry it" hello I have the item in my hand so you clearly still do. They did not bother to ask a manager. Also we were not asking for a discount. So petsmart would have made 200.00 but instead I left everything and went to a cheaper competitor and got the same bed for half. 

I am loyal to company's that treat me well and value my business as well as empower there people to keep the sale.
I am not sure why it says closed. They are and have been open for over ten years. They were remodeled last year and it looks great. However each stylist is a remter so they are basically theee own businesses. So call for an appointment and avoid just walking in.
I had to be there in two hours. My dress, a sturdy and somewhat matronly double-breasted affair in tough, heavy stretch cotton, had arrived in the post that morning, and bore all the signs of having been posted. My flat, still not fully furnished, contained no iron and my attempts to tame the creases with hair straighteners were limping sadly to a halt. Oh no. Oh no oh no. This was to be a big night for me - how could I show up all crinkly?

"Good evening, Johnsons Elm Row?"
"Hi. Hi. Um. Hi. If I bring a dress in now, like RIGHT NOW, could you - sorry - could you just... iron it for me?"
"Just press?"
"Yes, that, yes, please."
"Just the one dress?"
(At a pitch audible to bats) "Yes."
"Certainly."

I tore up the road with the dress flying out behind me and fell gasping against the glass door, which swung open. A cheery blonde lady materialised from behind racks of coats and suchlike. "You're wanting a dress pressed?" A twinkle of indulgent amusement, perhaps, but no tutting, no officiousness, no bustling haste to get this ridiculous girl's frantic pleading out of the way as fast as possible.
"Yes please. Thank you. I'll come back in half an-"
"Give me five minutes."

She vanished again behind the racks and I gazed around at the spacious counter and the things on display. There was a good view of the street - a very nice place to wait for five minutes. She was back in three - all smiles and radiant creaselessness. I have always been supremely wary of dry-cleaners, fearing financial meltdown for little return, but this was, under the circumstances, an unexpectedly enjoyable experience. While she took the payment (less than a fiver! I had anticipated considerably higher, given the urgency of my request) her assistant hastily and elegantly packed my dress into one of those plastic covers with a hanger. I was back in my flat within 15 minutes. Pretty awesome.

Yes, I know it's just a dry cleaner, and they sort of cleaned my dress while it was dry, so they were just doing their job. But the level of service and the attitude of the staff made this altogether a joy. I can't think that many people walk (or in my case, run) away from a dry cleaner's shop actually feeling a huge ton happier. So if ever a dry cleaner deserved five stars, it was now.
I used a Groupon for this salon and had my cut and color with Kasey and I must share that she did a great job. I always feel more assured when my stylist is put together herself and Kasey herself is beautiful and loves to work on hair!  The color was great, the cut gorgeous, loved my blowout. Highly recommend!
Cool holiday shop with local vendors and business run by women. The space was laid out well and there was something for everyone. Sugar Creek had the beer flowing and the DJ was pumping out N'Sync Christmas Jams. Can't wait for the next pop-up!
The Town Square shopping center is a pretty interesting place because the mix of shops & activities is good for locals & tourists.  The wait at Brio on Mother's Day was 90 minutes, so GameWorks provided a much-needed distraction for Baby C.  Hat tip to Phil T for mentioning this place.  Otherwise, I would have never known about it.

I noticed a few games were straight-up imports from Japan, and other games that I had never seen anywhere else, such as Kung-Fu Panda (so much fun), Transformers and Mario Kart.  There's the usual skee-ball, and some air hockey games as well.  I paid an absurd amount of $ for Baby C to get candy and some water gun made in Taiwan, but that's not the point.  The point is 90 minutes went by pretty quickly, and Baby C was totally entertained.  Not entirely happy about paying a deposit for a card, since I gave it back to GameWorks at the end of the day.  But it's Vegas, so you're not even thinking about it.
Union is a pretty nice bar and grill in suburbia that is not named Moxies or Earl's, although the decor of the place will certainly remind you of them. It's a *union* of chiq and suave ambiance with a large space which makes it a good place for a *social* meet up with friends, family, or whoever else you meet with. 

The food started out mediocre out of the gates: the calamari ($10) was under-seasoned and the truffle fries ($8) were soggy. Not a good start.  Luckily, the entrees were much better. The almond crusted chicken fingers ($14) are breaded in an almond crumb batter and served with 3 sauces (mustard, bbq and ranch). It was a delightful "union" of flavours and textures; a really nice twist on your typical fingers and something I'd order again, and a dish that will get the table talking about - yay to *social*.

The salad with fig, mango and candied pecans ($10) *union*ized-together nicely, and you can add some protein on top for an extra $4. It was tasty and my protein of choice, steak, was well cooked, though a bit too cold. 

The flatbread ($10-$12 I think) looked alright, nothing to be *social* about there.

There's also a decent selection of wine ($8\/glass, $30\/bottle) and beers (about $6-8 a pint) to really keep you *social*ly lubricated .

A 3.5 in my books.
Darin is the best! My life has changed drastically for the better since going to see him. I had been frustrated with healthcare and looking for an alternative to traditional medicine and this is the real deal. His treatments have done things for me that medicine simply cannot do. He has helped me with my autoimmune issues, allergies, hormone imbalances, anxiety and overall wellbeing. After my treatments I feel happier, calmer and rejuvenated. Such a pleasure to work with and makes a seemingly scary treatment very comfortable. He really goes above and beyond to help his clients and I highly recommend him you are looking to improve your quality of life.
Okay, so I definitely consider Club Cycle to be the "original" 100% spin studio of the South Hills.  Who knew there would be so many options for indoor cycling in the South Hills?  It's been cool to watch them grow from a small studio in Dormont (when my Cousin first started going & was obsessed & recommended I try), to a larger space in Castle Shannon, to a second studio in Beaver County.  I -WISH- they were in Beaver when I lived there, because I had to drive all the way to Cranberry!  

I've taken part in their 90 minute classes, their 45 minute classes, and their 60 minute classes.  I've had three different instructors including the owner.  LOVE taking the owners class.  I did feel called-out when another instructor said folks that go over on RPMs aren't working hard enough (my suggestion would be to coach differently and say "hey, just a reminder to the class to stay within this RPM range" ... heck, there could be some strong cyclists in the class as well!).  The atmosphere is very club-like and the DJ and videos make the class fly by.  I really enjoy that because it can feel monotonous after awhile (it is a stationary bike afterall!)

Honestly, what sealed the deal (and if it weren't for the aggressive coaching style they would get 5 stars but I feel like that's really important) was the customer service!  I bought a new pair of cycling shoes there (my old ones bit the dust after 10 years) and I noticed they had a crack in them three days after I got them!  The bearded guy at the front desk was SO nice and replaced them with a better pair, no questions asked.  I could not have been happier until he gave me a free wrench for future clip adjustment!  Ahh!  Perfect.  Honestly, I was blown away.  I think those of us that are avid cyclists know how annoying it is when a clip comes loose and to have that to keep in my gym bag is perfect!  A+ on that for sure.  

Finally, I think the culture of this place is really important.  I don't feel the need to wear high-end athletic wear to fit in unlike some other gyms and the instructors don't come around and add resistance (yes, that's happened to me and yes I never went back).  All in all, a very positive experience here!
I tried to pay for my 2 drinks (which at this store are easily 20% more in cost) with my Starbucks card. After the boy at the register manually put my number in 3 times he said "we can't take your Starbucks card, we're not owned by Starbucks". If that is indeed the case, and you don't accept Starbucks cards, you should first, rip the name off of the building, and secondly, put a large sign on both your doors that says, "We Aren't Really A Starbucks, So We Can't Take Starbucks Payment".  Maybe a few more times getting twenty dollars of made drinks on the counter, left behind unpaid for, will help you figure out who owns the store. By the way, it's a really nice store.
As always Chris is friendly and personable! That female bartender is no longer there:)
The truffle burger was the most amazing burger I've ever had!!!! My boyfriend got the chicken pot pie and he loved it also. Price wasn't too bad for Vegas!! Proportions are great too, I was stuffed and couldn't finish my meal!! 
Must say, I would come back any time!!
Okay, I am Italian and from Chicago so that makes me a Pizza Snob but I do like Mellow Mushroom here in Ballantyne. Went today, Have been there many times before when it was very crowded, today I went after the lunch crowd, It was great service and great Pizza. We ordered the Holy Shitake, a Pizza covered with Mushrooms, Chives, a Garlic Ailoi and Truffle Oil...Delicious..the kind of Pizza that makes you think about wanting it again.. ..over and over! Wonderful-a couple of nice glasses of wine and the afternoon was great....Try it..
I love Green. All of my friends (veg or not) love it as well. They never have any qualms about going to Green for a meal (or treat). I go to Green a few times a month, and always leave happy and full! You can't go wrong with the wings. I typically  try the special if there is one. My go-to is the Original G. It's a buffalo faux chicken sandwich-sooooo good! I am mildly obsessed with their wing sauce. Other faves of mine are the BBQ Chkn Sandwich, the Ranchero Salad (Sub buffalo sauce for bbq), the Spicy Thai Peanut Noodle Bowl, and of course Soynamis. 
The staff is mostly pleasant and accommodating. Green is a great place to people watch, too. Yes, it definitely has a hipster feel, but there is quite the variety in their cliental. 
Green maybe not offer the healthiest and lightest of vegan fare but definitely some of the best tasting! Highly recommended!
A(nother) pastry craving had me stop at two bakeries this morning on the way to work.  I randomly  passed by Nova, saw their sign, and decided to stop in to see what they had.  I already had a chocolate croissant and doughnut in hand from Truscott Bakery, but too much butter is never a bad thing (right?).

I'm going to preface my review by saying that I had a good experience, but I've only tried ONE thing here: the apple turnover. Everything did look good though. Since I've only tried one thing, and had a monster pastry craving at the time, I'm going to give it 3 stars for now (it's probably 3 and a half) and I'll update when I make another trip. Hey, what can I say, I'm like the teacher you love to hate, I don't give easy marks :)

First, it's fairly large for a bakery, they sandwiches and hot food, complete with a sit down section, a small grocery section and a good num ber of pastries and baked breads. 

Pastries were about $1.35 for each (and most of it looked great: cinnamon twists, strudles, turnovers, pies looked awesome, eclaires and various puff pastries, tarts). Bagels were $0.50.

After tasting their apple turnover, I'm going to go back and try some of their other offerings, because it was pretty good!  I microwaved the turnover when I got into the office (we don't have a toaster oven, unfortunately) but it was still really good, the crust was flaky and crispy and the filling with apple-y and sweet. 

Their breads smelled and looked delicious so I'll have to pick up a loaf of something next time 'round.  As mentioned above, pies also look really good so I'm going to have to go carb-heavy one of these days and just try out some of their other things. It was busy (especially for 9:15 am on a Tuesday) so the turnover here must be pretty high and I assume it's fairly popular. 

I'll be back and I'll update my rating accordingly.
I've been here about 4 times now and each time I see an improvement on their service and speeds. I really enjoy the quality of the food here. The sushi tastes fresh and the other foods are quite tasty as well. Their rolls are well made but the last time I went they didn't have spider rolls which are my favourite so I was a little disappointed with that.  Minus that one set back ordered lots of sashimi, a variety of rolls, and the kids that were with us (under 3) went to town on the avocado and shrimp tempura.
There are some other things to be aware of like they have the leaf which is supposed to represent a vegetarian option beside some obvious meat items... Small things like that I find amusing though.
This is now probably my favourite sushi place in town and even though it's out of the way for me, about 12km one way, I'll continue to make that trip to eat here. There are other sushi places closer to me but I still prefer California Roll.
Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I do.
Thumbs up: good prices, a tad cheaper than some of the other options in the area. Fresh toppings and this spicy pickled something (garlic and eggplant maybe?) was especially good.

Thumbs down: Menu inside is quite different from the pamphlets they give out. Some of the options on the pamphlet aren't actually available (i.e. Donair (Beef &Lamb) wrap\/sandwich

Schwarmas. How do you differentiate between them? Imho, you need some good, distinctive toppings. The main components of Lezzet's Chicken schawarma is good, but fairly run of the mill. The veggies were fresh and the sauces were mostly average. There was one topping, a spicy pickled veggie that was particularly distinctive, it added a nice kick to the pita, but it doesn't quite add enough to put this place over the top compared to Pita and Grill which is up the street. It's a toss up between the two.

The prices are a bit lower than other options in the area and the restaurant is clean. Chicken Schawamra pita came to $5.50 after taxes. See pictures for additional pricing.

If you're looking for it, it's in the corner of the plaza ACROSS from Rockwood mall.
I appreciate the friendly bar staff and super quick refills at this pseudo gastro pub slash sports bar.  

Both at the inside bar and front outside tables we've had lovely service from nice down to earth ladies.  I even requested an all lime margarita with no mix and was happy with her version.  She even said "the mix hurts my stomach..." We received quick service without that weird feeling of being watched or listened to.

I have yet to try the food but I hear they have a half baked cookie with ice cream.
Went again tonight and tried the pineapple beef. Awesome! Actual slices and chunks of beef- not cheap meat like you'd find at a Chinese delivery place. Lo Mein would've filled 4 plates if we made it that far.
Mariah does a wonderful job on my underarms! She's so friendly and quick with everything she does! I highly recommend her! Plus I love the fact how clean this place is and efficient they are!
Highly recommend Good Karma Cleaning!

I was interested in a one-time spring cleaning and so many services I contacted wanted to go through a lengthy phone call about our space and expectations etc. Good Karma had a very well thought out online form and I was contacted by email - my preferred method - later the same day. 

We had a 3 hour cleaning, all you need to provide is a vacuum\/swiffer, mop and a roll of paper towels. I was working from home the day she came but stayed in our second bedroom\/office which didn't need a cleaning. She worked so hard and so fast to cover our entire condo. I was thrilled with the result. I might end up indulging in this service more often!
I'm impressed with the pedicure that Vintage Nail Salon provided. I was in need of a pedi and near South Park Mall. I had a really bad experience over at a salon in the mall, so I got on Yelp and found Vintage. It's on the second floor of the small shopping center across from South Park Mall. Plenty of parking in the lot. Walking in, I noticed a grand opening sign. The space inside was large and very clean. The ladies greeted me, asked me what service I wanted, and then instructed me to pick a color. They then asked me what scent I would like for my pedi scrub and lotion. The choices were cucumber, green tea, or apple. I chose green tea and sat in the pedi chair they had ready for me. They offer beverages - water, soda, or red & white wine. I asked for a glass of red, beware: it's a sweet wine - Think arbor mist. 

The pedi itself was nice. They use OPI cuticle, base and top coats. The polish wall is expansive. The price is right. $35 for a pedi but the service is equivalent to deluxe pedis at most salons. They do a scrub with massage, masque with massage, lotion with massage, and hot towel. Love how many times they massage! I'll be back next time I'm in the area and looking for a little pampering. 

My only feedback would be to offer an express pedi and what's with the $70 pedi?! Because fresh cucumber? Really? I'd rethink the pricing on that service.
We started coming to the store after having awful experience at a different location and my review is specifically about the employees.
We are going through rough times with Kay and Neil Lane but the manager, assistant manager and one of the youngest employees have been phenomenal to us. We are dealing with an engagement ring that after a long and tiring experience has been finally on my finger for a couple of months, but unfortunately stones keep on falling off of it. 
It has been very frustrating and of course I don't understand why this keeps on happening but the fact that they care enough to re-check all stones every time the ring comes back from their office and now are contemplating what the options are to solve our problem just make us feel better as in we are actually being assisted and something will be done about it.
I have browsed this store several times while shopping at Kierland Commons, but didn't purchase anything until I received a gift card for my birthday.  After looking around I realized my best bet would be to try some of their pants, since they came in long sizes (a big plus!) and I could use a new pair for hiking.  Lisa was super helpful, and asked what activities I usually do and what I was looking for in a pant.  She knows her stuff....and she coaches Master's Swimming at The Village at DC Ranch with me, but I'm not biased!  I swear!  She helped me pick out a pair that fit amazing, and at minimum I'll definitely wear them for winter hiking or running errands.  I have yet to determine if they leave a butt crack sweat mark during hard core workouts.  Ha! 

I'll stop by here if I need some more pants, although they were expensive ($78.00)....hopefully they last.  Most of the other clothing wasn't my style, maybe for older woman or for those just looking for casual active wear rather than workout clothes.
Love coming here. Nicole has been doing my hair and my son's hair for about 5 years now. She is very polite and takes her time. I will continue on coming here.
Times have changed. Unfortunately, I am no longer a Sun Devil. I am not in between classes and certainly don't look the age of a college student. Therefore, I feel like I stick out like a sore thumb at this particular location. Do I care? Nope. In-N-Out is good no matter what college campus it is on :) As with most of their locations, GREAT customer service and a fantastic product. Nothing like a grilled cheese (animal style) to make you feel a bit better about life.
After a very long flight it was suggested we check out Citizens for a late dinner. We asked to be seated inside because the band playing in the bar outside was SO loud. It didn't make a difference. Our server greeted  us quickly and was very enthusiastic. We ordered the fish & chips and the tuna melt plus waters. Food presentation was beautiful.  unfortunately the fish was over cooked and the potato salad, al though made in house, lacked flavor. In the end our bill was $50 for a mediocre meal. The fish and chips was definitely over priced, $26!
I love just walking around the store, flipping through books. The hours are convenient. I have trouble studying\/focusing at home so I like to here to read and\/or write. However, I find it incredibly lame that there are not power outlets in the Starbucks cafe area. Perhaps even more lame, the outlets found elsewhere around the store have locks over them. It's kind of like so you want us to come, buy your coffee, stay- but not for tooooo long.
Local dive bar experience!  Authentic Phoenix experience squished behind the Starbucks.

Pros:
Decent prices
$2 mystery shots
Clean bathroom
A variety of seating options 
Friendly outgoing patrons of all ages
We've checked out this place three times because we really wanted to make it our neighborhood spot because we live really close, but it fell short all three times. The first time we went we waited 45 minutes to get a server's attention. It was during a Pens game so we made allowances but the food really wasn't very good.  Second time, the service was better but they don't have Bud Light on tap and we really don't like Coors or Miller and especially not Labatt. The bottles we ordered were warmish.  Third time we went we gave up and agreed on the way out that we gave it a good shot but the convenience is just not worth the food. If we go back it will only be to drink.
Friendlier service than Papa CEO. Similar in quality, service (fast), menu, and interior to Papa CEO. "Good enough". 

Why are they even side by side???
Loved the drink special-a Moscow mule made w bourbon, and the good was quite good! I had the smashed chips, they were spicy and amazing-more like sliced potatoes covered in delicious toppings. my friends got the Seoul chicken and thought it was pretty good (although in pretty sure they expected a larger portion haha) I've been looking forward to checking this place out and I'm happy with the atmosphere and bartenders, had a lot of fun here.
Have returned to Toss't a few times since my original review, and I'm hooked :)  

Everytime I've eaten here it's been amazing, and I may be guilty for the addiction of my co-workers as well.  So good!  The last couple of times I've been there I've ordered a custom salad with the amazing ginger dressing I mentioned in my review, and I am so in love.  Do yourself a favor and go there.  go now!
I absolutely love this dish but decided to step outside the box and try something different I ordered the southwest veggie burger without cheese with a side if black beans! The veggie burger was delish and had good spicy taste to it the black beans were cooked to perfection! As always the service is always friendly!!!
Good service.  Came here as I'm waiting for my dog to get released from the vet. Cold beers relaxing atmosphere. Only second time would come again if I'm in the area for.some Mexican.
Had two different experiences, went once for a facial w\/ acne add on and loved it so much that I went back to try out their hair stylist. 

Let's start off with the facial: It was fabulous. The room was all the way back away from the louder area of the salon\/spa so it was really quiet. I was so happy about that because that is the worst thing-listening to other people in the hallway while you're trying to relax. The lady who performed the service was amazing and so skilled. I melted in her hands and it was the best facial i've ever had. 
They had some offer as I was checking out that I would be entered into a raffle for prebooking appointments which I did- but left the ticket on the counter. Called back 10 minutes after I left and all I got was a sorry :\/ 

For the haircut: This will break down into another two sections: the haircut and the style. For the cut itself I was not displeased, but I wasn't in love with the cut either. It doesn't seem like any weight was taken out of my hair and the layers weren't as distinct as I normally have them. If I had gone for a style alone I would have left one star. It was a blowdry that I would have expected from someone still in school. My hair was a big frizz ball and didn't look like I had just come from a salon and spent $55 for a level 4 stylist. (one of their mid-high stylist)

As I left I asked the front desk what they thought, they thought I looked great, very unenthusiastically ;) I took a picture and sent it to their manager--she offered a free style. Great, but I wasn't too excited to back anytime soon. 

I'll be back for another facial--but still searching for a good stylist!
While staying at the hotel we took in a movie here. Totally enjoyed this theatre. Most comfortable seats I've ever experienced at a movie theatre.
Man, did anyone else get hit by that powerful hail-tastic burst of heavy rain yesterday? I was driving to Carlsbad Tavern when the clouds unleashed buckets upon buckets of rain on my car. By the time I got there the rain had subsided to a drizzle and it made for the absolute perfect atmosphere as I walked up the wooden planks into the cave-like atmosphere of Carlsbad Tavern.

But then I looked to the right and saw an empty lagoon with tchotchke plastic turtles and fish upended and scattered atop PVC pipes in the concrete enclosure. I can accept the fact that they wouldn't keep that filled during the summer though. It's a waste of water with all the evaporation, although I'd really like to come here when the waterfall moat thingy is functioning because it looks like it would be great ambiance for a fun dinner!

I got there 15 minutes late and ended up having to wait another 15 minutes for my mom and aunt to arrive (what can I say, we're a punctual family). So I sauntered up to the bar and ordered a margarita on the rocks with salt. Since it was on happy hour it cost me only $3.75 and was a smooth combination of tequila, triple sec and sweet and sour mix. For only four bucks this well concoction was one of the better margaritas in recent memory. Chile pepper lights around the bar with all sorts of bat related memorabilia managed to be campy fun rather than campy trashy and gave me plenty to observe as I was waiting.

Feeling like the traditional Mexican munchies, I ordered the tricolor chips with two salsas. This was an unfortunate choice. The salsa de casa was very coarsely chopped, which made it really hard to dip or spoon onto a chip, and was extremely heavy on tomatoes with few other discernable flavors. The tomatillo salsa tasted okay but was also chopped so coarsely it was like layering strips of tomatillo on chips. The chips weren't too bad, but they were reminiscent of oil they've been using to crisp chimichangas in for the past week. I've worked in food service and I know what old oil tastes like.

But the conversation with my aunt and mom more than made up for the disappointing appetizer, and it cost two whopping bucks so I totally got what I paid for, although it is a little disappointing that they don't come complimentary.

Once we were seated in the main dining room, I was pleased by the atmosphere and decor (stuffed bats hanging from the ceiling! high seat booths with comfy cushions! cool copper light fixtures! rock walls and a huge floor to ceiling rock feature with vegetation!), which managed to maintain a cave-like atmosphere while still being inviting. We placed our order with a very friendly server that was a natural at making small talk and joking around, instead of coming off as peeved that we were taking too long to examine The Daily Guano. I also liked the more open ended, "Is there anything I can do for you?" Rather than the usual leading questions like, "Can I get you something to drink? Do you know what you want to eat?"

I ordered the Enchantment Platter so I could try a little bit of everything, a chicken enchilada, carne adovada burrito, a chile rellano and a sopapilla. When it came out I was pretty disappointed by the presentation. It was smothered in so much sauce and cheese that it was difficult to discern just what the hell I had on my plate and it looked like my burrito had anointed the surrounding items with a liberal splash of greasy red sauce. It most definitely could have done with two plates instead of just one. 

(I'll admit it. It really, really pissed me off. That gut reaction made me want to rate this place around 2 stars instead of 4. I have issues with food presentation. I rearrange every sandwich I order at a restaurant to ensure even distribution of ingredients. I don't care if things are touching and mixing it up, but it better be doing so in an aesthetic manner.)

But once I dug in it turned out to be a delicious meal! The chicken enchilada with tomatillo and green chile was deliciously cheesy with huge chunks of chicken. The carne adovada was tender but relied a bit too heavily on some weird tomato flavor that was thickened with what tasted like cornstarch, solo it was weird, but when the burrito entrails leaked all over the place it added a delicious flavor to the meal. The chile rellano was pure pork and cheese, a dense and delicious concoction nested atop rice and black bean. Rice was generic, black beans were delish. And I've got enough leftovers for three lunches, all for only $12.95! 

Psst! Don't get the habenero burger unless you want to shit fire for the next week. I've heard that from so many people that it must be true! It's not served with a complementary glass of milk for no reason...
The wait and line can seem intimidating but I finally went to Farmhouse for Sunday brunch. The wait was 15 min, no big deal. If there's nobody outside,  write your name and party number on the clipboard outside to get your name down on the list. We went inside and the restaurant is so charming but small. Tables get turned quickly. We were seated in a booth and given a menu with one side breakfast and one side lunch. I went with the Belgian waffle and my fiance had the #18 scrambler. Food came out quickly and portions are just right. Food was decent, I thought my fiance's food was better than my waffle. Prices are good, much better than other breakfast options nearby. I would come again.
Henry and Kristy are just the best!! Been going for years now. Friendly staff and my hands and toes are always looking amazing!! They are my go-to nail team! I am always referring people to them when I get compliments on my nails!
Greetings everyone, My experience with the Skywater Staff members have been absolutely amazing.  I recently moved in from New York City to  Arizona with a career opportunity. When I first arrived on the property I was greeted by Courtney Hunt who was extremely helpful. At the time I was searching for  Studio Apartments but all that was available was one bedroom Apartments. Courtney advised me to take the one bedroom and when a studio opens up I would be able to transfer to the studio. I signed the lease and moved my belongings into the apartment. As I entered and exit the property I was always greeted by the friendly staff members. I spend four weeks in the one bedroom until I was approached by Manager Hector Soto who had a Studio Apartment available for rent. I immediately accepted the offer and completed the paper work for the transfer. The following day Courtney handed me my keys to my Beautiful studio apartment that I currently live in. I have to commend  Courtney Hunt, Hector Soto, Jacqueline Rendon and Sarah Sanchez  they made my experience of Arizona unforgettable Thanks Again.
I've always wanted to try Pinches Tacos but their Las Vegas location was in Downtown. As a local, I try to avoid going to the strip or the old strip for that matter because of traffic. So imagine my excitement when I learned that they opened a new location in Spring Valley! 

My boyfriend and I went here for dinner last night (Wednesday). We were immediately greeted by who we later on learned as "Javier", one of the Anaya brothers - creator of the awesome Gringos Tacos. He gave us a couple of suggestions from their menu so we decided to get the combo to be able to try almost most of it: Gringos, AlPastor, Asada, Shrimp and Fish Tacos. Everything tasted wonderful! It was so delicious we told everyone we know that they must try this place. 

However their grand opening might not be until mid-November (or so we're told), so if you do decide to swing by, just remember to BYOB. Overall, this place has impressive food and it's always a plus when you are treated like family. This will definitely keep us coming back for more!
I must offer a disclaimer as I share this review, I've been coming to Duckworth's for years. I'm a BIG fan of their beer selections and the Duck's version of a Philly Cheesesteak! BUT their inability to serve hot fries is an ever present issue. A question, on their in house written survey suggest they've heard the problem before. It would seem, Mg't is well aware of the problem but choose's to do nothing. Even McD's has found a way to keep fries hot! Ask for chips......
Came here since my friend recommended them to me. Got a shellac manicure and I'm very pleased. They were kind, gentle, and took their time to make sure I was happy with my manicure. But here's a tip: bring cash. They charge a machine fee if you pay with card. Overall, I am happy and I would come here again. 
Update: went for a second time and I'm even more pleased, Cherry?? I think that's her name did an amazing job!! I would definitely recommend her!
For a first timer it was crucial. They are too fast and literally uses five strips and rips your vagina off. The worst place so far.
This place is the best, feels like home. Went in to get a new console and jake helped me to infinoty and beyond with the best customer setvice and game knowledge ill be back soon thank you jake
I love The Yard, however, the Market Square location isn't my favorite. My friends and I have gone after work a couple of times and the hosts\/hostesses have always made it so uncomfortable for us as far as seating us around happy hour. The tables are somehow always reserved except for maybe a few so we also feel like a burden coming in. Other than that awkward encounter, the waiting staff is typically very friendly. If you aren't at the bar, sometimes you might have to wait a little for a drink, but it's not a huge deal. Their pretzels are DELICIOUS and filling for an app! The happy hour has decent prices and they have a fun selection of beers!
Anyone who rates this restaurant anything less than 5 stars needs to go to the doctor and get their brain checked. The customer service and food is always on point and they are so consistent. Time and time again my wife and I go and we never have one complaint. They have an amazing formula going on there and if they remain on top of their game, they will be there for a long time.
I decided to try this place on taco Tuesday since the tacos are only 1.00!!! I ordered two vegetarian tacos. The tacos were absolutely delicious they came on corn tortillas with your choices of beans and toppings!!! I also love this place because it is vegetarian friendly if you don't want meat you can get tofu which is a huge plus. You also get chips with access to the salsa bar. The chips provided to me were not so good they tasted over fried and oily the salsa bar was good though because it allows you the option to try a variety of salsas. I'm happy to say that I found a great place to grab Tacos on Tuesdays!!!!
Rachel's kitchen is a little cafe in Summerlin near the I-215 on S Towncenter Dr. It is not very big at all.

The dining area has about 10 small tables maybe. There is a counter where you order your food and then the server brings it to you. They also offer seating outside. I always get the chicken sandwich and a salad. They have plenty healthy items on the menu to choose from. That's why I like this place. They have good burgers too.

If you want a healthy quick lunch, stop in here.
Greetings was good, the food is good but our server takes forever but then again he is alone .. we all did 3 diff checks and he wrote our order down but then he did gave us an extra plate that we all didn't order thats kinda weird .. mango black tea was really sweet, I didn't like cucumber salad .. its weird with soysauce.. the fried rice with beef was awesome but I ordered the lamb and gizzard skewer its good but then it has the same seasoning hmm ..
Everything ordered was tasty. Steak. watermelon salad. Very cool to watch the kitchen. Cool vibe located downtown. Also has roof deck w bar. Fun spot that's often a wait. Interesting food and interior.
Very fast drive thru. My bacon burrito was a little on the soft bacon side for me. Ask for cruncy and it would have been a ten. I added pico to it great flavor combo as good as at home. Tortillas were fresh always a plus.
Agréable endroit pour faire des promenades , de l'exercice , du vélo. l'atmosphère est aussi propice  pour  écrire des textes  issus de notre imaginaire.  Le payasage est super . Il faut prendre des photos .
Yummy food!  Decent service.  Great prices!  The only downside is the environment, something about the decor put me off a bit, but that wouldn't stop me from eating there again!
I'm from Texas on business in Phoenix. I had the grilled fish tacos they were delicious. Fresh with good flavor. I would recommend them to others. They even have a salsa bar. The only thing is their POS system is outdated, it would help to have a better description on receipts for expense purposes.
I recently went to The Lotus  Acupuncture & Wellness Center for acupuncture treatment from Zach because I had caught a bug that was going around. After two treatments over two days I felt almost 100% better while others seemed to have the bug four to five days. Treatment seems to have helped. I highly recommend.
My review is only for the Noodle Bar, I would probably come to Momofuku for Daisho next time. The service here was bad. Our servers didn't bother to pay attention to us, and without asking, she gave us the bill before our dessert even arrived!

-Pork Buns - hoisin, scallion, cucumber - $10: I love the pork buns in Momofuku, but it's not something that I would come back for just to have. For $10, these didn't have enough cucumber or scallion. I wish it would have had something pickled to add some tart to the buns and balance the flavour out. In any case, these were delicious and the pork just melt in your mouth, mhmm so good. 

-Winter Ramen - smoked chicken, squash, kale, egg - $15: although this time they improved a bit with the broth, it was still lukewarm, not hot like other authentic Japanese ramen joints. The broth lacked flavor and I didn't taste the kale at all. That small yellow lump in the center is the squash and when mixed with the broth, the entire dish turned too sweet so I don't understand why they felt the need to add squash onto the dish? Also, I'm surprised the egg was poached, hence it had a very runny egg yolk, which is completely different from a traditional Japanese ramen... Normally the egg should be soft-boiled, with the egg white just set and an almost runny egg yolk. The best part of the dish is perhaps the chicken. It was cooked perfectly and the sauce seemed to be a teriyaki sauce? Very delicious and flavorful.

-Milk bar soft serve- Twist of Cereal Milk and Fried Apple Pie - $8:  I prefer the cereal milk instead of the fried apple pie. The fried apple pie was overly sweet whereas the cereal milk was done just right. I remember there was a slight salty taste to the cereal milk soft serve, it was really unique and overall, delicious!
Absolutely amazing, went in with the worst shoulder pain that I had for about 2 months. Angela did a great job it was totally worth the money and mu husband and I will be returning.
Great place! Excellent service. When I told the server it was our first time he immediately offered us samples of their most popular dishes - now that's good service! 

The reviews about the etouffee are true. It is slammin and I ate about half of my husband's plate! I got their BBQ shrimp and it was good but the sauce was unique and definitely not your typically BBQ sauce so just go into it knowing that. Great portions.  Side salad was excellent. Wasn't a huge fan of the green olive coleslaw but I had to try it because I've never heard of those flavors put together. Garlic was amazing! 

My biggest reason for giving them 4 instead of 5 stars is kinda petty- they don't have beignets!! And that is so very Cajun and New Orleans. Our server said he had multiple requests for them in the past week so hopefully they start making them soon! If they do, I'll change my review to 5 stars!
Verde Valley did a few thousand dollars in landscaping for us and did a decent job. At that time, John seemed very knowledgeable and nice.  Some of the plants (one in ground and eight potted) died within a few weeks. At the time they were also doing a monthly maintenance at our property. After some major phone tag with john and finally delaying payment for our most recent monthly invoice by a week, his assistant called and left us a message threatening to send our latest invoice to collections. Nice. When we finally spoke to john he said he would replant the plants that had died and plant the one in ground with a different soil to give it a better chance of absorbing water and keeping some moisture around the plant. As for the potted plants that had also died, but that he had initially recommended, We replaced 5 of them ourselves and he said he would replace the other 3 and charge us the difference (if any) between what he was going to replace them with and what we had paid for those 3.  
After a few weeks his guys showed up and replaced the in ground plant, adjusted the drip, and left. Within 2 days the replacement was dead. Still no word on replacing the potted plants. 
I called john and he got nasty and barked at me as soon as I told him the replacement plant had already died... Told me he has them at his nursery and has planted them all over the valley and they're all fine. Nothing he could do. But "nice" john was definitely gone. Then he asked me what I expected. I told him I wasn't asking for him to replace it again, but that clearly the guys didn't plant it in mulch or whatever he had suggested. I asked him about the 3 potted plants he agreed to replace and he said he would do it but charge me for the plants and labor. He denied ever agreeing to replace them and charge me just the difference in cost to him. The he barked some long lecture and ended with "listen ma'am - I don't know what you expect. What do you want??" Clear by his aggressive tone he wasn't prepared to do anything. I said "nothing". He said snarkily "goodbye then!" and hung up on me. 
I'm done with these guys. Nice as pie when they want your business but when that's done there's no backing up promises. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.
Oh dahling, how I love Targét (pronounced Tar-shay for you uncouth peasants).

Rodeo Drive who? Fifth Avenue what? 

Lol, no but seriously, who doesn't love Target? This particular Target is very clean, bright, well stocked, has a little grocery store, a little food court and a Starbucks, what is there NOT to love? I can buy a video game, Starbucks and a loaf of bread in the same place. LOVE.

Aside from that, the lines always go quickly with efficient and friendly workers. And NO SELF CHECK OUT! I hate those as it usually gives the store an excuse to only hire like 2 people for the entire store.

And come on, everyone feels just a teensy bit classier having chose Target over the big blue store down the street. Don't deny it!
I went here for dinner two nights in a row, the food and service was impeccable.

The roasted pork belly was to die for. It had the crispiness and just the right amount of fat.  I don't normally like eating pork belly because it's very fatty, but I did it.  The flavor was perfect.  The choy sum stir fried with garlic was delicious, even my daughter enjoyed it.  I also ordered the prawns with eggs, knowing that I can't go wrong since my kid loves eggs. The prawns are giant looking... 

The wait staff was super friendly and the ambiance was worth the price I paid for.  We had to wait but it was worth it.  I asked the hostess if she can get a chair for my daughter, since she can't sit in the gaming area. 

I will definitely come back when we visit in the future.
So anyone who knows me know how much I LOVE cake. Birthday Cake to be precise. Nothing Bundt Cakes satisfies the birthday cake craving whenever it hits me. I like that they have "bundtinis" mini bunt cupcakes. And they have all different flavors and frostings. If you have never tired one, well then my friend, you are surely missing one of life's wee pleasures.
Anytime I am craving mandu aka Korean Dumplings, this is where I go. Their homemade dumplings are delicious and be prepared to be full as they are huge (there's a reason they call them King Dumplings). Nice thin dumpling skin with generous meat filling. I like to put a little of their homemade kimchi on the dumpling since it adds a slight sweet and spicy crunch to it. They also have kalguksu (aka knife cut noodles), and shabu shabu (hotpot). Usually when I come with my husband for lunch we order 1 mandu and 1 kulguksu and we are walking out stuffed.  I try to come early since the restaurant is usually pretty busy.
Very beautiful area with 8+ food trucks during the lunch rush and lots of benches to enjoy your food on! Surrounded by lovely gothic architecture to look at and tall trees providing shade....it can be a really serene place to relax. Of course sometimes there are events going on here and a random hardcore religious advocate shouting at the crowd.
I've done this hike a handful of times over the years.  It's a nice workout and the views over the Vegas Valley are awesome.

For a truly amazing view climb late in the afternoon so that it's dark when you arrive at the top. The view of the lights across the valley are stunning.
Absolutely the worst experience that I have had dealing with.....EVER!!! I walked in with an approval letter and they never called me back which they had promised by Mon. Wednesday came around and no call not to mention they sold the bike that I was interested in. Don't bother with this place if you are serious about buying anything. There is no such thing as customer service or honesty.
Oakmont Bakery has the bright clean pre-fab character-free atmosphere of a retirement community cafeteria or a dental clinic, only it's also much like the DMV in that you take a number and wait around forever with a crowd of annoying half-crazed people. On my one and only visit, I waited for over a half hour on a summer day (at least it was corporate-cool in there) to buy a loaf of bread. I went in seeking a sandwich, but the options were boring and few. The loaf of bread I bought was not holy, but holey. And this holiday season, we received a platter of assorted Oakmont Bakery cookies which were disgusting, even according to my cookie monster of a boyfriend. 

I don't understand the ecstatic praise. Maybe it's because I don't believe in god or preservatives (which have lowered people's standards).
just another 5 star review...yawn...stretch...order another shot. espresso a mano is one of few places in town where the baristas are capable of not fucking up soy milk in the steaming process. bonus, a heart AND a feather on the same head! i am tickled with love. plus, they carry a coconut chai tea, which is uniquely delicious, and some interesting chocolates. they're so cool, they don't even capitalize their name.
Bit of an odd process to ordering but worth it for the momos. 

Ordered 10 beef steamed, 10 beef fried, and 10 veg steamed (suggested by the owner). We also ordered one paratha. Wanted the potato balls but they were out. 

Everything was delicious. We liked the steamed more than fried. I particularly enjoyed the flavour of the veg. Watch out for the hot sauce. Totally delicious but as a fan of spice even I was reaching for water. Paratha was a miss - not much filling and seemed quite doughy. 

Everything came to $24 and worth every penny.
First time to this location, always love going to the Arcadia spot. Sat at the bar around noon. We like the cozy warm atmosphere and there are tvs at the bar to watch sports. We were greated promptly by Tracy, lovely bartender. Had the Bennett and bubbles that I have wanted to try, it was awesome, not too sweet, refreshing and perfect to pair with my beet and goat cheese salad. Great salad, the mandarin oranges complimented the bitter arugula perfectly. My boyfriend had the chicken sandwich with Mac and cheese. He enjoyed both and I tried the mac, it was yummie, pasta cooked just right and thick sauce. The manager was very nice, we chatted about the drinks and their new location in North Scottsdale. We will definitely be back to see Tracy for Saturday brunch. She is wonderful, genuine, fantastic service. She anticipated our possible needs and has a warm smile. Thank you!
Although I am not planning on purchasing a BMW anytime soon, I like to go here and just see what's new and just check out some very nice cars. The reason I like this place is because I know Mr. Zimbrick personally along with his son. They are a great family and REALLY know how to run a car dealership. Every time I come in just to look around, they don't treat you like some kid who is just in there to dink around... They treat you like a buyer and even if they know you aren't buying they still answer all your questions as though you were going to buy. The dealership is always spotless with a lot of little treats (water, muffins, and coffee) that you can have while "shopping." There are times when you will encounter a salesman who dislikes you coming in and just looking but that's how this goes! So anyways, if you are serious about purchasing a BMW or other exotic car (mercedes, porsche, jaguar) the Zimbrick dealerships are the place to go. Even if you don't live in Madison, surrounding areas come here for the type of customer service you would expect that comes along with an $80-90,000 car.
Great date place. Love the menu layout under a clipboard given at the table. The bread offered! Brioche muffins and pretzel bread with the room temp butter is oh so delicious. I love the charcuterie selection too.a few choices were: Duck prosciutto, Humbolt fog cheese, Jamón Serrano, and came with quince spread and fig jam.
Holy moly. I wish that was all I had to say. This place is flipping amazing. I got thr basic gyro and the Greek fries. So phenomenal. They came out at lightening speed, you get a huge portion for a decent price and the gyro meat is just delicious! Applause for Opa!!
This has got to be the best pizza we have ever eaten.  It's fabulous!  The crust is out of this world and toppings are wonderful. I recommend this place to everyone.
We went to Firefly last week for lunch. The service was excellent (their were only 2 other tables). All the food came out hot and fresh. Everything tasted great. I would recommend this place to my friends and family.
Delicious, fresh fish and great service. Definitely my new go to sushi spot!
4.5 stars , the town of Davidson is a very little unique picturesque place with tons of trees , Davidson College , restaurants and little shops lined on a center strip. I definitely suggest newcomers to the Charlotte area to visit here.. it has personality and class. A great day trip.
Not normally a 25% tipper but Brio got mine on 4\/20\/12! Great food, great service, and great experience as well. It was Friday night and the place was SLAMMED, 45 minute wait for a table. Wife and I decided to sit at the bar and try the house cocktails while we waited. Ended up staying at the bar where we enjoyed the company of the staff, full food service, and GREAT food! We shared the risotto and it was magnificent! Reminded me of the risotto I'd enjoyed in Northern Italy. Definitely recommend dining at Brio Tuscan Grille if you're on the Strip in Las Vegas!
Seems that a lot of negative reviews of the Clarendon come from never having experienced all that is the Clarendon. I've been there on several occasions and never had a bad time. This past weekend was the first time I stayed there, and it was complimentary thanks to the gift certificates I received when I attended their Snow Ball New Years Eve party at the beginning of this year.

First off, the decor should be enough to sweep you off your feet. The lobby is exquisite and I want that wall treatment in my next house. The rooms are well thought out and modern and stylish. When you first enter, the lights are on for you, and soothing instrumental music is playing from the alarm clock. That right there was enough to make me want to fall asleep. Then I made the mistake of laying on the bed. I have to revoke my claim that I have the worlds comfiest bed. This bed was so seductive that I went to bed at 10:30 that first Friday night. Yes you heard me. 10:30. Lights out for Tonia.

I enjoyed having Gallo Blanco right in the same building as well as the rooftop bar, which made for a great Saturday night. When I left Sunday morning, for some reason my 2nd night was charged to my account, but Matthew, who was working the front desk carefully went through and corrected the situation for me. He was awesome.

My only complaint about the Clarendon is that I'd love to see some cute glassware instead of the disposable cups in the rooms. Also, being that it's an old building, despite having four or five routers for guests, I was never able to get a wireless signal, and was told by the front desk they barely get one either. There should be some way to make that work.

With reasonably priced, modern, comfortable as hell rooms and a staff that will sweep you off your feet, I'll definitely be back.
Pretty authentic mexican. Love the corn truffle quesadilla. Great place, been there a dozen times or more.
Good service. Good portions. Liked the Wisconsin cheese curds. Beer was cold. Ribs were tender and the shrimp was good.
Well worth the money. My daughter started to struggle in math towards the end of eighth grade. I brought her to Mathnasium for one year and she has been getting A's in math ever since. She is in Honors Algebra II starting her sophomore year at Palo. She seems to be doing well on her own. If she starts to have any problems at all, I would not hesitate to send her back to Mathnasium. They did a great job tutoring my daughter.
Here is a short list of why Isshin is perfect; 

1) Amazing variety on their menu and 4 vegetarian ramen options 
2) Perfect service! The waitress is fast and very helpful. We were even thanked with big smiles by the entire kitchen as we walked out!
3) The noodles are heaven. Slightly chewy and absolutely delicious
4) The red miso broth is savoury with a hot kick too it
5) The seating is clean and cosy

You've gotta check this place out!
Went to this Hong Kong Garden Rest.
at 10:00 am. Had Dim Sum there and was very surprised how good the dim sum was. I am from San Francisco area, so I am comparing this restaurant to SF, prices are also VERY reasonable. Will definitely be back to this restaurant.
Go to place for Chinese BBQ meat! Our fave is the BBQ pork aka char siu. Also they have great rice combinations. There is some seating but mainly a take out place. Be prepared for a wait. Even when there's no long line up, it takes a bit to get your order because the lady who cuts your meat is very precise and takes some time. Worth the wait!
104 avis Yelp et 4* de moyenne. Je m'attendais à manger quelque chose de WOWWWWW! Mais non, c'était bien correct. J'ai pris le sandwich à la dinde avec extra carrées de Mac&Cheese frit. Le Mac&Cheese j'ai bien aimé malgré qu'il était froid. Le sandwich était so so...une chance qu'il y avait deux sauces, une épicé (un peu épicé) et l'autre sweet. Les sauces etaient un peu vinaigré. 

J'étais avec un collègue et quand nous sommes rentré, il n'y avait aucun client. Je trouve que niveau espace, ils ont mal pensé. Il y a un comptoir haut avec des chaises qui donne face au mur. Manger devant un mur, ce n'est pas ce qu'il y a de plus exitant dans la vie. Et devant le resto, il y a deux tables à Pic nic de 8 places. Le resto avait tellement de trophée et bref je ne sais pas si c'est parce que j'ai pris la dinde que je n'ai pas trouver cela si bon. Il manquait d'épices et de goût. Par contre, quand on finissait de manger un groupe de 10 gars sont arrivé et ce sont assi à côté de nous, j'ai pu voir les autres plats , dont les ribs et la poutine qui avait un air succulent. J'essaierai cela la prochaine fois.
Come for the margaritas- patio happy hour is a must do while in north Phoenix.  Located in city north near dessert ridge this trendy bar is better for drinks than food.

Many variations of margaritas to be found!!  I always go for anything with chambord.

I wish I could recall the food but all I remember is a huge basket of chips, I liked the salsa and I was buzzed after 1 drink and napping after 2.  Can't wait to return!!!
just your average gyro spot, does not really do much to separate then from the other gyro spots code by, but its good and fresh, i will be back, and you can score a bogo on citi deals or verizon local deals.
Called earlier in the day to confirm I could replace an auto battery under warranty. Auto area associate Rueben I spoke with assured me they had a replacement on hand. I didn't have a receipt but my original purchase a few years ago was verified. Someone told me the energizer product line was dropped because batteries were failing before being sold so the company switched to Duracell and have had no issues. I checked with consumer reports and these are rated above 80% out of 100. That's better than several competitors' products. 
I exchanged the battery without issue or cost to me. It was super fast and easy. 
Went with my family and tested samples. No issues there either.
I enjoy the Cevaps every time that I have come here with the fresh bread and sides of roasted pepper puree and creamy cheese. The side salad is awesome also .. everything combined is just perfect !
So leaving work the other night I was in the mood for some BBQ. A quick Yelp review showed this place was on my way home.

It's a small place in a business district. The young tatted girl working the counter was polite and helpful.

After perusing their menu I decided to order a full slab of beef ribs, a order of mac and cheese and two orders of coleslaw. With a tip it came to $53

I wanted to get a bottle of soda to go but they don't sell it by the bottle and I didn't want to spill it in my car on the way home. So I passed on the soda.

We found the entire meal to be okay. The ribs were very pink in the middle. I suppose some like it that way. But they were much more pink than we prefer.

Neither of us liked the mac and cheese. We found the macaronis to be way over cooked. We prefer them to have a little bit of firmness.

The cole slaw was the best part of the meal, although it was a bit dry. If there was a little slaw juice in with it it would be great!

So would I stop here again. Perhaps, but I think I'd try something different. 

And bottles or cans of soda would be great so you wouldn't have to stop somewhere else.
So amazing!! We were in awe from the moment the show started until the end!! People, props and fun in every direction!! There is no adjective to describe how fantastic this show is!!! It's a must if you are headed to Vegas!!
Teriyaki sauce and burger, is a bit too decadent for my taste.   Good flavors.  Just too rich for my palette.  Asian infusion for the foodie.   I'm a bit more good ol boy.   Good calamari.  But I wasn't a fan of the sauce.  Good service.  Decent atmosphere.   Should have a bar to sit at.
I don't know why this doesn't show up.  It's been open for over a year.  On second thought, maybe I DO know.

I picked Damon's for lunch.  It was slow.  I was busy fighting a proverbial fire in my office and waved my companions away politely, mouthing, "i'll meet you there" as I talked to a supplier about shipping valves to a troubled jobsite.  

When I arrived my friend James said, "they wouldn't seat us until you got here."  I looked at him quizzically, the other five people in our group were conversing, and I sat down to wait for our host to return.  A minute or two later, he walked over and seated us.

I looked around.  Damon's has room for maybe 300 - 400 people.  There were (we counted after we sat down) 27 people in the restaurant counting us.  The host was unwilling to seat the whole party until every member of the party had arrived.  How much sense does that make on a lazy Friday afternoon?  

We ordered and it took 45 minutes from the time we ordered to get our food served.  I told everyone it was probably because they weren't cooking it until everyone who was going to eat lunch in the restaurant had arrived with their respective parties, were seated and had also ordered.  

When Damon's (which i assume is a local franchise not a national one. . . but who knows) bought the building that used to be the Pittsburgh Chop House, I remember thinking skeptically, "really?  Damon's has gone out of business in two out of the two locations I know of in the Pittsburgh area over the past ten years.  They're looking for a new venue?  Cause the business model is such a cherry??"  But I visited twice. . . once within a few months of its opening (it wasn't a super visit) and this time, probably 9 months later, assuming the year of business would have taught them all the sorts of lessons only experience can.

They didn't learn.  Not from the businesses closing. . . and certainly not from the time they opened until now.

Dead to us!
taco Tuesday or it just to much for lunch, best shrimp and fish taco anywhere near or far really. always friendly staff and clean cooking and salad bar. load up on the cilantro sauce and pile on pico, cabbage, tarter and all the good stuff. i put to much stuff and they will break so i double the tortillas most times. 3 and you are good n its but 2 get one on Tuesday. if shrimp n fish are your thing then what the hell are you waiting for??
Underrated cafe...

Sun City Cafe is located in the retirement community of Sun City along Del Webb Blvd in Summerlin.

Las Vegas has an interesting array of cafés, ranging from the outlandish to the plain old dumpster dive that you would see on Tv getting closed down. Sun City Cafe is neither outlandish nor a a dump. This is your local cafe that mom and pop would come to.

The times that I have come here I've never had a single complaint. The service is always great, the staff have always been friendly and kind. Comparing to cafés cracked egg etc lines are usually non existent, except Maybe on Sunday afternoons, there are quite a few churches in Sun City.

The recommendations from here would be the French Toast, I found it to be quite tasty. General menu items have a variety of options on the menu from Burgers to vegetarian meals. I never did see a stand out or signature dish that screamed off the page but the menu has something for everyone. Decent service, with decent food.

Overall 
Price: $$
Food: 3-5
Drink: 3-5
Come back: yes
This restaurant is slowly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in town.  I came here for the first time taking a friend here for her birthday lunch and was pleasantly surprised (not by the beautiful interior) but how comfortable I felt in this beautiful interior.  

I felt at ease, the waitress was knowledgeable, not too intrusive and very welcoming.  My friend got the braised beef wrap with kale soup and I got the fish tacos.  Both came beautifully presented and delicious.

Since then I have been back twice more and have since gotten their flat bread, roasted artichoke hearts, mushroom stuffed with mushroom . . . anything I've had here, I have made a mental to order again next time!

Thoroughly enjoyable atmosphere and food.  5 Yelp stars up!
Outstanding work. My fedora was structurally sound but very, very dirty.  I thought it maybe could get clean enough so that a person with mediocre vision wouldn't notice the stains in artificial light. They got the hat completely clean, so that it actually looks new (even in sunlight). Took about two weeks or so, including time on its way to and fro. Not cheap, but an excellent price\/value ratio IMHO.
This is the best place for accessories ever.  It is also good for those with OCD as everything is color coded.
I truly feel that this theatre is a gem! Ticket prices are cheaper than Harkins and AMC and it's a really nice theatre. They just re-modeled the parking lot and the complex around there so it's really nice to visit. The theatre itself is clean, nice AC and doesn't have as many people as Harkins. I've never had a problem here and come here often to avoid the crazy crowds at Tempe Marketplace. Plus, I live across the street so it's very close. It's definitely worth checking out!
Stepping into Sel Gras in the middle of a cold windy montreal evening, you feel the low warm lighting wash over you as you slowly start to thaw. The waiter was quick to seat us at a lovely booth (thankfully it was a slow Monday night or I doubt the 2 booths are free often!) where we sunk into the welcoming leather. The ambience was really created by their fantastic music! 

The risotto was creamy and the arugula added and unexpected freshness to the dish. The serving size was really generous - perhaps since i ordered it without the duck confit. Glad they have a veggie item on the menu! The chicken was perfectly cooked and moist and tender according to my dining partner. Their plating is really appealing. 

We finished off the evening on a very high note with a delightful creme brulee that is a must if you come here.
Don't go!

No one cares. If you sit at the bar and order a beer, then fine. But don't bother to sit down and want a meal. They completely ignore you.  What a bunch of losers!!
With a name like America's Taco Shop, I had to check the place out.  

Got the "homemade" ceviche and the carne asada taco.  Thought the prices were a bit high for the quality and amount of food that I received.

The ceviche and tortilla chips that came with it were a bit bland.  The carne asada taco was good but not spectacular.

What got me though as I sat indoors in their dining room was I started to notice how dusty everything was.  There was a grimy layer of dust over all the decorations on the walls and the tops of the condiment bottles were frankly disgusting like they had not been wiped in ages.

So I decided to check out their bathroom.  Sure enough, the ladder they had leaning against the wall had a layer of dust on them . . . . 

and I felt a little grossed out . . . let's just say, if the public areas like the dining area and bathroom are not clean and well care for, I don't really want to imagine the condition in the kitchen . . .
Been to one, been to 'em all. Other than the city on the merchandise, they're all the same. This one is pretty small compared to most, but the outside seating area is great when its warm.  I feel like the menu has gotten pretty small though.. Maybe its just me? I don't know if I'm imagining things but it just seems like there aren't a lot of choices anymore. The food is decent, but I wish there were more entrée and salad options. Their salads are just boring! Grilled chicken Cobb, grilled chicken chopped, grilled chicken arugula and ceasar.. That's it! Anyway, just like any HRC, the atmosphere is cool and its a fun place, but I just wish there was more to be desired from the menu. That's just me.
Lot's of hype. Been their several times. I've been to some good French restaurants. Georges should be careful how they advertise their dishes, French? Food is delicious, the place is very nice. If you are looking for a PASTIS experience? Georges will disappoint and you'll be pissed off after you see the bill. Give it a try. I'll will give it a 3 star for being a trendy spot and for their outdoor seating. Great for your first dates. FREE VALET.
So awful - worst Dunkin, so slow, coffee grounds in iced coffee. 30 minute wait for 2 coffees? Come on...
This was my favorite AYCE sushi spot at one time. That was before the new owner started changing everything in here. The changes that really hurt this place is the staff and the menu.

There have been more changes since I was last there. Now there is a new sushi counter. I liked the previous counter better than the new one. The motor for the refrigeration unit seems to give off a lot of heat towards the end of the counter. Not to mention the counter was filthy where I sat down. Not only was the counter top filthy, but there was a bug in my daughters volcano roll. I handed the dish back to the guy behind the sushi bar and he set the plate down on the counter where they were preparing sushi.

I would also like to know why there are no Asian people working there anymore? This is an Asian restaurant, is it not? The other owner had Japanese sushi chefs. Now the new owner just hires anyone to roll up fish and rice. I'm not saying you have to be Japanese to make sushi, but come on man. Where is the authentic vibe that used to be here? It's just like a fast food place now. All they need is a drive through window.

Well, I can say after seven years of frequenting this establishment, I won't be back. I'm not feeling the new Sushi Mon. It use to be my favorite place. What a shame.
COMMISSIONS, COMMISSIONS,  COMMISSIONS....THE ONLY thing that PULSE FITNESS cares about. Zero customer service from Zach, the fitness director. They will do a hard, hard close on a contract that they have no intention of honoring, and will just avoid your phone calls and leave you Curt emails instead. Don't waste your time here there is no integrity at Pulse Fitness.
Parked here the other evening for the Goo Goo Dolls & Collective Souls concert across the way.  This place has quite the foot traffic, I assume the location is why (insert wink emoji please)!  
The parking garage, is well compact and far from the most genius layout. 
We perused the hotel, it's so, so. 
My friends and myself kept making sarcastic jokes about 'The D'.  Well, I'm here to tell you, I know what it must stand for ha!  I took a picture of the 'fountain statue' out of front.
Think about it...
I have finally experienced AJ BOMBERS!!!! And here is what I have to say... It is DELICIOUS. Now let's get a little past the bombs dropping peanuts, yes its funny and cool and all but really not what the place is all about. Their food is pretty freakin' good if ya ask me and the atmosphere is something to marvel at. Writing on the wall, industrial type decor, and some cool artwork in some places. I came here a couple of times to really get the sense of the place and here is my review in full (might seem a bit short but there is a reason for that). The happy hour prices are pretty awesome and the prices for food is pretty average. The people that work here though are awesome and really make you feel welcome. 

On the other hand, agreeing with what someone else said, there are better burgers for better prices out there and I feel they could have made certain items on the menu a bit more normal? I wonder if that sounds odd because I may just be nitpicking but it seems like some things on the menu are cool and interesting like their PB&J burger but others seem OVER done to try to make them something out of the ordinary. I would have given this place 5 stars but I can't get over the overdone-ness of some items and when it WASNT happy our the drink prices were too expensive. All-in-all, its not a bad place to experience ever once in a while and I do have to say some food items are spectacular, the staff is outta-this-world, and its in a nice location.
I took a chance as the review were all really good.  I had gone to this salon when it first opened by the previous owners.  I loved it then and now I am back to being a fan.  I had tried a couple of other placed in the meantime but thought I would check out and see how it is now.  I was looking for somewhere new to get my eyebrows done.  I generally don't like to have them done at a nail salon but saw they now have an esthetician available.  

I called made an appointment and when I walked in Nicole was ready and waiting. She took the time to ask me what I wanted to have done as well as what I did not want to have done.  She was great!!!!  She really listened and did a fabulous job.  It was worth the 3 - 4 month wait I had given myself to grow my brows back out to fix what the last place I went to did.

Thanks Nicole!  Looking forward to coming back in a few weeks for a touch up and hopefully a facial!!!  I will also be booking some "me" time for a much needed pedi and mani!!!!
As others have noted, this lifestyle center (outdoor mall) has a very strong focus on restaurants, with Macy's, Saks, local mostly home accessory shops at the Union, and a handful of mid to high-end local and chain stores which seem to inconsistently close early.

Note that the department stores have "shop in shop" leased departments for even more shopping choices (Sunglass Hut\/Finish Line\/Starbucks inside Macy's, Fendi\/Louis Vuitton\/Chanel\/Gucci inside Saks).

It's definitely an easy afternoon experience, and not as time consuming as the mammoth Scottsdale Fashion Square and surrounding Old Town Scottsdale area can be.  Shop at your choice of department store (Macy's for me), grab a bite to eat (Paradise and Zin Burger are my go-tos), shop the smaller stores, and refresh with a cold treat (Frost, Haagen-Dazs) or coffee (Starbucks is inside Macy's first floor Men's department, or there's local Royal).

They're finally replacing the temporary rug store in the Borders building with an Arhaus furniture, which is a welcome addition!  Jonathan Adler kicked out the temporary women's clothing store squatting in the old Tommy Bahama building, so the Biltmore is coming along nicely!
Very, very good. We managed to get a last minute reservation through our hotel (the wonderful Hotel Nelligan!)- we had tried calling ourselves but you have to leave a message and they call you back. We never got a call back. Call early if you know you want to go here on your next visit to Montreal!

We started with the Foie Gras Poutine and I had the tart with foie gras and blood sausage. The poutine was good, your average poutine but the foie gras slices were large and plentiful! I didn't mind that the foie gras was in large somewhat gelatinous slices on top, but I could see how poutine traditionalists would be turned off by it. The tart was good as well and I couldn't believe the amount of foie gras and blood sausage for 28! Plus the tart itself was enormous! It was good, a bit soggy at the bottom, but good nonetheless. The foie gras, which I had a lot of, was good, but not the best I've ever had, which was somewhat disappointing after all the hype of this place. 

Everything was very rich and so with the big portions it was hard to finish - but no complaints about that! The service was very attentive (for the ladies - it seemed like only handsome hipster waiters worked there - nice!). The atmosphere is casual but upscale casual, it draws a very hipster\/cool crowd.
My husband and I made appointments for oil changes for both of our cars at Goodyear on Sunday. His appointment was at 1, and mine was at 2. I showed up with my car at 2PM and my husband was still waiting for them to finish up with his car. We sat together in the waiting area, and within 20 minutes my car was pulled around and my maintenance was done.

We asked when my husband's car would be ready and were told "in just a few minutes". We waited, and waited, and waited some more. No one could tell us what the delay was. Finally, at 2:45, after waiting an hour and 45 minutes, I pointedly asked what was taking so long. They couldn't tell us. Several customers had come and gone in the time it took us to wait for my husband's car.

At 2:55, after a nearly two hour wait, they FINALLY took my husband's car down and brought it around. When he inquired (again!) as to why it took so long they said they had issues with a latch on his battery (he'd asked them to check that, since there was a loose connector issue).  

They gave us $20 off his service for the extended wait, which we appreciated for the time we had to wait, but they should have communicated with us about what was taking so long. My husband had only asked them to check the battery latch because he thought it would be just a quick thing, had we known it would take so long, we would have told them not to bother with it.
You can't hit the snooze button on a Saturday if you want to avoid a lengthy wait. As long as we arrive early in the morning, I'm all about this place. The service is great, the coffee flows freely, and the food is on point. Because carbs run the world, I usually go with the spuds deluxe. One day, I hope to venture out and try something new. Cute patio when the weather is nice.
I've been a anthro member for decades.  Five stars overall, well perhaps a 4 1\/2 for the LV locations- no shoes!  Yes, one can go online and order and return in the store if need be. However, come on! Listen, I'm accustomed to the large sized Anthros.  LV is getting kicked to the curb, what about the terrain items?!  Yes, yes online I'm aware.  
Let me suggest you become an Anthropologie member, it's free provide a name, email and phone number. This way if you misplace a receipt, it's under the anthro id:)  
Now, when one always enters the scent of the burning candles is irresistible. Peruse over, and grab some candles and purchase those delightful scented candles!
Those Pilcro jeans with the frayed bottom or embellishments are out of stock in your size. Well, no worries! One of the lovely Anthropologists will see if your size is elsewhere or online and will ship them for free.  
Great selection of jeans, tops, skirts etc. & home furnishing & accessories are ever changing daily and weekly. So, hurry in!  Wait, is it late at night?! They have a great website;)
Mon dieu que j'ai été déçu. Je pensais manger LE meilleur hamburger de ma vie...mais non. Oui c'était bon, oui c'était cheap quand même mais il marquait un je ne sais quoi. J'aurai donné un 3* mais la serveuse était tellement désagréable. Une madame dans la cinquante-soixantaine qui travaille le samedi. Elle était bête mais plus que bête. Je crois que ça l'a offusqué que je lui demande s'ils avaient Interac...elle m'a montré sa machine ATM (tse ceux avec 5$ de frais...) Bref, ce que j'ai commandé a été servi quand même assez rapidement, mais j'ai l'impression que la boulette manquait d'épices et d'amour. Les frites cependabt étaient délicieuse. 

Il y avait moi et ma mère comme cliente et madame la serveuse parlait de sa vie au cuisinier. Ce n'est même pas elle qui est venu savoir si tout allait bien, c'est le cuisinier. Quand les plats sont arrivé elle nous les a presque lancé sur la table. De la grande classe... Je crois que la madame avaient ben hâte de finir son shift.... 

Bref, à éviter.
Update your darn hours. They close at 2pm, not 9. Was really looking forward to trying this place out.
Dined here last night for the first time.
Was absolutely delicious.
Husband had a bone in rib-eye cooked to perfection (Med Rare) 
Pasta in the cheese wheel looked amazing.
The only issue I had was the price of the water. $6.00 per bottle. Had I known the water coming to the table was going to cost, I would have opted for tap.

other than that, fantastic!
Love, love, love this place! Macaroni & Gravy. Canoli. Pizza. Sfogliatelle. Steve rocks!! It's like home.
We use to love coming here for lunch and bbt. Unfortunately our recent visit was terrible and mainly due to the food. We have ordered the popcorn chicken with rice on several occassions. However, they have reduced the meat portion by half which is less than the snack size. For the meal it is $12 and snack is $7, so we asked the server if there was an error or if we should have ordered the chicken and rice separately because it would be cheaper and larger. She had no comment. I ordered the chicken cutlet curry rice which looked better but it came out cold. The drinks were good, we ordered the white peach oolong and strawberry twist yogurt. We asked to speak to a manager, they asked us to call the head office. The kitchen manager eventually came out and tried to make the situation better but we ended up finding another place for lunch. We were quite disappointed and will not be coming back.
This is a definitely a hot spot at nights and on the weekend, but if you are like me I can I'm the middle of the day on a weekday! The security is nice and pleasant - I had to ask them a question. There are both steps and an elevator (if you have children or strollers). The area is well kept, I did not see any debris on the ground. Plus, they have valet parking - if you need it for the weekend!
I have been going to Baskin & Robins since I was a young child. They always had the best ice cream and ice cream cakes.

I love the chocolate peanut butter ice cream from Baskin & Robin's. That's usually the only flavor I eat there. I also usually grab an ice cream cake from here when I am in need of a birthday cake. They write whatever you want on the cake and you are out of there quickly.

The problem I have is this particular location is that the lady here is not very pleasant. I'm not sure if she is the owner, but I am thinking she may be. I'm sure an employee would not be able to be so unpleasant with the customers. Also, they are very cheap when it comes to the size of the scoops of ice cream on the cone. I tolerate it though because of that damn chocolate peanut butter ice cream..lol.

The customer service is very poor here. The one star is for the management not the ice cream.
Mettons les choses au clair du concept. À l'achat d'une boisson JUSTE UNE BOISSON, alcoolisé ou SANS ALCOOL et bien tu peux manger les plats pour la modique somme de 4.90$ chacun. 

Je croyais avant d'y aller que je devais consommer une boisson=un plat et tse vu que les plats ne sont pas immense et que j'aime bien l'alcool et la bouffe.....j'allais être ben pompette et que ca allait me coûter une fortune. Mais non, c'est belle et bien à l'achat d'une boisson TU MANGES TOUS LES PLATS QUE TU VEUX POUR 5$.

J'y ai été 2 fois déjà et les deux fois un samedi. Une fois à deux où nous avons attendu un gros 10-15 min et nous étions placé dans la table avec 2 inconnus, mais ne vous inquiétez pas, ils vous demandent si ça vous dérange de partager la table et les tables sont grandes :) et la deuxième fois à quatre où on a attendu une vingtaine de minutes. Pas pire pas pire comme temps. 

Parlons maintenant de bouffe et d'alcool : J'ai goûté le bris fondant, le tartare, les calmars, les linguinis et une salade ah oui et j'ai volé une bouché de poutine à une amie.  Mon préféré les linguinis!! Avec peux d'ingrédients ils ont pu faire quelque chose de délicieux . Le bris aussi était ben bon. Pour le reste ne vous attendez pas à de la grande gastronomie, tse un tartare à 5$. Il est passable et frais ce qui est important. Ne chialez pas si vous savez que votre plat vous à coûté 5$. Bref, j'ai bien aimé le drink vedette soit le Costa Rica! mmm delicieux. Le mojito rose aussi et le Palomita à goûter absoluement si vous aimez la tequila. Un samedi quand j'ai été, il y avait un spécial sur la belle gueule 5 BIÈRES POUR 4.90$ OMG.

Pour ce qui est du service. Je l'avoue il est un peu lent. Un autre serveur ne ferait pas de tord. Par contre, les serveuses et les autres du staff sont très très attentionné et à l'écoute. Une belle gang...

DONC JE VOUS LE RECOMMANDE ASAP
Read a post gazette review and decided to try this little place for lunch.  I understand the owner is Kenyan and I'm by no means an expert, but I thought it was quite tasty.  Had the Tilapia came with rice and a side -- it was an insanely huge lunch for like $7.   I was just sad they were out of samosas when I got there.  

I really hope this place does well.  The lunch options around that part of downtown get boring FAST and this is a nice addition.
I had to call Dan out again.  Like I said in my review I will always go back to him.  He was in and out within 10 mins.  I will always go back to him with how honest and wonderful of a job he does.  Thanks Dan for everything!
Came here last week for winterlicious. My friend was craving for oysters and fortunately starfish had some open spots for lunch. I was late for 30 minutes so they serve her some oysters first.

Service was decent. They didn't try to get rid of us quick. When I came, I ordered more oysters. It was decent, but I've had better. It tasted a bit fishy, so I'm not sure about the freshness of the oysters. My usual favorite is the kumamoto oyster, but the ones they have here is not fresh at all. It lost all of its buttery taste.

I wasn't impressed by the winterlicious menu. The taste is so-so. Visually is alright, but it definitely didn't give a good impression of the restaurant compared to the photos on yelp. I don't think I will come back unless I'm craving for oysters and rodney is close.
I would have eaten everything on the menu over the next few weeks but I can't. One, I'm vegan and though I want to try it all, I shouldn't. Two, I don't live there, otherwise I might cheat on reason One. Amazing staff and menu. Prices are reasonable and they have Chartreuse VEP.
Absolutely awful. Huge fan of the original in Bisbee, but beside the menu this visit was a train wreck. After we were sat, a waitress took our drink order (water). Ten minutes later after I had asked for the water another women showed up with water. After another 15 minutes we again had to ask to place our order. Once we got our breakfast we never saw a server again. Our waitress spilled water on a guest behind us and didn't even try to clean it up, but instead yelled at a young bus girl to do it. Another spill in the waitress aisle had a busboy kicking the lemons, straws and napkins under the overflowing bus stand. He then tried mopping around all the items on the floor. We were done 15 minutes before we again had to ask for our check. The only person in the restaurant who was trying to make everything work was our young hostess. She was apologetic and sincere with her thoughts. Also, note to management, take down the Friday night specials board when it's Sunday morning,
Yay!  I love this place!!

The decor is not only stylish and unique, but pretty much useful. I love the ammo bins on wheels to sent condiments and napkins to the other members of your party. The rest of the interior design is great also. However, I do wonder if women had any input as the chairs have no backs and there are no purse hooks. Which means, my purse goes on the floor or the table. Either one is not appropriate. 

However, the food was amazing. And I'm German. I started off with the basics. A pretzel and cheese. Beer brat.  WITH ROOTBEER ONIONS. And beer. And strudel. And I didn't get hungry again until the next morning (and that was lunch). 

I really appreciated that the food was served on metal trays. It gave a little bit of extra flair. And I give extra points for the way management handled the patrons beside us that started off with a compliment and quickly turned to complaints.

The service was a little slow for being lunch on a weekday, and there were no purse hooks. So I'll be back, but will probably only bring my wallet in. Like a guy.
I'm not super big on the tapioca in bubble tea but I really enjoy the drinks here. I like mango poppers over the standard tapioca found in most bubble tea drinks and they have lots of fruity combo creations on their menu...so many it can be hard to choose!

Only been here twice but both times my blended drinks (the South Beach and the PM Mango Popper) were so yummy. Previously my husband wasn't a fan of bubble tea but after coming here and drinking almost all of my South Beach, he's all about it! 

Lots of modern lighting and seating available in this shop. Definitely a must-stop for me now whenever I shop at AZ Mills Mall. Great place to come for a cool refreshing drink. Wish they had a Fat Straw outside of the mall so it was more convenient to come to -- then again maybe that'd be too dangerous because I'd get them all the time!
It's always crowded, it is located at not-so-savory neighborhood (right next to stratosphere), and finding a parking spot could be challenging sometimes. But I'm very grateful that I get most of my medications for free here. Culinary Health Fund Rocks!!!!! The staffs are friendly and confident. I usually come in to drop off the prescription the day before so that I don't have to deal with long waiting time. If you absolutely have to wait, just drive to Luv-It Frozen Custard to get a cup of amazing ice cream & come back, or get married to some strangers at nearby chapel.
I had always assumed this was a Greek restaurant and never went inside.  To my surprise, it's a Paradise Bakery style sandwich, soup, and salad place!

My honey bacon club ($8.79 with the soup) was okay, but I can't even recall tasting any bacon now that I think about it.  It was VERY dry due to their choice of bread.  It was better when dipped in my bisque.  Unimpressive though.

The lobster bisque had very good flavor for being so cheap, but the array of veggies included (for texture?) was inauthentic and not needed.  They were a distraction from the lobster flavor, and the tomato, carrot, celery, and onion only added unnecessary bulk.  Don't expect it to be super creamy, as it was more watery than a true bisque (it's made with 2% milk instead of cream I bet).

The caramel creme brûlée ($2.99) was fantastic with a crack of sea salt from the salt shaker.  It doesn't have the crunchy brûlée part though, so it's more of a caramel-topped vanilla bean custard.  But creme caramel would be confused with a flan...

The complimentary bread and chocolate-dipped strawberry were nice touches, and in sure customers appreciate the wifi, charging station, and flavored add-in syrups by the soda fountain.

The pricing was very comparable to Paradise, in that slightly-more-than-Subway $10-ish per person level for a sandwich with soup or salad.

Parking can be a nightmare due to the Last Chance shoppers raging in the lot.  However there always is parking if you're willing to walk across the asphalt expanse a little ways.
My best girl friend I met up around 5:30 on a Monday night and waited 35 minutes for a table.  The wait area is small and shaped like a horse-shoe which makes a long wait awkward.

Once we were seated we got a nice big booth, gotta love the friendly hellos from the employees.  Mary was our server which she was very sweet and fun.  We started with the white sangria (me) and my friend got the dirty monkey. Both were served in a pint glass which is a big drink for just over $6.  We enjoyed the drinks very much.  We also had the toasted ravioli as an appetizer which was nice and crisp and hot.  For our mains she got the pesto veggie sandwich and I got the o-livo pizza which is basically Mediterranean flavors.  Her sandwich was huge and difficult to manage though a great value.  My pizza was thin crust and honestly a little bland.  Would have enjoyed more kalamata olives maybe? The crust was supposedly a little thicker than the typical but I found it to be blah and definitely not homemade.  

Of course the best part is the pizza cookie!! We got half chocolate chip and half peanut butter which was amazing. This was my friends first time trying pizookie and of course she loved it.

Pros: drinks, dessert
Cons: long wait, average pizza
Cool growler shop with a wide selection. Why the 3-star review? The service was weird and not very patient. They seemed annoyed that we took our time tasting and asking questions. I'll probably just keep going to local breweries for growler fills.
This place has such great potential. The drink menu is pretty decent and they have some creative pizzas. I always end up getting the mushroom party, which is exactly as awesome as it sounds. The dessert is to die for too. Give me a red velvet cupcake and I will swoon.

Three things keep me from coming back here more often:
1) It's rather small and cramped
2) The service has been slow every time I've been there
3) Parking is practically nonexistent
Disappointed this trip since I like this place since it is near my home. However, something always happens that makes me not leave a better review. This latest time, we ordered a cheese crisp to start, then our entrées. Well, our entrées showed up but the cheese crisp never did. Come to find out the server didn't enter the cheese crisp into the computer.  Apparently our waiter was trying to impress us by memorizing our order. Verdict? Not impressed. But then he returned and asked us when we were eating our entrées if we still want the cheese crisp? Why the heck would I want a cheese crisp for an appetizer when you already served me my entrée?  The food was not as delicious as usual. The beans and rice seemed undercooked.  I like to hydrate while I eat and noticed my drinks were not filled nearly enough.
Okay, so from what I am reading, a lot of other people got sort of "conned" into this hotel and I am no exception. We booked a trip through gate1travel.com and when you are booking they give you the options for hotels. The default booking is for Circus Circus, NOT Circus, Circus Manor Motor Lodge. It says three stars and even says this on gate1's travel site: "The rooms are fitted with contemporary decor and furnishings. All rooms are equipped with amenities that will be sure to make your stay pleasant, such as internet access (surcharge), a hair dryer, and a television with cable channels."
We looked up Circus Circus, saw it was nothing special, but alright and went for it...and found out that in fact, we were in the Manor Motor Lodge.
Now, I KNOW that this is gate1's fault and I'll be taking it up with them as well. Also, I want to point out that on my second night, I complained and they put us in a suite for the night, so this is nothing against the overall hotel, but there are still a few things people need to know staying here.
Rooms: They are DUMPS in the manor motor lodge. I asked, when we were checking in, if those rooms had been redone at all and was told that "all the rooms have been updated in SOME way"...well I don't know what way this room had been updated. The carpets were worn and stained. The bedding was the polyester crap from the 80s. The wallpaper was stained and peeling off the walls. The bathroom floor had cracks in the tile and a permanent grunge that could never been cleaned. It looked like a motel room you see in horror movies!
The hallways were constantly loud and smelled of marijuana, with cheap, apple air freshener over top, which was interesting because of the number of small children running around with distinctly trashy families. I even made a joke with a cab driver in Las Vegas, that we were NOT ugly enough to be staying in this hotel. He agreed and said it was the butt of the joke of cabbies on the strip. Good to know.

Hotel: The hotel amenities are geared towards children, but are basically a money grab. There is a small, indoor amusement park that costs something like $8\/30 second ride. There are shops and restaurants, but non are high end. We ate at three places while there and overall they were crappy. I'll give those individual ratings though.

Service: This was very good actually. I had a very pleasant bell hop help us out and all the wait staff and cleaning staff were very nice and the woman whom I complained to was very receptive and polite, so that earns them an extra star.

The thing with the hotel is that even these rooms we were stuck in, fall under 3 stars, even though they, by themselves, would barely qualify as 1 star rooms, because the whole hotel falls under one heading.

SO, lesson to be learned, these rooms are NOT nice rooms. The hotel is considerably crappier than other hotels. It's also quite far from the main strip. BUT it is cheap. If you are (for whatever God-awful reason) bringing children to Vegas, I guess this would fit the bill. Otherwise, if you're just looking for a bed and a cheap one, this also fits the bill. The beds, I will say, had clean sheets and were comfortable. But don't be fooled into thinking you're getting this amazing deal on a three star hotel. You're not. You're getting an average deal, on 1 star accommodations.
Local greasy spoon with friendly service and good prices. Nothing super special but a solid choice over IHOP or Denny's.
Great hotel to stay.  I was here for business trip in September, 2014 -  second week.  Every thing was good, very nice staff.  great complementary break fast and evening snacks.  Free shuttle service!! I really enjoyed my stay and i would recommend to everyone.
This review is for Yesenia. We had an issue with the AC unit in Az in summer. She got us taken care of right away and was awesome. I will update about the stay but CUSTOMER SERVICE is outstanding.
I was in the mood for some pizza before going to a game at the T-Mobile arena close by. This place was really hidden and I guess you can say truly a secret. 

After going down the hallway with tons of records, you'll see the counter and place your order. This place isn't that big, probably like 4 chairs and limited counter space. Luckily when we got there it was only us and we were able to grab a couple seats. I got super crowded after we ordered so something must be good. I just went with a couple sausage slices. The pizza was good. New York style pizza is my favorite and this spot rivals other pizza spots I've been to. I also had a bite of someone's white pizza... delicious! That's what I'll be getting next time I go.

Remember you're in Vegas so don't expect a bargain when coming here. This is the strip so it is what it is. Still a good option to grab a couple slices and be on your way.
My favorite Japanese restaurant in Toronto so far. Reservation is highly recommended. The food is different than other Izakayas in the city and restaurant is fairly quiet\/relaxing. 

My friends and I shared these drinks: Yuzu & Shiso Mojito ($12); Oolong-Hi ($7); Plum Wine Negroni ($12). 
The mojito was the best - very refreshing. Oolong-Hi was ok, couldn't taste the tea or alcohol. The plum wine is a must if you love gin. 

*Agedashi Eggplant - $6
Eggplant was tender and flavorfull. Not greasy at all despite being deep fried! 

*Tai Carpaccio - $14
The paper-thin red snapper was translucent, smooth and light. The tangy yuzu dressing brought out the freshness of the red snapper. 

*Sashimi Mori - $19
happy to tell you though that the fish + wasabi were fresh. Fish had a melted-in-your-mouth texture. 

*Anchovy Potato Salad & Chips - $6.5
Didn't like it. The anchovy was undetectable and salad was quite bland. But it went well with the chips. I also appreciate that the salad was smooth yet still had nice chunks of potato in it for some texture.

*Grilled Sting Ray Fin - $5.2
The stingray itself had an odd texture: a little chew and tough - but similar to the packaged dried squid in Asian grocery store. The fin was sweet and had a slight fish taste, and the char from the grill gave it a smoky flavor that seemed to just enhance the taste of the stingray. 

*Monkfish Liver Pate - $8.5
pate was rich and creamy, but yet at the same time very light and delicate. Love. 

*Ika Maruyaki - $9
The squid was tender inside yet still remained to be chewy on the outside. Seasoned perfectly and served with a dollop of yummy mayonnaise infused with a kick from the garlic.
The food and service was fantastic! 

When you first walk in you will be given a rose (female only). We were seated in a booth, a really cozy and romantic setting. We first started out with the jumbo crab cakes. They tasted awesome. The outside was nicely brown and crunchy and the inside was full of crabs. 

We also had the Hugo's table-side salad. My husband and I both agreed that this must of been one of the best salad we had ever eaten. We had honey-walnut vinaigrette on our salads.

I ordered a beef wellington and the husband ordered a Filet de Boeuf Atlantis. They were both delicious. 

For dessert we ordered a chocolate mousse. What can go wrong with a chocolate dessert? After all it's a dessert and chocolate. =) 

Overall, we were very happy with the service and food.
Mediocre food and service at best. Although the building itself is grandiose and looks like a palace with an interior courtyard, lots of artwork and such, the food and service weren't great.

To begin, I wasn't impressed with our server. He forgot a few requests and when I asked if I could try another side sauce for my enchilada he failed to mention the extra 50 cent charge. That's a major pet peeve of mine- failing to mention you're going to up charge someone for something is a big no no. When I told him, he offered to take it off, which I declined because that's not the point. You need to let people know in advance if you're going to do that. 

The food also just wasn't great. This was the most bland guacamole I think I've ever had in my life. The three table salsas and chips were ok. Not one of my three different kinds of enchiladas were flavorful and they all seemed to be smothered in cheese. The kids meal beef taco was extremely greasy. 

Overall wasn't a fan and don't need to return.
Gyro and hummus were delicious! Husband had the grape leaves and loved them. Great prices!
We needed to have a suit jacket tailored for our wedding.  My husband MD took his jacket in to see Dennis and was so pleased with the outcome.  You would never have known that the sleeve was altered and not the original length.  Dennis also did a simple monogram on the cuffs of the French cuff shirt that MD was wearing and it looked amazing.  If you need a tailor this is the shop to visit.  They do great work and are amazing people!!!
The best thing about Bellagio is still its location. It is centrally located on the strip. From there you can get most anywhere on the strip fairly quickly. Of course the exterior and interior are nice as well. The building is well maintained. The staff are generally friendly and helpful. The nice lady checking me in was nice enough to print me a new Mlife card.

I do love how many elevators they have. You rarely have to wait at all. I know this seems trivial, but it is important to me. The rooms are nicely appointed. The bed was a little stiff for me though. The bathroom had a large stand alone shower. This is another one of those small things that are important to me.

There is a conveniently located shop adjacent to the elevators. This makes it very easy for you to pick up water and snacks on your way up. Also there are a couple of cafes just a short walk from the elevators. This makes it fairly easy to grab a coffee in the morning.

While this is not my favorite casino to stay at on the strip. It is one of the nicest and certainly worth consideration.
This dentist practice is seriously best I've ever been to. Everyone from the staff that work the desk, to the dental hygienists they are A+. Dr. Howie is awesome and seriously is a perfectionist. I had a cavity refilled today and it was the best experience. You usually don't associate cavities with great experiences but this certainly was. I did not feel a thing while he worked on my tooth. Also, when we were almost finished he wanted to make sure my bite sat perfectly with my teeth and continued to polish and finish my tooth until it was perfect. Thank you Seville Family Dentistry.
Giving this Starbucks 4 stars because of the customer service of the morning staff only. Been to this location at other times of the day and nothing compared to the morning staff. They are very friendly and do their best to great everyone with a smile. They actually take into account people are flying. I do agree with other reviews of the pastries. They suck and they are never that fresh but they also aren't the same pastries you find in the stand-alone Starbucks.
Nice addition to the Distillery district! Stumbled upon this place when we were out checking the lights festival. Nice place for you to hang out and get a coffee, tea or hot chocolate. They have a few flavours for hot chocolate - best part, you can get it in a dairy free option!

I had tried the peppermint hot chocolate with soy milk and it was nice and minty!

In looking at the menu, you could also grab a bite to eat or walk in their store to look at the different condiments they sell!
I meandered into Compound after the Phoenix Film Fest a couple days ago to meet up with some friends for a drink and some talking. My expectations were not what Compound Grill ended up being, but not really in a bad way, just in that different way. 

The stage first off.. is fantastic, and I love the tables around it - reminds me of music halls I haven't seen in ages. I really wanted to jump on the stage and sing, but someone else was doing that already.. and they were doing it all right! So very right! Great mix of songs from the Beatles to GaGa done by a woman. AMEN SISTA!!!!!

The rest of the place was laid out kinda odd in my opinion, including a set of couches to sit and eat at that were set up around a support post. Around a fire pit, I could see. Around a cute coffee table.. yes. Staring at a post in the ground that doesn't even have art on it or anything, no... and well, as you can probably guess, no one was sitting there that night either. In fact, they were sitting everywhere BUT that spot. 

The service was eh... didn't really seem to willing or wanting.

The menu looked okay, but nothing I was screaming over. We ended up having some chips and salsa that includes a tomatillo\/avacado salsa that I enjoyed :) I also really appreciate the organic hippie vibe that I didn't expect going in. Sexy hippy.. that's what I'm labeling this from now on.

This will probably be the spot I head to in between seeing film events,  because I do really love their music space and the Harkins nearby is where all the film events are, but other than that, it's really too far away and don't have quite enough to lure me back more often.
I have to admit, I was underwhelmed.

The atmosphere was cool, and the location was on point, and I'll even go as far as to say that the service was good. But the menu was so boring to me. Now, to be fair, I didn't pick this place and I was in the mood for DINNER, so maybe if I was more flexible with my meal requirements that night it would've been different. But all I know is that I wasn't impressed. 

They sell "specialty" French dip sandwiches, which I wasn't impressed with. The concept is cool sometimes (grilled cheese all the way!), but it just didn't do it for me. The selection wasn't appetizing to me, and I was really disappointed in the lack of other options. So, if I don't want a French dip sandwich, I'm basically out of luck. 

I don't know, maybe I'm being a diva here, but I didn't like it. That's all.
Was in town for travel and needed some vegan\/veggie options. They had everything I could ask for an it was super inexpensive. Will return next time I am in Madison.
The host Melissa is really nice and The waiter Tony is amazing. They have a chocolate Popsicle wrapped in a candy banana peel that you peel off and eat. 11\/10 would recommend.
The new dealership is great. Jimmy the Service Manager is class act. The whole staff is. I originally wrote a poor review for a mistake that was made when I first bought the car but since then, the service team has been A+ and the car has been my favorite I've owned. Highly recommend them to all. They just do the right thing for their customers. Josh Kirby is an all star.
My fiancé and I are working with Kaide and let me just say how pleased I am with how she handles herself and treats her clients! I also have met the owners and they are just the nicest people! The designs that Kaide has come up with and her attention to detail is wonderful! We are trying to keep our wedding simple and easy and we really want the invitations to represent that and Kaide is doing just that! This company truly cares and is so willing to work with you that it gives customer service a whole new meaning! Thank you guys for being so wonderful and talented! I can't wait to see the finished product and I will recommend Kaide and the whole team to anyone I know who needs invites & etc!

*The restaurant was spacious and spotless! I liked how they had a big sink at the front with sensors so you wouldn't have to use the washroom and dirtied the handles.

*there were bibs, paper towels and plastic gloves on the table.

*service was average, not the most attentive. 

*I would not come back to Captain's Boil on a regular basis as it's quite expensive. 

-Lobster ($29.95) and Shrimp ($12.95) in Captain's Boil sauce: 
The lobster was cut lengthwise, and both the shrimp and lobster were cooked perfectly. While I understand the concept of the restaurant was to use your hands, but at some point it was extremely difficult to eat the lobster without lobster crackers. Half way through eating we also realized that there was no where to put the trash\/empty shells. 

While the Captain's Boil sauce was supposed to be the combination of all three sauces, the garlic was overwhelming. I love garlic but this was way too much and the sauce was under-seasoned for our taste. I also thought the shrimps had much more sauce and flavor compared to the lobster, perhaps the shrimp was smaller hence the sauce was able to penetrate easier?

Half-way through I decided to order the Cajun Fries. I thought the fries were quite crispy and fluffy on the inside, but it felt very.. powdery? They could have better distributed the cajun seasoning by tossing the fries as it seemed they were just sprinkled on top.
First let me start by saying one of two dogs was pretty good. They are both great dogs, one just needed a little more work than the other. Bomber the Golden Retriever was just a "happy" dog with a lot of "energy" and Mickey, the German Shepard\/ Basenji, was nice until someone came over or you directed him to anything. They both had some basic training. We've had Bomber since he was a pup and recently adopted Mickey. Mickey had some fear issues with new people. We thought it was a territorial issue... And Bomber just wanted to jump up and say hi to EVERYONE. 
With Mickey nipping heals and 84 pounds of "happy energy" Bomber, we were looking for an alternative to using a gentle leader that worked but wasn't correcting the underlying behavioral issues. 
So all the research, reviews, and types of training considered we called Bob. And now our lives are better. The end.
Just kidding. We (my wife) was tentative at first of using the collar on our dogs. Bob had us touch them first to get a sense of what they boys would feel. After a discussion of how the program works we were out and walking. 
The first correction was less than exciting for Bomber and my wife. But quickly he started adjusting to her commands and walked easily beside her. Mickey was an old pro. He walked fine and only needed a few corrections. What?? Yeah I know! But, what happened once we were inside? The idea is that Mickey stays away from guests until he calms down. Bob was able to identify what we need to work on and what we should expects. Within two days Mickey no longer tries to heard or show aggression to visitors. 
We worked with Bob for four weeks. About half way through my wife said I can definitely see a difference in the boy. Enough said! Happy wife, happy life! In addition we have two dogs who know various commands such as sit and stay and come when called and have a lot more freedom rather than always being on the leash. 
I would recommend All American K9 to anyone whether you have a good dog you want to be great or a good dog with some issues you need help sorting out.  
We still continue to work with our boys nightly and they only continue to show improvement.
Thank you for working with us!

Great Place, Yummy desserts!

This was my first visit here at The Patio. They've only been open for business for 4 months and this place was packed! I don't think they take reservations but one from our party, who called ahead of time, was told that hopefully the crowd would slow down around our meeting slot of 9:30p... one would think, right? Nope! this place closed at 1:00a and guests kept coming.

Looked through the delicious list of dessert and drink items from their menu. Wanted to try everything as they all looked yummy! But I decided on having the Honey Toast which came with fresh fruits and one scoop of homemade ice cream. It was a block of toasted bread with the insides carved out and cut in small bite size cubes and topped with the scoop of ice-cream (I chose creamy espresso flavor). A small bottle of honey was in a separate container poured separately along with the fresh fruits placed on the side... eaten all together and the result was so yummy! it caught my taste buds off guard! 

The setting was nice and cozy with a small swing set in the waiting area of their lobby which was a nice touch but clearly they need to add more table seating in their dining area. There is no patio despite the business name. Had our group of 9-1\/2 (nine adults and one child) gotten any bigger we wouldn't have been able to sit together. Actually, we were kindly offered another small table next to our long table but our seating was on the high table that seated eight and the small table would've made two from our party left out... at the end it all worked out and we all had a great time. Great service, atmosphere and delicious desserts.

Review #0831
Putting a pin in this one for a return review.  They were busy when I got here.  The bar is long and narrow.  A few tables line the wall, but I found all of them full.  The bar too was full.  There was a five foot section of wall that had a shelf of sorts on it.  I stood by the shelf.  It was...awkward.  A couple girls who also wanted seating also stood by the shelf.  

We pretended not to notice that we were all standing at a shelf while we sipped our cocktails.  

I started with an Italian 75.  I love the French 75, so I figured...why not?  It's grappa, Prosecco, balsamic vinegar, and rosemary.  It was a good cocktail.  

I started a tab and for my next round got a Nardini Reserva from the grappa menu at the bartender's suggestion.  I don't drink a ton of grappa.  It was good.  Stiff in the way that grappa can be, but good.  

I ended up getting a seat at the end of the bar and found myself constantly sucking in my breath to make way for the bartenders serving the tables.  I seemed like I was..."in the way".  

I had dinner scheduled next door at Piccolo Forno, and got a bottle of wine to take with me before paying my tab.  If you buy the bottle there, they don't charge you the corking fee at PF.  That's a nice benefit.

Busy night, full house, weird seating, good drinks.  I'll try it again if only because it's an ultra convenient waiting area for Piccolo Forno, but also because I have a feeling my next experience will be better.
Groovy dude... A kitschy, franchise pizzeria that makes totally funkadelic (and awesome) pizzas with a great beer selection. We've been Mellow fans since living in Denver and we were psyched to see that there was a Mellow on Selwyn. The portabella mushroom appetizer is awesome and could totally be an entree. It's a large portabella mushroom cap baked with artichokes, feta and sundried tomatoes served on top of spring greens with a balsamic reduction. Our favorite pizza is the Maui Wowie pizza. This pizza is loaded with toppings. I highly recommend subbing the banana peppers for candied jalapenos. Those candied jalapenos up the spice level and compliment the pizza really well. The pizzas seem pricey but when you see what comes out you'll see it's money well spent. I love their crust. Perfect texture, slightly sweet taste... Brushed with butter and sprinkled with parm. Divine.

Helpful Tips:
- Parking is never a problem. If the top deck is full, head down to the garage.
- Service has always been good at this location.
- They can easily accommodate large groups. 
- They have TVs in the bar that are always tuned to sports. 
- If you frequent the Mellow, make sure you join the Beer Club. 
- This location offers GFree, vegan crusts
What a great little place.  I love that it's located in Millvale as opposed to another "hip" Pittsburgh neighborhood.  I stopped in one day about 20 minutes before they were scheduled to close and I didn't feel pressured to leave or hurry.  It's quite a bit to take in--beautifully decorated confections in two cases.  Between the fondant penguins (which I held back on) and the macaroons, there were important decisions to be made.  I got a dozen macaroons in various flavors.  Pistachio and salted caramel are spot on.  Soft yet crisp.  Light but dense.  Fresh.  This is definitely what a "treat" should be.

Jean Marc also gave me a chocolate truffle.  Oh boy.  It was good.  Dark chocolate.
We had these guys cater our wedding.  We ended up having 6 different flavors of cake.  All were delicious, although the carrot cake was especially exceptional.  The staff was friendly and prepared. 

All around a great experience.
Great fresh food alternative

Places like tropical smoothie were great, but becoming really redundant tasting food, we decided to give Krayving a go. 

Heading over to the other side of the 215 on Charleston we dropped into Krayving as a healthy alternative to the usual stuff we grab. With a nice indoor seating area I was a little unsure if we stepped into a college campus cafe or a bizarro Starbucks.

Each table had a Laptop attached to order your food. Being able to add subtract and make your own order was a nice surprise. Images on the iPad were also a sweet little touch that was unexpected. 

So seating ourselves and browsing through the menu I ordered the BBQ chicken salad with my son having the grilled cheese and sliced apples from the Kids Menu. The salads was pretty dam good!!! 

My order came out in what looked like a biodegradable plate with biodegradable fork. I don't think I've seen this anywhere except the container park downtown.

With the outside seating area still under construction I will say this place maybe a new local lunch spot I'll be coming back to. Fresh food, unique ordering and a friendly staff this place is highly recommend for anyone on this side of town.

FYI 

They do have high chairs and a kids menu (credit) the menu I would say is catered for 1 and up.
Some friends and I come here for happy hour on Friday's.  The beer is good - I always drink the Sunspot - but like everyone says the service can be slow.  The last time we were there it was somewhat busy at 4:30pm, but not enough to have to wait so long for a beer.  They do have the same pretzels as Four Peaks, which are delicious, but other than that I haven't tried any food.  

Our group went recently for Oktoberfest, and service was HORRIBLE.  They didn't seem prepared for the crowd and we had to wait around 20 minutes at the bar for a beer.  Also have been on a Friday night, and like someone else says, it clears out by 11pm.  But what do you expect?  It's Chandler.
I only ever do this place for take out when I'm in the area, or if I'm looking for something special like congee. If you have not had congee yet, do it. It's awesome rice porridge. (Don't do the thousand-year-old egg though, it is interesting, but not nearly as awesome.) 

I had my hopes high after hearing so many good things from long term Phoenicians in the valley that love, love, love this place. Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Or just kinda settled. 

And you know what, it's okay to settle some nights of the week. 

Not every night can be a mighty! flavor! explosion! If that was the case then Pei Wei and Panda Express would have gone out of business years ago. Fuck it. I'm giving an extra star out just for not being a tepid commercialized variation of salty brown sauce plus rice. In yo' face, Pan-Asian corporate "cuisine." 

The prices are right, the food is piping hot, and the menu is extensive. A perfectly adequate option for Chinese take-out.
We got estimates from three different pool fence companies but ultimately decided to go with this one. They weren't cheaper but oftentimes you get what you pay for and this is not something you want to skimp out on. Leonard provided great customer service and was speedy in getting us scheduled for both the estimate and installation. The workers who installed the fence did a great job. Plus rather than being contracted employees they are actually employed by the company. They really know and believe in the product and customer service experience. 

You can get a 10% discount for paying cash. We were also able to get a very small group discount for scheduling our installation at the same as another neighbor.   

I also recommend putting an alarm on the pool gate. It only costs $10-15 at any home store and having that extra alert system can give you more peace of mind and provide an extra step of safety. 

Our pool fence looks great and we actually like the way it makes our backyard look more than before because it separates our different spaces well. Plus now we can relax and enjoy our backyard more knowing our little one is safer in the backyard.
We used to go here when it was Famous Sams  and it was tolerable.  Then we made the BIG mistake of going here when it became Max.  The service was bad and the food was worse.  I will not be going back here.  Famous Sam's was like that uncle you could tolerate because you could always rely on him to make you laugh with a joke full of words you probably shouldn't  be hearing.  Max is like the uncle in the corner that smelled kinda like he crapped his pants and never remembered to put his teeth in.  Just look away and pretend it doesn't exist!!!
The wings really were good. Not mouth watering or anything fancy but they were cooked perfectly and cheap. The sauces were great and didn't interfere with the crispy wing skin. Lots of options and so far, none have disappointed me. Husband thought the garlic parm had too much garlic but I thought they were perfect- if garlic isn't your thing I'd pass. Best wings nearby!
It was a big deal for me to choose an orthodontist for my kids. We made the decision to go with Popat for a few reasons: convenience (we live not too far away) and Dr. Popat's training. Those things have been very helpful, but even more so is the community orientation of the practice and Dr. Popat's service approach. We feel incredibly well taken care of and very grateful for Dr. Popat!
Delivery: I just paid $27 for two tiny room-temperature pizzas. Can't believe it.  Feel completely cheated.

Not sure how they can get away with two locations.  Montreal has some GREAT places for pizza but the overall standard really needs to improve so places like this won't exist.
Stopped by for a late lunch today. Other reviews are spot on about the process. Service was a little slow, but they were all still quite nice. The place looks clean, and the food was good. Watch how others pack their bowl and do the same. To me, the restaurant felt like a "do it yourself" buffet-style version of Pei-Wei. I definitely liked the food.

Some reviews caution about spiciness, but even trying for med-hot my dish wasn't very spicy. You can ask for Sriracha once you get your bowl, though, so that got the heat I was after. 

My waitress offered me a to-go cup for my just-refilled soda right as I was about to leave, which I thought was a nice touch. I'll definitely be back
I absolutely loved to atmosphere here. Although we didn't go up to the rooftop bar which is apparently awesome. We ordered the truffle fries for an app & really enjoyed them. My sister ordered two cocktails & both tasted like cough syrup. That was the only part of the dinner that came up short. We ordered the shepherds pie & it reminded me of something my mom would make, which is def a good thing. Very comforting. Last but not least, we got the chocolate car bomb for dessert which was amazing. Overall we had a great experience & will be coming back soon to try the salmon!
My husband and I stayed here recently for 3 nights.  I liked the beauty of the resort, the understated sense of elegance and luxury.  The size is fantastic, not gigantic and overwhelming.  The suites are spacious, gorgeous with lots of high tech convenience.  So for the facility I would rate Encore 5 stars.
Unfortunately, the service I received while staying there truly left a sour taste in my mouth and I would not likely stay there again.  Why?
1.  At check-in, the woman working behind the counter neglected to inform us that we would be directly across from the XS lounge which starts blaring music from 10:30pm until 4am.  So even on the 19th floor, the music was disturbingly loud so that I couldn't sleep for the first 2 nights.  When I called down to the front desk to complain, they offered me ear plugs which I don't use.  If I had been informed about the noise from the XS lounge, I would have requested a room at the other side of the hotel.
2.  When we got to our room, we were relaxing on our bed and realized that the left side of the bed was completely saggy.  I called down to the front desk and instead of immediately telling me that they would switch my room or upgrade me, they said they would send housekeeping to change out the mattress.  WTH??  When housekeeping arrived, they said they could either put a board underneath the mattress or switch out the existing mattress for a new one. We chose to have a new mattress then had to leave our room for over 30 mins so that this could be done.  Major hassle.
3.  When we checked out, I spoke to the man working behind the counter and told him of the issues we had experienced during our stay.  I said that if the stay was perfect, I would not mind paying for the resort fee but as it was, I felt that it was a more than reasonable request to have the resort fee waived.  Esp. since I did not sign the agreement slip to pay for this fee during check-in.  The man would not agree to waive the resort fee and I asked to speak to the front desk manager.
4.  This is where my experience got even worse and left an even bigger bad taste in my mouth.  The front desk manager, Robert Cosko, did not agree to waive the resort fee.  Once again, I told him about the issues I had while staying at the Encore.  Without saying anything, he turned and went back to the back area of the front desk.  I waited at the front desk for 5~10 mins.  He came back and told me that there were no records that I had called about the mattress . . . like I was lying about this incident.  Which I didn't believe him anyway because I believe in a place like Wynn the would keep either phone or computer records of all conversations for liability concerns.  Then I had the sense that he was looking at me up and down, trying to gauge if I was a "valuable' guest ie~ big spender worth being nice to.  Obviously, he decided that I was not because once again, he stated that the resort fee could not be waived.  This really made me mad since as we all know, high rollers are comp for everything at a casino resort and different charges and fees are waived all the time.

Since I did not agree to this fee upon check-in and I did not use the services that emcompasses the resort fee, I am challenging this charge on my credit card.

I met Steve Wynn once when he came to my school to speak (U of Penn, Wharton) and I liked him and know that he is a hard working man.  And he has certainly accomplished a lot in his lifetime.  Unfortunately, while his staff is well trained, their interaction with me was not friendly and warm and did not make me feel like a pampered, welcome guest.

I believe in service and am willing to pay for it.  In this instance, I did not receive any worth writing about hence the 2 stars.
if you want your eyebrows on point this is the place u suggest u come to .. kaya is the one who bought threading to Cleveland
Met one of my girlfriends for brunch on a Wednesday. It wasn't busy at all but the service was lackluster. 

Whenever I go to a new spot, especially one with such great reviews, I'm eager to talk to the staff about their favorite dishes and drinks. When I approached them with my typical excitement and list of menu questions, they showed minimal interest and had dull responses. I even asked for recommendations and the cashier wasn't very enthusiastic about any of the items really. A Portuguese donut sounded interesting so I asked how they were and I was told they are, "just eh." Wow! I couldn't even believe it but I didn't order one because of it. 

As a coffee addict I was pretty excited about the cold brew flight - but disappointed with all three flavors. They just weren't for me :( I'm not one to complain but I asked if I could just have a hot coffee instead. What was nice was one of the waitstaff refunded me the difference in price, even though I didn't ask to be. Even still, he just sort of awkwardly walked up to my table, handed me cash, mumbled that it was for the difference in price, and walked away. Not sure if I just caught the restaurant on an odd day or something but my entire service experience was just really was strange. 

Both my friend's meal and my own tasted just okay. Nothing special about it. Pretty bummed because I was excited to find a new, cool brunch spot. On to the next one!
Never have I been to this Thai place in Charlotte. We went on a Friday night around 7:30 and it was packed but we did not have to wait too long for a table. We had a party of 4. We started out with some appetizers, Spring rolls, Beef Sate, and a order of Thai Chicken wings. The Spring rolls were excellent - two to an order. The Sate was beef and such a great grilled flavor. The Thai Chicken wings were crispy but could have had more of a Thai flavor, served with a sweet and sour sauce. Our entrees, which we shared were the Thai Fried Rice with Chicken, a order of Pud Thai, which we call Pad Thai? And a order of Pud ma Maung, which was vegetables and cashews and we had Pork added as our protein. All the dishes were very good. Although I never found a Cashew in the Pud ma Maung. The Fried Rice was especially good, just a perfect Thai flavor. We ordered everything with a heat level of #4 and it was not overly hot.   They staff was very nice and very attentive for a very busy little restaurant! I will be coming back !!
As you can see, the last review was written in 2007 so this store has been around a long time!  Count 7 years and going strong!  It's an Arcadia regular. The selection they carry are upscale and most importantly, many are one of a kind for that friend or family member who has everything. 
I love to go into the store and browse and be serviced by the incredible ladies who work there. Just go in, tell them your needs and within 10 minutes they will have your outfit, shoes, and accessories picked out for you. They are that good and that quick. 
The clothes they carry are for all body types so you just need to browse a little for something for you to fall in love with. 
The best part of the store is the sign that says, your husband called and he says you can buy whatever you want!  
When you get home, laden with multiple bags full of beauty and glamour, just tell your husband you were just following his directions. ;)
But really, he couldn't get upset at you regardless cause when you put on the outfits you bought for him to see, he'll be so bedazzled by your beauty that the only thing he will be able to think about is which magnificent restaurant to take you out to dinner!!!
Love their Japanese cheesecakes. I have had their original, Angel Hat, and no bake cheese in all flavours (Sakura, Yuzu, and Matcha). We love all of them. Not too sweet and reasonably priced. Our favourites are the Angel Hat which is 4 inch cake at $10 which is nice and fluffy along with the Sakura no bake cheesebake which is $28. It is so pretty and very delicious.
Their biggest strength: The tea and hot chocolate we got was boiling hot and stayed hot for almost an hour!  Really great for those who like their drink piping hot, but it made things a little difficult to sip without burning your mouth.

The Mud slide cookie was like a walnut brownie on the slightly dry (not fudge-like, but not crumbly either) side, but had a good flavor.

The fancy manchego cheese Danish was delicious, with a chewy pillowy texture.

There's not a lot of places to sit down that aren't part of a bar, sadly.
My work buddies and I decided to go here on a lark for lunch today since we were craving something outside of the traditional Americana fare, and it was everything I thought it would be (but not more, hence the average number of stars). There were no belly dancers or tarot card readers, both dinner time lures advertised upon entering, since the noon-to-one crowd is generally geared toward the white collar crowd. That eliminated the possibility of a razzle dazzle performance that may have lured another star out of me, leaving the service, ambiance and food to shine on their own.

The service was adequate. Not really much to say either way on that. I did kind of like the fact that the wait staff was all eating there in a family setting and were just finishing up when I arrived. That immediately raised my expectations, since they wouldn't settle for anything nasty. Also, the kitchen was filled with....Turks! Not a single word of Spanish, which is quite an anomaly in the food service business. Again, my expectations raised.

Upon entering, the customer is given the option of sitting at regular or low seating. I highly recommend the latter, as it consists of plush pillows and short stools arranged around round tables. The main dining area is very open air with warm colors and sparse decorations, but it feels more sterile than the environment created in the adjacent rooms. Within these rooms comfortable open booths and pillows, upholstered in dark, rich colors are accented by decorative lighting that could have been bought from a bazaar and transported straight here. The layout of these side rooms adds to the ambiance and present plenty of opportunity for conversation. 

We all ordered lunch specials, which are composed of rice, pita bread, cabbage slaw and a meat of some sort. The lamb that I ordered was a little on the bland side and stringy. It would have done much better stewed than grilled. I would also highly recommend you trade the plain ole white rice for the biriani rice, which is saffron (turmeric?) based with veggie bits and walnuts. It was savory and scrumptious, the exact opposite of the cabbage slaw, which was an odd combination of vinegar, mint and garlic. It was a little pricey for a lunch special, ringing in at $10.95 without beverages, and the dinner specials are even more expensive.

I would come here a second time for the atmosphere, and maybe for the belly dancing, but I would definitely try something else off the menu.
I've loved everything I've tried here. I hate breakfast potatoes but my pregnant appetite was craving them so i figured I'd try- they are incredible! Breakfast potatoes in Pittsburgh are usually sopping in grease, reheated, and lacking in flavor- these were the opposite! Freshly cooked heirloom potatoes served crisp and dry (no grease at all!). I've had the funky monkey, sausage and gravy, and breakfast magic. Sausage and gravy were my favorite but the other two were also delicious. People complain about the wait but if you use the No Wait app it cuts the time down significantly. Try the bourbon syrup! It's amazing! Love their teas too.
This place has a great ambience. They even have a DJ during busy weekend brunch hours. Extra bonus- strong, flavorful coffee! Although we didn't try it, they have an extensive, impressive Bloody Mary bar. Husband tried the house sangria and said it was the perfect blend of sweet and strong. 

In terms of food, so many delicious looking options. If you like seafood try their lump crab frittata or lump crab sweet potato hash -- both were excellent. We also split a 1\/2 order of apple pie pancakes and they were delicious. A 1\/2 order comes with two large pancakes and is plenty, especially if you just want a taste of sweet along with your full savory meal. 

If you're looking for a fun brunch environment this is your spot. Do expect a wait during the busy brunch hours.
J'ai été un jeudi 5à7. De plus, soir de match. Il n'y avait pas beaucoup de monde (et alors...) Mais au courant de la soirée ça c'est rempli. Il y avait un dj, alors de la bonne musique durant les pauses du match. Beaucoup de spéciaux sur les drinks. Ce bar est parfait pour manger des mix Indiens-Québecois...! Bref, j'ai bien aimé pour un 5à7 :)
Had a really cool experience here, Kim helped us out and was really nice with a cool personality they have very interesting and flavorful ice cream and I definitely recommend this place to anyone.
This was my first time into MOD- went in at the lunch rush. There were about 10 people in front of me in line but the line moved quickly. I really liked how friendly the employees were and how they explained everything. It's awesome you can add whatever toppings you want for the same price. I went with the Dillion James pizza but added chicken, mushrooms and green peppers. The menu is really inclusive with lots of options, even gluten free crust and dairy free cheese. For the pizza and drink, I paid a little over $10. I tried a sample of the blackberry lemonade and it was a little too sweet for me but I saw a lot of people drinking it. From waiting in line to ordering to receiving my pizza, I waited 15 min. Not bad at all! Pizza was a good size with 4 slices and tasted really good! I didn't finish everything but they conveniently have to go boxes by the drink station to take your leftovers home. Tables were being cleaned when I was there so it was very clean. 

I would definitely come back!
Bought the Groupon deal and now understand why they have the Groupon. The salad bar had empty plates and no one was refilling. The items on there were cold cut and pickles. Nothing looked appetizing, soup pot was placed on a table next to salad bar. We drank ice teas instead of the wine the coupon came with but was charged for two ice teas, service taxes, groupon fee?? After buying the coupon and paying for all the fees ($90) it should have gone the Fogo or Texas de Brazil. 

All the people that gave this place a low rating, well they're true.
Was here for a launch event of Whitley Neil Gin and I got to try a few tapas. There were a raw bar at the patio which feature oysters to tuna, and king crabs. 
Great atmosphere and delicious food! Bar stools were first come first serve and there were various barrels around the restaurant that served as cocktail tables. 

-Botifarra & Peppers: Slightly charred followed by a natural sweetness from the red bell peppers.

-Jamon Croquetas: had a crispy exterior, while the filling is smooth, creamy and super tasty. 

-Stracciatella & Boquerones: The cheese was fluffy with just the right amount of saltiness from the anchovies, paired with a light zesty sauce on top of a perfectly crispy crostini

-Shishito Peppers: wasn't really spicy as I expected it to be! The heat is still manageable and the pepper had a grassy and slightly sweet flavor to it.

-dulce de leche and jamon: The donut was absolutely fluffy, light and delicious! Not too sweet with a nice savory touch from the candied jamon.
Very anxious to try a  new Mediterranean place...this did not float my boat. It did have a darling interior...Wait staff was very nice...very  informative..but the food..was UNSEASONED! Ordered the Tzatziki dip and rustic Bread, also the Eggplant Caponeta with Bread, And the Grain salad. My Friend ordered the Infused Vodka Cilantro Drink.  I was so disappointed with the Bread served with both dips... The waiter was right..You could share them ...if you wanted to. The tzatziki dip was nothing more than Fage Yogurt...with a tiny bit of Cucumber Skin micro planned over it. No lemon, No garlic..nothing ..NO SALT... The Eggplant Caponata was squares of eggplant ..cold...not seasoned. Tasted like it was made a couple of days ago. The bread, which was pita bread tasted flat..not grilled or warmed up. The Salad was attractive looking, it was Quinoa, Barley, Frissee Lettuce with Raisins and a couple of orange slices and a half an avocado. Such an acidic dressing..no SALT and NO Pepper. I can't understand this...it was such a good idea but it just doesn't work here... Like I said...Good Service..informative waiter staff and cute interior...Food..Just Meh!
I'm at the airport 2 to 3 times a week. Mickey D' s is a great place to wait for arrivals. They understand if you're going to chill for awhile. Free WI Fi and free refills. When you get the call. 60 seconds to baggage claim.
I really want to write a 5 star review for this cool, funky, full of "love" downtown establishment but being the Yelper that I am, several factors prevent me from doing so. 
The first & foremost is the choice of music that the DJ played on the chosen Sunday afternoon when my son & I were there. 
It was a beautiful afternoon, perfect weather as Phoenix can be in January. Glorious, in fact.  My son (who is 8) and I had just finished volunteering at a nearby community garden, was starving and walked over here around 1pm to have lunch. 
There was loud music playing, the patio was filled with diners, everything was picture perfect. 
Then I asked my son if he wanted to sit outside or inside. He chose inside which was odd since the weather was so nice out. So we sat inside for a bit then I convinced him to go outside which he begrudgingly did. He kept fidgeting on the bench- finally I asked him what was wrong and he blurts out- "Mom, are you listening to the words to the music???  It's sh*t this, *uck that and I'm going to kill this person or that person." 
My mouth immediately formed an "o" because I had not been listening to the words as I had processed the music into background noise. 
Of course we moved back inside right away where the choice of music was much more suitable for all ages & genders. 
Pretty poor choice by the DJ I would say and pretty poor selection by the management for picking aforementioned DJ!
The other issue I had was I had ordered the crepe w pulled pork shoulders. When the dish came, the pork was not pulled but sliced. It was also very dry- served without any sort of sauce. And the red cabbage\/ cilantro salad so beautifully described on the menu was just some chopped up red cabbage. 
The server was very nice and brought me extra salsa & extra lime\/cilantro dressing to make the dish taste less dry. It was still a disappointment. 
My son was also disappointed with his cheese\/chicken quesadilla saying there was not enough cheese (truth- it was very skimpy) and some slices had cheese and chicken while others barely had any fillings. It was uneven. 
I would come back here again. I do love the vibe and would give this place another chance!
I don't know how I ended up at this place. I blame in on serious hunger-starved delusions that the Caddy Ranch may have changed for the better since my last visit.  

The food is mediocre and kind of overpriced for the fare. If you're looking to Caddy it up on the cheap, check out the lunch specials on the weekend or the happy hour deals during the week. If you discount the tchotchke TGI-Chili-Bee's atmosphere, it can be a pretty decent happy hour or football destination if that's your bag.

The appetizer sampler is on par for bar food and a pretty good deal for the price. The sliders are disappointing in terms of size and flavor, but the fries they come with are pretty tasty. Onion rings are grease-heavy and came out cold. Whatevs. The food really isn't the issue I have with this place. It's probably a two stars for the food alone, "Meh. I've experienced better."

What pushes this into the dud pile: Crap wait staff that doesn't seem to give a flying rats ass about your table. Straight up grody cocktail combinations that left us feeling like we were about to go into a sugar coma. The seedy vibe at the nightclub coupled with a cover to get in. And the fact that the mechanical bull is like, never on. The night life is really a little slice of the West Side in Tempe. As a reformed G-town resident, I really need to keep away or risk slipping back into my trash person ways.

Nyet. Nyet. Nyet. Three strikes and you're out, Caddy.
I'm a fan of the Los Dos!!! A lot. A lot. A lot!!! 

If I have a friend in from out of town and they want a good representation of Mexican food and atmosphere here, this is where we head to. The building is just beautiful, and when you walk in to see the patio area, I don't know anyone that could not fall in love with it's complete randomness that somehow matches perfectly. The statue of liberty, the fountain, the old bicycle.. it's briliant!!

The food is also incredible. I crave the salsa constantly and the sopapillas are a force to be reckoned with. So far I've had the carnitas and the adovada and love it. I like that Los Dos isn't afraid of spice and doesn't wimp out for it's customers. It's authentic Mexican, take it or leave it.

I've had a good time here both with small and large groups though with a large group our orders got all confused as it was hard to hear the orders the server was shouting and they were just set down anywhere. However, it will not stop me from a return.
Had to take up temporary residence here after a flood disaster at our home. The two bedroom suite with a kitchen was perfect for my husband and I, two young children and Grandma (who was visiting from out of town). The rooms were clean and well kept, and the free breakfast was much better than your average run of the mill cereal bar. The pool and jacuzzi were relaxing and clean, and the lobby staff always greeted us with a bright smile. I would highly recommend this hotel.
Yes, everywhere there are pharmacies.  Yes, usually a wait of some kind and always when one is perhaps cranky?  Feeling under the weather?  Patience, please.  I don't usually have any, but at pharmacies I try:)  think of this, behind the pharmacy counter how do you think they feel.  People coming in who some have become walking incubuses! Ha!  Bravo for those employees at pharmacies exposing themselves with us patrons who some come in sneezing, hacking away and some may also have a temperature.   They assist and explain, guiding us for a healthier us. 
Today, Tanya escorted and maneuvered her way around the aisles and products explaining the products I inquired about.  She was on it! If only white rice was around and I could state: she was on it like white on rice bahahah. 
Yes, CVS has changed its interior once again.  That's why I needed her wonderful assistance and patience;)
Store is laid out nicely, well except this time of year.  Halloween candy abounds and is in my face.  Nope, no will power against chocolate;)
Clean store, friendly staff!
This was a waste.  Me & hubby had the shack burger and the spicy chicken sandwich and we split the fries.  The burger had an odd taste and odor to it and the chicken sandwich was reminiscent of school lunch.  The fries were old\/stale.  Save your money folks because based on these reviews it's hit or miss here; it's a gamble.  Your better off grilling burgers yourself at least then you know you got your money's worth and the food won't disappoint!
I can't rate The Pick Up artists highly enough. I had an incredibly positive experience with this company. 

I did some home remodeling & had a few closet shelves, poles, some floor carpeting, and a few random plastic, metal, etc. trash. 

I had to get this removed pretty soon as I needed to let my dog alone in the backyard for one night, and she eats just about anything.

I called and was offered a same-day pickup, but I decided to do it a few days after. It was nice to know I had the option, though. 

I was surprised to find out there was text message updating, which was refreshing because it's far more convenient than a phone call. They showed up in the allotted 1 hour period,  and I got the text about 10 minutes before they showed up.

The day of the pickup, I was greeted with two men. They were really kind & professional. The entire process took maybe 15 minutes, and they even swept up the random, small debris. 

The pricing was reasonable for such a professional, seamless process. If I ever need trash pickup again, I will be a repeat customer. Thank you so much!
Omg, having lunch here the other day was a comedy of errors.  I was in the area and since I've always loved the decor of AZ 88 I decided to stop in here for lunch.

My order was very simple.  I ordered the BLT on wheat bread, no mayo, with sliced hard boiled egg.

The order took an enormous amount of time to arrive.  No big deal, it was a beautiful day out.  The weather was perfect, I was sitting outside, there was a Native American festival going on with music so I just relaxed and enjoyed myself.

My lunch arrives on white bread with mayo.  The server deposits the sandwich on my table then leaves to wait on someone else.  I flag him down to let him know my order was wrong.

He takes the sandwich back- tick tock, tick tock, the mouse ran up the clock AND ran back down SEVERAL times.  I was starting to feel famished.

He brings the sandwich back- it is on wheat bread- but still with MAYO.  Omg, really???  He started to take the tray back and I was so famished, I told him to just take the sandwich and leave the fruit salad\/ salad and pickle (otherwise, I was going to have to gnaw on his hands!!!  I was soooo hungry!!!).

He obliged my request- 3rd time was the charm- got my sandwich as ordered.

The manager was nice- came by twice and apologized . . . although he did not give me a discount or comp me the lunch . . . hmmmm.
My sister and I decided to spend a long weekend in Montreal. We went with Priceline to get our hotel and were reasonably pleased with getting the Delta Centre-Ville as the hotel we ended up bidding on. It's a pretty good location and an okay price for a 3-1\/2 star hotel in Montreal (from what we were finding were normal prices). We paid around $125 a night, if I remember correctly. However, take into account that parking is around $25 extra per night, so really you're looking at $150\/night...so it's not cheap and I was expecting 3-1\/2 star quality. I did NOT get that.

The lobby looked pretty promising, clean and modern looking, but our room certainly doesn't look like any of those pictures you see on the travel sites. 

The furniture was old and worn. The curtains were also worn and one had a hole in it that looked like it had been burned with a cigarette. The bathroom was very dated. The mirror was all that fake, gold brass, with lightbulbs that got really hot and there was no fan! There was also a single hook in the whole bathroom to hang towels on. Not even a towel holder, just one hook. The wallpaper was old and peeling in places. 

The floor, where the door opened, was ripped and missing chunks. The bedding was old and dingy. There was TONNES of mold on the ceiling where the A\/C vent was. 

In retrospect, we should have complained, but it wasn't so bad we couldn't sleep there, so we made due. 

All this even would have been fine. I would have given it two, maybe even three stars (if I was feeling generous), except for what happened AFTER we checked out.

My sister had put the room on her credit card and she noticed a $100 charge from the hotel on her card when she got home. Since we had gone through Priceline, you pay in advance, so we had already paid for the room. She called up the hotel to ask about the strange charge. 

The girl she spoke with told her that this was a sort of "downpayment" that they charge when you check in and assuming you don't make any charges, they reimburse you. So far fine, right? Except this was not explained politely. The girl was very rude and curt in explaining. No one had mentioned this when we checked in and my sister said so. The girl then told my sister that, "If you ever travelled, then you would KNOW about this sort of thing, because EVERY hotel does it...Are you happy?" 

My sister was shocked by this response and just said yes and hung up. Then, regaining her bearings and realizing how rude the exchange had been, called back and asked to speak with a manager. She explained to the manager how she had been treated over the phone and the manager said she would speak to the girl. Obviously we have no idea if this happened, or how it was dealt with.

The fact is that 1) We actually travel quite a bit and NO actually Hotel Girl, other hotels do NOT charge you randomly, for no reason and 2) What if we didn't travel often?? How rude to throw it in our faces, as though this is something that any idiot should know, when it hadn't been explained. 

So you know what....I can take the crappy room and old, dingy decor...but I can't take the hotel staff being blatantly rude and obnoxious. I would not recommend this place.
This is one of the nicer Golds Gyms in the Vegas area. It is a little smaller than the Eastern & Serene gym. It has plenty of equipment and weights. They keep it clean. It is way to far from Summerlin Though. They need to open a Golds around the Charleston & I-215 area.
I must admit I love the decor of the Stingrays.  Both at the Biltmore and at the Scottsdale Quarter location.
While the one at the Biltmore was a bit too modern to be a comfortable place to dine for me, the one at Scottsdale Quarter has the right mix of modern and comfort and I really enjoyed dining there for lunch today.
Plus, I was there at 11am when they first opened and when I told the waitress I had 30mins to eat for lunch, they got me in and out within that time and the food was good.
But again, the waitress did not know her menu and did not bring me everything that was included with my lunch order.
Thumbs down and unfortunate for a place with such beautiful decor and quality of food.
I keep going back to VooDoo for the great views.  This time though my meal was also great.  Our server remembered us from a previous visit and was quite helpful.  The filet was excellent.  The wine selection is very good.

The one down side was the macaroni side.  It was less than impressive.  The mashed potato side made up for it though.
I want to preface this entire review with: it really should and could be at least a four, and it's a really nice place and I liked it! I was swithering between three and two stars, but I'm giving it credit for potential.

Guchhi really has the stuff to make itself a hero of Leith, and I regret this will read as a pretty negative review... because instead of one big flaw dragging it down, which I could mention in passing and scoot on by, there are lots of little things that will take longer to talk about, making this probably sound more like a two-star review. So, again, reiterating - it's a really nice place and I liked it.

However, it's looking a bit tired on the outside - the door frame is peeling and tattered, but once I got in, I felt myself smile, because it's really quite lovely. Big high ceilings, clever decoration, a very lovely swinging egg chair (I WANT ONE!), warm and toasty, and a general sense of elegance.

We came on a Groupon deal for four tapas and two cocktails at about £16 (I can't remember the exact amount) and were fully prepared for a lovely seafood feast. However, the waiter swiftly informed us that all fish was off. Shellfish, fine, but no fishywishy. It hadn't come in off the boat. Well, I mean, I thought that the good part of that was that the fish they serve is fresh, but the bad part is that the fish they serve they actually don't serve. The manner in which the news was delivered to us suggested that this is very much standard routine at lunchtimes: half the menu (at least) is out of bounds. O...kay... So I plumped for a clam starter, Sarah L had the mussels, and we both went for a chickeny thing for main.

A big plus point is that my fear with tapas is a lack of size, and with only four between us I thought I would leave very hungry (even though we added some rice and chapatti to our order), but that wasn't an issue here. I had a bit of a job digging around to find the clams inside the shells under all that sauce, but despite their playful game of hide-and-seek, they were plentiful and tasty. My first clam experience! The butter chicken I had for main was nice - I'm not sure I'd pay the price on the menu for it, but it was nice. More my kind of thing than the clams, in fact, since I'm a fan of all things chicken.

It's also worth noting that we had booked the deal for last week, but they rang up and asked us to change it due to some kitchen issue or other.

The deal included cocktails, but alas, there was a mocktail fail. I think what I was delivered was actually, basically, just mango juice. It was nice, sure, but the girl had vowed some kind of mocktaily thing.

Ah yes, the girl. There were two tables occupied - ours, and another table of two. It's quite a big place, so it's a shame that it was so empty on a Friday lunchtime in such a good location. I guess sometimes I'd be inclined to forgive cold and unsmiling service if a place were heaving with people, thinking "gosh, it must be so tough to deal with all of these people; I know I could never do this job well". But really, when there are four people in your restaurant, it's not hard to raise a bit of conversation or at least smile, rather than saying the bare minimum. This wasn't Voucher Treatment (I know some people say they're ill-treated because they come on a voucher) because she was like it from the off, before Sarah presented the voucher. So... she was just naturally mardy.

So, in summary: no fish dishes (in which they're supposed to specialise), unfriendly and somewhat dilatory service, lame attempt at some kind of non-alcoholic cocktail, BUT nice place, decent food, good portions. I do want to go back, perhaps in an evening, and try it again. Because, like I said, it's lovely - or it ought to be. It's got all the potential, and it clearly has been for other Yelpers in the past.
Came here during the halftime of the football game I was watching next door at All-American Pub and was surprised at how fast they took my order and served it to me. Real fast service even while they were busy.

I simply had tacos which were good. 

I ordered, ate, paid, and was able to get back to the game in time to watch the rest of the game so that worked out really well. Can't ask for more

Fast service, good food :)
My wife and I love this Chinese place. It's not to oily and the food is always delicious. The delivery is very fast as well. Great for a night you don't want to cook or go out!
Has made me a die-hard fan of Lebanese cuisine. Easily the best hummus I've had - and I've had a lot of hummus. Would recommend Zeitouni's to anyone. Definitely give the shish tawooq (chicken skewer) sandwich a try, and ask about the shish tawooq special (which is not on the menu) as well, and you won't regret it.
Mmmmmm....we always make a trip here when we're in Vegas, although now there is one in Scottsdale so that takes some of the excitement out of it.  

I'm usually in a group of 6 or more, and we've never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a table.  Service is good, which can be hit or miss when you're with a large group.  They start you off with warm bread, and will refill it if you ask.   I order the Pasta Telephono, it's amazing with toasted bread crumbs on top.  It's a big portion, so share or don't eat the whole day in preparation!  I've also had the Caprese Salad and the Greek Salad - two of my favorites.  

The atmosphere is nice and is a great start or finish to a night out....we are never disappointed and always look forward to the next visit!
came in to get a cell phone case for my new galaxy s7 and got way more than that. This place had great prices and amazing customer service, anyone that needs cases or repairs for a MORE than reasonable price should definetly make there way over here
I must admit, I'm a tiny bit embarrassed that I LOVE this place.  When a group of us girls get together, pull out the party dresses, and break out the spray tans this is where we go!  First off, the place is huge with a large patio, so there's always somewhere to walk around and grab a drink (unlike PCL and SIX....too small and you only have room to stand there awkwardly until you've had 3 or 10 drinks).  The band, Envy, is the best thing about the place.....the 2 good looking guys and the cute girl put a ton of energy into performing top 40 stuff.   

On top of that, the people watching......wow.  There's a big age range from 20's to 50's, and yes, the cougars are on the prowl and there are creepy guys a plenty.  That's part of the entertainment!  

I haven't eaten here, so the 5 stars is definitely for a Friday or Saturday night out.
Be careful here!  They'll give you a price list for a pedicure and then add on items that they don't tell you how much they are, and your pedicure will end up being more than double at check out! My two friends got a Deluxe Pedicure for $35.  They each wanted gel, which is usually $10 more at other locations, and rockstar sparkle. They expected like $45 at checkout. Mind you, no one ever told them how much these add-ons were. When they went to check out, their pedicure was $60! Jerks! Never going back!!!!
Very impressive view. Couldn't stay long outside since it was 100 degrees.  Only did the observation deck. Not my style to be jumping off any building or dangling on the side of them. Props to those people. And the fake green screen photos were too fake to purchase.
Nice place great selection of books and trinkets. They have a USPS which is rad, because the real ones always have super long lines and turtle slow service. These guys are nice and fast. They also have old nes games how cool is that. The location is a little tucked aways. They are in the same lot at the Stein-mart.
Wow super concept! Nourriture locale avec saveurs du monde. Presque tout vient des fermiers près du resto. Et le chef prépare cela avec des saveurs du monde comme par exemple de la nourriture avec une touche mexicaine, indienne, péruvienne, etc. Le staff est très sympathique et courtois.  J'ai eu la chance de parler avec la manager et elle m'a dit que le menu change souvent. J'adore et les plats ne sont pas trop cher. À conseiller absoluement si vous passet par la petite ville de Ormstown :)
Beer.....need I say more? Great variety of local and craft beer. The staff is great and fun to be around.
Shop for beer while drinking beer! Grab a beer from the bar and browse the diverse selection organized by style. All the beers are sold by the bottle (at a slight premium).
A custom juice never hurts!  Checked out the anticipated Gastro pub near the prepared food area- looking pretty inviting! Looking forward for the opening of it!
I had high hopes for Orlando's they had such postive reviews. I took my 2010 nissan Altima coupe in to get repaired. I got side swiped on the whole passenger side of my car. So since I had some money saved up. I thought they could repair the damages and do a custom paint job for my whole entire car. It would be a metallic with a pearl in it. They did a good job at taking it apart and doing the body work and putting on aftermarket grill. I picked up my car on a Saturday Jason was off and it was only nicolle. I went with my friend when we left he said you can see blotchy spots on the car. So I waited til Monday to talk to Jason. I brought my friend with me who told Jason you can do a metallic with a pearl. Then Jason said you could. But prior to that he Jason told me you couldnt. I asked him what he could do to fix it. He came back and told me it would be ridiculous to repaint my whole car. Jason even said he say it was blotchy in the paint booth. If he saw it why not fix it. I think they are just used to doing insurance work and not experienced in Doing custom paint jobs. Whats funny that what they say on there business cards custom paint jobs. So I left and took it to a custom painter. He said it wasn't bad. But you can see that it is blotchy. I was very disappointed. So the next day I called the owner shane Jason brother. Told him I wasnt satisfied with the paint job. He told   me he wasn't going to repaint my car. Then started to tell me that he has painted over 1500 cars.  He even told me Bugz custom painter who is one of the best. Wouldnt have done as good job as they did. I could tell you this I know bugz and he would of done alot better then these clowns. It wouldn't have been blotchy. My friend wanted to get work done by orlandos after seeing my car he was like nope. Now I'm going to have to have bugz repaint it. I regret taking it to them. I should of waited for bugz. I got impatient and wanted it to get done right away. Oh yeah when I got my car back the pockets behind my seats where hanging. they broke the clips. When I called to tell Jason he was like why would we do that. I was like idk. Probably in a hurry. Then they didnt hook up my module to my door. So I took it took audio shop to have them fix it. The audio shop  even told me my car is blotchy. I didnt tell him anything. That is pretty embarrassing. So if your getting your whole car painted or custom paint job I recommend you not going to orlandos.
Thank you to Megan (aka Elle Woods) and Rebecca- my favorite baristas that always make my day... And drinks!

Working in the mall, my team heavily relies on this Starbucks.  Often times we need more than 1 drink carrier or perhaps 2 people to go at once to ensure our order is safely carried back to home base.

I'm a fan of the chocolate marble bread and a hot nonfat latte... But the history of favorites could paint a mural.  Don't get me started on holiday drinks!  Also don't think about the sugar!
Can someone please explain to me why there is a line of 25 people deep at the breakfast buffet and only one (slow ass) person there to seat people. It's not like it was super early in the morning (like 4 AM), it was 8 AM - AKA prime breakfast time. There should have been 2 or 3 employees seating people. The amount of time we waited to be seated was longer than the amount of time we spent eating our breakfast (which was totally not worth the $18 charge). Not to mention it was a huge challenge to get a waitress to bring us water, orange juice, or anything else we may have needed. This experience just reaffirmed why I hate buffets.
Heads up! This place is currently on ""Winter Hours" which are 10 AM - 5PM. Yelp is wrong about the hours that they are open. Because they were closed when I got there at 5:30 PM today I could not try the bowls or smoothies. Will report back once I've done that.
After driving around the strip mall, I finally found this cute little coffee shop and settled in to do some work.  Thanks to Eugene T., I knew I would be interested in the Red Eye to get over my mid afternoon slump.  

There are a lot of knickknacks here.....which created a homely, coffee shop atmosphere.  Staff were friendly and seemed to know their regulars.  

Unfortunately, they close early (at least during the week - 3 or 4pm?) and I had to be kicked out .....which was done subtly through pulling the sign board in and shutting the blinds.  I would have preferred a "FYI we're closing in 10", but whatev, I'm the dummy that didn't read the hours before I walked in.

It's possible I'd come back, since I am in the Ahwatukee area quite a bit and can't resist a coffee with a kick!
As a vegetarian, I love looking at a menu and seeing plenty of vegetarian options.  These were even marked with a carrot - even better!  The group of us came for the beer, and weren't disappointed.  Many choices available.  

Of course we started with the cheese curds, which to me seemed like mozzerella sticks but whatever, they were delicious and served with ranch.  The mozzerella salad was pretty good - but I've had better.  It came with tomatoes, red peppers, and asparagus and was a good size, but I prefer mine with less veggies.  I also had to try the mac and cheese, which wasn't as creamy as homemade should be and served with a pretzel - talk about carb on carb overload!  

The service was great and fast, especially for our table of 6 on Homecoming weekend.
Jumbo momos. All of us had their steamed beef momos. It was cheap and you get ten of them bad boys. Definitely worth the price. The dining area feels like a living room convert, but it doesn't matter you come here for the food anyways. 

Super friendly service. The owner was all like 'goodbye handsome' as we were leaving. Thanks.
Phenomenal brunch menu and coffee.

The Hole in the Wall has quickly turned into my favourite brunch place in the Junction. I've eaten through most of the menu (though it changes regularly), and every item has been delicious from Full English, to Huevos Rancheros and duck confit poutine. Fresh, well seasoned-consistently scrumptious. 

The staff is always charming, engaged and knowledgable, and they are now serving great coffee from La Crema down the road. 

Highly recommended.
Della's Kitchen is the former The Cafe (of The Hotel fame) & I'm really glad that they didn't change the menu too much. The Delano breakfast is pretty much my favorite breakfast anywhere, any restaurant. I could never make scrambled eggs as fluffy as the ones here, and the slightly spicy Portuguese sausage just can't be beat. Jam used to be served in those cute little individual jars, but now you get a small ramekin & that's totally fine. They also have waffles, lemon pancakes with blueberries, & sandwiches. 

The feel at The Cafe always had an upscale vibe, like a place you could conduct some serious business.  Della's Kitchen has a brighter feel to it, making it a little more family-friendly.  The blackboard has 2 hilarious quotes on it. "WTF = where's the food?" and "Life is short, eat dessert first."  Skip the buffet & eat here if you are staying at Mandalay Bay.
Our first dining experience living in Madison! Will not be our last, either. Vintage has a dozen or so of their own brews to showcase. I had a pint of the bees' knees - an excellent honey beer that hosts the actual mouthfeel of a spoonful of honey. I ordered the quinoa cakes with chicken. Wasn't what I was expecting- pretty bland considering the ingredients. Chicken came out like chicken tenders. Service was great and decor is fun.
Cute little storefront with an awesome selection of pies. There are more options of cream-based pies rather than fruit but that's fine by me. The coconut cream is something to savor. Love it!
Tao is always a solid go-to spot when in Vegas. It's usually fairly easy to get a last minute reservation via OpenTable and they easily accommodate big parties. I've found that a later reservation is the way to go - maybe 9:30 or 10:00PM. That way they'll come around and stamp you for the nightclub so you can walk right past the line after dinner and pay no cover. Definitely a perk for a Friday\/Saturday. 

The food is good and has been consistent over the years. A sushi roll and appetizer is plenty for me before hitting the town. It's very easy to overeat here trying different items! The lobster dumplings are fantastic and so is the rock shrimp. Any sushi roll with mango and the sauce is a must try! 

Also - they make a GREAT dirty martini!
Really? I could've sworn I had reviewed Snapdragon already. Shame on me. I wasn't looking too much for a new salon when I moved, but after hearing about Snapdragon and passing it several times, I had to give it a try. I clearly remember the day I walked in to discuss an appointment and conveying that I needed someone that was not only good with color, but was okay with non-conventional color. One of the stylists there was actually sad she wasn't available when I was.

When I came in and met Janelle for the first time I knew I was home. She's hilarious and so good at what she does. She's given me the courage and encouragement to add bangs to my look for the first time since I was 8 and to grow my hair longer than I thought would look okay. She's given me recommendations for tattoo artists and we can talk local hangouts and even video games. Not only that but she understands I'm low maintenance\/tomboy when it comes to styling my hair in the morning and shows me maintenance that is low-key and fits with the reality of what I will do when I leave the salon.

The vibe is great, the prices are reasonable and it's now the place I call home. Bonus points because the coffee is also pretty amazing. Nothing is done half-assed at Snapdragon.
Mark is awesome and provided us with great service and product ! We will use him again with any other homes we buy.
I use to love Kona Grill!  We decided to go today for Mother's Day and I thought it would be hit, but boy was I wrong!!  The place was not busy. The bar - YES, but the restaurant..not so much.  We ordered the calamari and it was horrible!!! The calamari had no meat! It seemed like they scraped off the bottom of the fryer and served it.  I thought it had to get better, but then we ordered our entree.  We ordered the Hawaiian Ribeye and I don't even think it was ribeye! I think a porterhouse or something, but definitely not a ribeye.  We also ordered a couple rolls of sushi which weren't bad, but my whole dining experience was already ruined.  My mom ordered their asian salad and she said it was too sweet.  The whole experience was horrible.  Our server forgot to give us soy sauce for our sushit and we waited quite a bit to get it. 

Towards the end of the meal I'm thinking I just wasted $100 on garbage!

I'm going to take the survey tomorrow and hopefully it will change something. I really liked Kona Grill and I would like to return, but based on my last visit - I doubt it.

It may just be a hit or miss kind of thing and I hope that others don't have the same dining experience so don't go to this place expecting the worst.  I still have some hope for this establishment.
This facility is everything you'd expect for the price point. Clean, fairly modern, unfussy, standard bathroom. Totally fine. Where it shines is the customer service. Every staff here has gone out of their way to make this stay great. I had a small complaint and multiple teams addressed it so generously (without making a big deal). Kudos. I feel so cared for.
I ordered delivery tonight at 8pm and prepaid. At nearly 10pm the delivery driver finally calls and says he'll be there in 15-20. So, my food was cooked 2 hours ago and rolling around in the back of someone's car ? No thank you. Terrible customer service too the guy lied and said he just left the restaurant.. even though when I called an hour ago they said the delivery guy was out with it. I've called 5x requesting the refund and each time they hang up
Here on biz trip, didn't expect to find this kind of place in Phoenix, maybe Chicago or Cleveland but not here.  Had dinner with friend in bar area and had a great time.  Service was good to excellent, nice wine selection, steaks were also good to excellent.  As far as others comparing it to Ruth Chris (and other chain steak houses), well it ain't Ruth's... thank God!  No R. C. has this atmosphere and look, really old school but still real.  Parking in rear was easy and free.  Construction was going on in the street making finding the place and access a little tough but that may be over by now.  I grant you the place is not for everyone one but I definitely do recommend and will return.
This is not a pleasant review to write, because I've always enjoyed the Fireside lounge, and would go back there in a heartbeat when looking for a nice place to have a drink with friends.

However, the Peppermill restaurant seems to have gone downhill since our last visit.  The environment is still wonderful and intimate in its cheesy neon-y way, but something has happened to the food.  Namely, it's no longer worth the price they're now asking for relatively simple fare.

A basic plate of eggs and pancakes is over $10 now.  Omelettes are around $13.  Uh... what?  $3 for coffee... very, very oily coffee.

My chorizo and eggs featured overcooked scrambled eggs with very dried-out chorizo mixed in.  The beans that came with them were right out of a can and heated for way too long, until they were cracked and dry.

My wife's corn beef hash and eggs was runny, with canned hash underneath.  It was greasy and not very good.

Normally, I'd not be so disappointed by greasy or not well cooked breakfast food -- they're not called greasy spoons for nothing -- but for the price, the ire rises dramatically.

It saddens me to say it, but if you're after great breakfast fare in Vegas, go for Blueberry Hill, or Hash House a go-go instead.  You'll be much happier.  Maybe we just got a bad line cook that day, but the impression is going to stick with us for quite a long time.
Another five star Vegas hotel. Beautiful rooms.way too many restaurants to choose from. Shoppes everywhere. Great casino. Overall, a great Vegas resort hotel. I would recommend you stay at the Palazzo rather than the Venetian. I like the Palazzo better.
I came back in yesterday to have my nail fixed. Thank you, Nick, for doing such an amazing job on it! It's beautiful. I am extremely satisfied with it. 

Management personally reached out to me and I appreciate that. Coming from the service industry business, I have learned that guest experience should always be valued because this will leave a lasting impression. When management understands that, you are certain to receive only the best of what they have to offer.  So thank you, Nailed and Lashed crew for the awesome service recovery!
Is Liberty Market my favorite place to eat? No, but it is unique, sits in downtown Gilbert and just has that "likeability" quality. Their food choices are classic (sandwiches, salads, pizzas) and for the most part, tasty. I like the ambience inside, everything is wide open and welcoming. Staff is friendly and prices are reasonable. I guess I just can't say I love anything I've tried here. The margherita pizza to me doesn't really resemble a margherita pizza. There aren't slices of tomato, basil and mozzarella on top but sliced really thin and almost could pass a cheese pizza without the small strips of basil on top. I also recently ventured to try a dessert, which was highly recommended by the cashier, and I really hated it. I don't remember the name of it but it was essentially a brownie\/cookie made with corn flakes. It was overly sweet and had a very odd texture. No go for me! I recall breakfast choices being better and might go again soon to recall my distant memory.
Went here for lunch and really enjoyed the Cobb salad. Ambiance is great with tons of natural light.

Service was awesome and to top it off, the salty, chocolate chip cookie for dessert was still warm and so delicious!

Will definitely be going again!
The topic of Mrs Whites would frequently come up in the office place by a coworker who used to work near there, at the New Times. This past week though it came up quite often, often enough that on Monday, when we were planning our lunch out together for Thursday, we were so hungry by talking about Mrs Whites that it only took until shortly after 11 for us to pile in her car and head out for some good ol' soul food. 

I can't even begin to tell you how wonderful this place is. It's like walking into Grandma's kitchen and getting all those great meals you used to love and enjoy. My mouth was watering and my stomach was singing before I even had a chance to sit down. 

I like that all the meals are the same price. It makes it so much easier. I also like the selection of sides and dishes. The red kool-aid was delicious but not in a mason jar like Lolos.

The staff was very friendly. One of my coworkers was craving ox tail and it started a big discussion between us and our waitress. She mentioned that Mr. Larry might know when it was available again (they were apparently out of it that day) and he even came out to the table to talk to us. My friend also then got his ox tail. I tried it. It's really damn good. I'd probably order it if it was available the next time I came around.

I went for the 3 piece smothered chicken (fried chicken and gravy) and red beans and rice. Wow that is a lot of food. I devoured the chicken fairly quickly. It was delicious. Best friend chicken I've had aside from my Grandma's. The red beans and rice I had to package up and bring home. I had them for dinner tonight and they were just as delicious as I imagined. 

I also tasted one bite of the peach cobbler a la mode. Peaches are not one of my favorite fruits but damn did they do it right. 

If you haven't been here, it's a definite must. I'm not sure why you're still reading this. Pack up and go. Move it.
Interesting place with a wide variety of Artisan food and art\/pottery.  Very relaxed atmosphere but needs a bit of rigor around running a retail environment.  Check it out!
This restaurant is located in the Planet Hollywood Hotel Casino. We went for the lunch buffet which was around 22 bucks per person not including drinks. They have a nice sushi selection and they tasted good and fresh. There was also a nice selection of Japanese cold salads and hot entrees. Do not miss the udon noodles bar. They also has a nice desserts selection and a made to order crepe station. I would definitely return here the next time I am back in Vegas
Great customer service, very friendly staff. It was our first time there and the average interior didn't impress us at first but food was really good. We got a wet burrito and enchiladas as they were recommended by others, here on yelp. Both were awesome dishes and we definitely enjoyed it much more then expected. Will definitely go back.
Une fille dans un party d'halloween m'a conseillé ce resto...De plus, il est proche de mon travail. Alors,  vu mon horaire occupé...j'ai commandé. Je n'arrivais pas à rentrer sur leur site internet. Alors, j'ai appeler et demandé s'ils avaient des nouilles croustillantes. La reponses...oui et cela venait avec une petite soupe le midi et pour 12$. Comme la livraison minimale était de 15$, j'ai pris des rouleaux. 

Le tout est arrivé en 40 min environs. Je n'ai jamais vu un livreur avec un aussi manque d'hygiène. Désolé, mais c'est ça. Le monsieur ne sentait pas très bon. Il y avait des ongles noirs...(ok il s'est peut etre cogné) mais ses doigts aussi étaient sales. Mais c'est surtout l'odeur du monsieur qui ne m'a pas plus. Bref...j'ai ouvert mon sac...et il manquait la sauce piquante . J'avais aussi demandé un menu...mais il n'était pas là. Le tout 19$ plus tip.

Bref, avec le livreur et le manque de sauce piquante...j'aurai mis 1* . De plus, les nouilles croustillantes étaient tout dans un plat (pas les nouilles séparés) Alors, j'ai mangé cela avant les rouleaux. Et maudit que c'était bon....Le poulet les légumes et les nouilles WOW. J'ai laissé la soupe et les rouleaux pour le jour suivant. La soupe aussi délicieuse. Avec des gros morceaux de poulet viande blanche!!. Les rouleaux étaient ok. 

Bref...c'est sûre que j'irai...mais directement là-bas hahaha....plus jamais de livraison..!
Alright, I don't want to be short here honestly but... all I have to say is Dessert sticks and all you can eat pizza buffet.... What more can you say? and the different types of pizzas? UGH sooooo goooood... It isn't anywhere really special but you better believe it is well worth any money spent...
I have to say, when I first heard that Montelucia was opening, I was really excited to try out the resort.  Been there several times now and I have to say that I am disappointed for such a gorgeous place in a picture perfect setting, the service is not better.  I regret to say the lack of attentive service that goes with the resort setting prevents me from going back there on a regular basis!
Rude!

Happened to find a receipt from the nightmare we experienced with this towing company and I had not had a chance to write a review about it.

This actually happened about 2-1\/2 years ago during one of our weekend getaways in Las Vegas. We parked at the lot that was adjacent to (at the time) The Riviera on Las Vegas Boulevard South. There were two other cars there so we thought it was safe. It was around 9:00p at night. Wanted to see if the Groupon we purchased for the show Illusions, featuring German Illusionist Jan Rouven, could be redeemed even though the deal was purchased while the show was still at the Clarion on Convention Center. Las Vegas Strip changes so much, both casinos have gone bankrupt since and are no longer there. Illusions is now showing at the Tropicana. Sorry, I digress....

We parked and ran inside The Riviera to inquire if we are still able to exchange the deal for tickets to the show but unfortunately we were not able to. We were only gone for 10 minutes since parking the car and we came back to a tow truck from this company with our car already hooked to his truck! That was the scariest thing I saw and experienced. Hubby and I pleaded with the tow operator to give us a break and we told him that we did not see any signs and that there were other cars parked on the lot too. It was dark and he pointed to an itty-bitty sign stating that the lot was a private lot. I practically begged the guy to not tow our car since we were already there to claim the car but he insisted on bringing it to their impound lot, plus we don't have $360+ in cash that he was asking to claim the car. He finally agreed to unhook the car after 15 minutes of trying to reason with him. He was asking for $153 cash. Had to run back inside Riviera Casino to get cash from an ATM machine. I was just glad that he agreed to give us back our car right there but the guy was still a jerk, rude and a scam. 

Now we get paranoid in parking in public areas like that... I think these people are just waiting for victims to prey on. We were only gone for 10 minutes (maybe even less), how could he have showed up there so fast.

Review #0381
Most of the items here are priced double what they should be. I know it's for charity but why would someone pay more for used items than they would for the same item new on clearance?  I was interested in several items but definitely priced too high. They do have a lot of furniture here so probably a good place to check out for that.
Sunday funday at its finest! Whenever we get a chance to bring our friends from out of town here, they are completely in awe of the vibrant, fun, upbeat ambience. Think day partying meets sports spectating on lots of TVs with a DJ mixing upbeat, top hits in the background. Perfect weather 80% of the year allows for this open aired restaurant\/bar where you can see out to the street and watch pedestrians and cars pass as you party. Decent food with lots of menu options. All you can drink mimosa specials. Pair all of that with perfect patio seating and people watching some of Scottsdale's finest means you've got one fun, entertaining time! 

One of the things I love most about this place is that you will see people of all ages and backgrounds enjoying themselves. Free parking in Old Town Scottsdale is also a big plus. Jump on one of the "free" ($10 minimum) golf carts and you can hit up a plethora of other bars and clubs to get the rest of your Sunday funday bar crawling on!
So I went here today with the family. I must say I am thoroughly unimpressed. I got a taco salad and it came out already cold, even the meat.  My husband got a burger and was like meh. My daughter got the green chili soup, took a couple of bites then decided she was full. The uncle liked the pulled pork sandwich ok and the in-laws shared some ribs, they too said not so good. The appetizer was okish but the experience wasn't great. All in all I won't suggest this place.
I used to hate Kohls, they always claimed they had deals but everything was just the same or higher priced than everything else. But then I learned how to shop. I pretty much wont go without a coupon and then if you pay attention to their early bird and night owl deals you will get even more of a discount. We have bought two huge rugs there normally priced $200 and up and we spent way under $100 on them due to the deals that they have. So, it is a place you can get some great deals on anything from clothes to home decorations, or even kitchen stuff and luggage, but you have to pay attention to the deals.
I am happy to update this in a positive light. Our roof was replaced by Phillips Roofing and it was quite difficult due to the type of roof we had and that we are in the center of four attached patio homes. Consequently,  there were many issues, some of which were beyond their control. One was our skylight.  It had aged and all of the roofing work may or may not have caused a crack to develop which let rain in. Even though we couldn't be sure of the cause, Bill came over and looked at it for us and had his son install our new skylight free of charge. We appreciate their help and have no more leaks. :)
Came here for St. Patty's Day with a group of friends for St. Patty's Day.  The promo advertised free cotton candy, face painting, snow cone, balloons for the kids.

When we got there, ther were already a ton of kids there and all the families looke like they were having a good time.  There was a live band playing creating a lively atmosphere.

The area was enclosed so it was great to mingle with my friends while the kids played and ran around.  We were able to order food right from the outdoor grill.  And the food was served up promptly and quickly.

The 'family' portion of the party ended at 7pm so we left at 6:30pm.  When we left, the place was still plenty crowded and more people were still arriving.

West Addison advertised a fun time for all and they delivered~ we had so much fun!!
I have never been to the actual location I just order delivery.  The first time I ordered I was surprised at how quickly they got to my house.  The food was very hot and seemed fresh.  The food was good and my husband loved the homemade hot mustard.  He always gets the barbecue spare ribs and enjoys every last bite along with the fried dumplings with plum sauce.  I honestly think if I wasn't around he would just drink the plum sauce.  I get anything chicken and I do the combos.  I have had the sweet and sour, General Tso's, Sesame, and orange chicken.  All of the combos come with pork fried rice and the dinner ones come with an egg roll while the lunch comes with your choice of egg roll, soda, or soup.  My daughter gets the vegetable soup and eats every bite, I have had the wonton which is good and the egg drop.  My husband had the hot and sour and really enjoyed it.  Whenever we are short on money and high on hunger we order out from here.  It is really one of the best delivery Chinese places in this area.
Worst Allstate experience!  Melanie is NEVER available.  Her assistant is clueless and unhelpful.  After nearly 30 years of being an Allstate customer we switched to a different insurance company because of her.  After the terrible customer service we told them to not renew our policy.  Her assistant told us we will need to call back when the date gets closer because she will forget.  UNPROFESSIONAL.
I came here with some co-workers for a good-bye lunch. 

We were immediately greeted when we arrived and asked if we would like our coats taken. We were brought to our table and seated at a cozy booth which was perfect for our intimate occasion. Our waiter described the specials to us, and then was kind enough to say that he didn't want to rush us, but that he also had two large parties that had just arrived, so that we could get our orders in before these groups. I really appreciated that he took the time to tell us this!

All table members enjoyed their dishes. I ordered the grilled calamari (lunch size, not appetizer). It came with lots of calamari that was cooked well, although some pieces were slightly overcooked (not uncommon when grilling calamari) and drizzled with olive oil and garlic. It also came with polenta, asparagus, green beans, carrots, and roasted beets. The beets were delicious! My only complaint was that there was a bit too much olive oil on the calamari and the vegetables for my liking, but otherwise it was a great dish!

Throughout our meal we had superb service that had an air of quiet elegance, not the pompous over-the-top flair that you sometimes experience at higher end restaurants. The waitstaff were attentive without being in your face.
My dog is getting old and has been having some issues lately. I also had some questions.

Seeing the high Yelp reviews I thought I'd give this place a try. 

I called and was informed they were very busy today but could squeeze me in. 

The Vet was awesome! She took the time to answer all of  our questions regarding our aging dog. She understood our concerns and seemed genuinely empathetic.

Also found they board dogs here which is a big plus for us. I'm sure we'll be back if we have more issues or questions.
Mountain of fries, squeaky curds, ok amount of meat, your classic Smoke's Poutinerie. Staff is really friendly. Similar to other Smoke's chain, the food is there to only satisfy your cravings.

On Ritual.
Ok... So it's a Bojangles... Once you've been to one you've been to them all. Why 4 stars? Because I ordered 30 Bo-berry biscuits for my students and they made fresh ones in about 5 minutes. No complaints!
My tire had a screw in it at 8pm and my tire would not make it till the am and Lord forbid Ford to give me a spare tire in my new 30k mustang lol, then I remembered a guy at discount told me to go here after hours next time, so I did and they fixed it in under 30 mins and it was only 10 bucks!! They saved my night and morning!! There open 24 hours! Good people that are not gonna rip u off cause they are the only ones open at night.
This was a nice surprise for us. We left Las Vegas early to get out to the Grand Canyon, but did not want to deal with the crowds to eat there. Yelp came through with this little gem on our way. It is small. There is a parking lot out behind it. This is the old time local diner some still remember. The food is affordable, and you get a lot for your money.

I ordered a breakfast burrito. It was large, and tasty. It was stuffed with yummy goodness, eggs, sausage, etc. The coffee was also spot on. Our server was very friendly and helpful.

I had to small issues. One, the bathrooms are accessed from the outside. Not a deal breaker, but worth noting. Also, there was only one server and she was hustling to keep up. She did her best, but the service was consequently slower than I would have liked.

All that being said, it is still a great spot. Take the time to check it out.
My fiancé and I stayed at the Radisson Fort McDowell this past weekend and found the resort very modern, well maintained, quiet, relaxing, and romantic.  

I booked a standard king room but selected the "e-standby" option.  E-standby is basically a waiting list for a junior suite upgrade that only costs an extra $30 per night.  It's not guaranteed but if a suite is available at the time you arrive, you get the upgrade.  Receiving that really made the stay so much better...

The junior suite was awesome!  It had a kitchenette with a full size refrigerator, microwave, living room with balcony, large bedroom, and a beautiful bathroom with the most amazing jetted bathtub.  (I seriously had the best bath of my life there).  Since we had the fridge and microwave we picked up some light groceries and wine at a nearby store which was convenient and saved us a little money. 

We enjoyed laying in the sun with a pina colada by the immaculate pool each afternoon, gambling at the casino next door, a delicious New York steak dinner in the Anahla restaurant, and late night jacuzzi-ing.  Each staff member we came into contact with was smiling, friendly, polite, and helpful from the bell staff to the front desk and room service.  

Not one complaint. It was a wonderful trip from start to finish.  Hands down the best Radisson I've ever visited.  We will definitely return.
We love this place! The waffles are sugary and crisp on the outside but moist and fluffy on the inside. I usually get the banana, strawberry, and Nutella. Melts in your mouth!!!!
First time in the Cleveland area and decided to have dinner at BFG. The wait time was around 20-30 min, luckily we had friends holding seats for us in the bar. I don't remember our waitresses name but she was really nice and took care of our group. Wait times for food and drinks was not bad. We had crab cakes and calamari appetizers which were both great. For my entree I ordered Salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Salmon was cooked perfect, charred just right on the outside. If you're a seafood person, this place is great. This place was a little more crowded than other places in the area during the week, but not overly crowded.
One of the worst Starbucks I've been to. Slow to get drinks even when there's no one there. They do not get the drinks right, even if you spell it out for them. And it's dirty. I really have nothing good to say about this Starbucks.
Ordered chicken wings...and they were raw. They were actually raw, we could not believe it. Never have we gotten under cooked chicken from anywhere. 
Save your money and go somewhere else please. They obviously don't care enough about their customers to actually thoroughly cook their food. 0\/10.
Great Mexican food at a good price. Ordered a variety of authentic tacos and Mexican Coke. Service was great. I'll stop by next time I'm in the mood for tacos.
I visited the Dowd YMCA for the first time last night for a workout and a session in their steam room. Normally I'm a regular at the south Charlotte Y's (Morrison, Harris & Siskey) but since it's a new year, I figured I'd try my hand at visiting this Y after work, since it's only about 1.5 miles from my office. The reviews here helped to convince me to give it a try, so I figured I'd write my own review as well to add to the information.

I showed up around 4:45 and managed to find a spot. As soon as I walked through the turnstile I went to the guest relations desk and asked the woman behind the counter if she could direct me to the women's locker rooms. She offered right there to give me a full tour, so I took her up on the offer.

The facility is large, and as others have remarked, bustling. There were multiple basketball courts, two sets of lap lanes in the swimming pool (one warm, one cold), and all the other features you'd expect at a gym: spin room, tons of cardio machines just about everywhere you turned, machined weights and free weights. They had several stretch assisting machines and devices throughout the main gym area as well.

The women's locker room is indeed huge, and it's overwhelming at first. Lockers abound (I think there are almost too many, there's no way these fill up at 100%). I only found two toilet stalls in the women's locker room, but I'm pretty sure I must have missed another set somewhere. 

One thing to note: You need a full-sized padlock for these lockers. I have used a small luggage style combo lock at the Harris for a long time, but it doesn't fit the lockers at the Dowd. Fortunately, they'll let you borrow a keyed lock with a driver's license.

There are a limited number of machines (perhaps a dozen or two, treadmills, ellipticals, stair steppers, recumbent bikes and rowing machines) and free weights in the women's locker room, and most of them were in use. I opted to climb onto one of the stair stepping machines for 20 minutes to start. After that I wandered the rest of the gym and hopped on a treadmill for a few more minutes. The stair stepper action (it's been awhile since I've used a stair stepper) caused my calf to tighten up uncomfortably, so I only spent another 20 minutes on the treadmill. It's January and as you can imagine, the place is packed to the gills.

I decided to ease off and hit the steam room, which let's face it, is the real reason I go to the Y (well, this one and Harris, at least). I just force myself to exercise before I get to the "reward".

And this is where the Dowd Y fell short for me. The steam room was the driest steam room I've used, and the full, bright lighting made it  less relaxing than the one at the Harris. It's not serene and quiet, people chat and talk loudly in this steam room. 

Both the Dowd & the Harris Y have spray bottles of eucalyptus from a "Club Aroma" spa supply place. The eucalyptus bottle at the Harris Y is occasionally running on empty, but when it's filled it is good stuff. The "eucalyptus" at the Dowd was non-existent. They're cutting it so much with water (I presume) that it smells like nothing. The eucalyptus not only helps with opening nasal passages, it also makes the steam rooms smell nice, and this one - since there's no real eucalyptus to spray - smelled decidedly NOT nice.

Finally, there's something else others have touched on a bit: the rampant nudity in the locker rooms. Here's the thing - I'm a bit of a prude about nakedness, being as I was raised in the south and taught the naked human form was an evil tool of the devil and all. But in a locker room, I realize that's mostly MY problem, and that the occasional flash of full frontal or a butt is the price you pay for dressing and undressing around other women. 

There's a difference between flashes of nudity, and the women walking around the Dowd Y locker room for two hours, acting like they're in a nudist colony. Seriously, not a stitch on one particular older woman for two hours, as she stretched, dried her hair, lounged in chairs, and rubbed lotion on her face. I'm real glad for her that she's comfortable with the body she's got, but *I'M* not comfortable with it, and seeing her with her legs kicked up on the chair outside the steam room every time I entered it, just letting it all hang out, was disturbing. And it's not just about looks, I don't care how aesthetically pleasing your naked form might be, at least show a little courtesy and a slight amount of modesty.

I didn't find the steam room or the locker room relaxing after my workout at all last night. I saw things no human should have to see, frankly. I appreciate it's close to my office, but I've heard Childress-Klein is too, and a little better about these sorts of things. I'd recommend the Dowd Y, but only to people who really honestly don't care about having strange women exhibitionists waving stuff around in their faces while in the locker room. As for me - I care - probably too much to return.
They now have pumpkin spice bundt cakes available - in the mini bundtlet too!  I was told it's such a favorite they are offering it through the holidays - go get one!!  Yummmmy!
Such a good show, great for older people and children. Plus you get to see beautiful red rock & bonnie springs.
This place was definitely popping for brunch....just packed with people which was the reason for our long wait. But nonetheless they did not disappoint. Our mimosas and breakfast were all really good. The inside isn't that big but there's a lot of patio space too. We'll definitely be back during the spring for that too. The wait can be a little frustrating but it was definitely worth the wait. This place gets my brunch stamp of approval lol
This cupcake eatery has many combinations everyday- one can customize the cake of choice, filling, topping and decorations!  What will make you swoon, the frosting shots! I'm lucky enough in choosing pretty much endless cupcake combinations!  The place is always clean and tidy (you won't cupcake droppings on the small table and hairs inside;). Their frosting a always melt in your mouth and the chocolate ganache is a delight every time.  Why make cupcakes at home when at Madhatter you can go in and have any combination you choose of the menu ready within seconds for you! Also a single cupcake comes in a Chinese take out container:)
Nice concept but food isn't that great. What's with the cash only policy? I'm very iffy of restaurants with that policy (tax purposes...). Service is bad, i watched the sever wiped the table and let the crumbs fall on the floor. 

I don't get the hype of the potato waffle at all. I thought the potato waffle would be light and crisp, similar to latkes, instead I found the texture to be quite mussy. The poached egg is fine, I mean, you can't call yourself a brunch place if you mess up a poached egg anyways.

My friend got the Spicy chicken waffle for $12 and the chicken was dry and bland, no sign of jalapeno at all.
Ok, so here's the deal.

Bought the car, drove off the lot and saw that the right blinker was out. Took it back to the dealership because we hadn't left the area yet. 

Eric, our sales guy took it to the back for 5-8 minutes and brought it back to the front and said, "They didn't even have to change the bulb." 

I asked what the issue was and he said it might have been the cold weather or what have you. Cool. Thought nothing of it.

Until LATER that night, our blinker was out again.

I decided to make an appointment to have it checked out. I took it to a Certified dealer on my side of town. The warranty that we have is a joke - that's #1. #2, not sure if the first dealership was honest with us. If they looked at it, they would have seen the issue. #3, we had to pay half ($92) because a light bulb was out and "is not covered by warranty". So essentially, we had to pay $92 because a light bulb was "out". Weird though because the guy at the dealership previously said, "We didn't even have to change the light bulb." Hmmm.

Not going to accuse them of shady practices but let's just say next time I have an issue with my car (aside from huge issues like engine, transmission, etc.). I will be going else where. I feel as one or both parties jerked me around. And that's the crazy thing about it because they did fix the wheel issue, why not fix the wire issue as well???

Disappointed.
Was here on the grand opening night and it was fantastic! A toast & cheer on your grand official opening. Congratulations & best wishes.
This is a solid dinner option for a couple or small group. The portions sizes are not conducive to large groups for sharing. The decor is cool. The room is quite dark. We were sat on time per our reservation. While the food is good, I think it is priced high for what you get.

Given the tapas style I was able to try several options.
Salt & Pepper Frites come with a garlic aioli, romesco dipping sauce. The fries have good flavor, and the sauce makes them even better. This is a good sharing option.

Mixed greens comes with prosciutto, pine nuts and a cider vinaigrette. This is not ideal for sharing, but the portion is good for one so that is ok.

We tried a few of the wood fired pizzas. They were all tasty. The crust had good texture and flavor. The sauce was tasty and the toppings were solid. These are great for sharing.

I also tried the Hand Cut Beef Carpaccio. It comes with petit watercress, shaved radish and garlic & parmesan aioli. This was a solid choice. It could have used a little more flavor, but was ok. I do not like radishes so I skipped them and maybe they add that missing flavor.
Generous and tasty portions.   Definitely a local hot spot worth tying.    Company wasn't too bad either !  :)
We passed up nearby chain sandwich shops to grab a sandwich at Donna's and are so glad that we did!  Everything was incredibly fresh; we watched the employee put our orders together right in front of us.  The food was delicious and very reasonably priced.  I look forward to going back and trying other items on the menu.
Unique spot. You stand in line and they cook your burger on a grill to order. You then order your sides (fried zucchini, mushrooms, onion rings, fries, etc.) and pick them up on your way to pay the cashier. Be sure to bring cash - it's cash only! Once you check out, you put all your toppings on your burger in a buffet with all the fixings. You can pick your own table to dine at and sit inside or outside. 

Food was pretty good although the burgers didn't have a ton of flavor to them. Service was also good and I appreciated their attention to detail. For instance, the bacon on the burgers is in a circle so that each bite gets bacon. They're also constantly refilling the toppings on the buffet. Homemade root beer was great, but no refills. They offer all the burger toppings you could think of, trash cans throughout, misters if you're sitting outside and need to stay cool, and even a free parking lot - which is pretty unheard of in downtown Tempe. 

I'd return because the old western decor and concept are pretty cool. It'd be a fun place to bring a large group as long as you warn people to bring cash. And I can see kids loving this spot too.
Food I've had here is always 4-5 stars.  Usually we get take out.  

Recently we dined in for the first time.  Again, great food.  However, service was poor.  Not too slow, as others have noted, but just not friendly.  Our waitress had no smiles and was not friendly.  She was ok compares to the tall tattooed waitress, who just didn't seem to like people.  Hopefully she was just having a bad day, but it did not reflect well on the waitstaff.
I was born and raised in New Mexico and grew up with New Mexican food. My family made it from scratch so my standard is high. This place has the best NM chile and the food is the closeting thing to being back home taste in NV. Find out the difference between New Mexican and Mexican food by stoping by.
I've waited for a great local breakfast\/brunch place to open in this area and this place definitely hits the spot. 

The service is great. Whatever you want, they'll try their best to provide.

I've been to 2 of their other locations and the food is always great. Our food met that standard as well.

The reason this location doesn't get five stars is solely because as of today 5\/22\/16, they do not have their liquor license yet, in result, we could not have a mimosa with our food. Really disappointing since they've been open for months now.

Aside from that this place is A-1
Awesome little specialty store full of fun things! Paper Source really knows their paper. They have TONS of specialty papers for every occasion. But they also have tons of other things. I was particularly impressed with their collection of eclectic gift items. They also offer tutorials and classes to help you take your craft game to the next level!
This isn't as good as their Henderson location.  Sorry guys.  Parking is a nightmare.  You have to park around the back of the hotel.  But that is not the reason that it is not as good.  The best way to describe it is that the food lacked passion.
I couldn't resist trying this ENP after it was rebuilt.  Maybe it's just that I haven't been to an ENP in a long time (probably the better part of a decade), but I was just disappointed.  The service was truly slow (like 10 minutes to get water?).  The salad bar seemed to have half the selection I remember it having.  (No cottage cheese?)  On the upside, the ranch is as tasty as I remember and that was the real reason we went any how.  Then, my order was wrong (I ordered fried pickles... got a burger instead?).  Our server was beyond apologetic and it was fixed in less than five minutes, but hard to understand in the first place...  Interesting to note, we learned that ENP and Sheetz have the same food supplier.  My DH ordered jalapeno poppers and noticed they were virtually identical to the ones he LOVES at Sheetz.  Quick google search later... Yep, same ones.  

All in all, a cheap, quick Friday night dinner (even with the delays on ordering, we were still in and out in less than 45 minutes).
This has very quickly become my favorite Asian restaurant around! I've never dined in, always ordered carry out, and they're so quick and my food has always been perfect! And almost everytime I go, there are at least 2 or 3 other people there picking up orders as well.. Apparently my opinions are shared!  I LOVE that they offer such an extensive sushi menu!! My husband can get his typical "Chinese food" fix, while I'm able to have my beloved sushi.. and it's really good! My favorite is the Crunchy roll.. soooo good!
Smash Burger is my second favorite fast food burger place. Of course Fat Burger is #1. They have great burgers and fries here and I like the fact that they offer whole Wheat Buns.

The meat tastes better because the way they smash the burger on the grill. It Sears the meat and gives it that distinct taste.

I definitely recommend Smash Burger.
What a difference a new location with more space makes. I now kinda feel like I make up reasons to bring my car in so I can cowork at the awesome desk in the new sexy space 180 just moved into. Headlight out? 180 should be able to fix that. I feel like my exhaust pipe may be loose but I may simply be paranoid? 180 can check that for me. I don't like the song on the radio? 180 can fix that (well probably not, but I can still cowork while they amuse me).

The fact that there are more bays also means my typical maintenance gets done so much quicker too. I've been able to get in and out of the shop in an hour or so. And there's space to sit there. And a desk!!!!! A real desk. So I can sit down and be an adult and connect to the VPN and do all that work stuff. 

And the rest of the stuff I've always loved has still stayed the same. It's locally owned by and operated by some kick ass women. They always tell me what's going on with my car in a completely no bullshit, non-condescending way. The prices are reasonable. And they are very friendly. Most importantly, they truly care. 

Oh and, they're reusable cups they give as presents are amazing and well designed. Love!

So next time your car needs to be looked at, let me know. I'll bring it in for you.
Love this place my first was at galleria circle near sunset  station at the Henderson satisfied with all the meal i ordered .. and this place was alright because of the brocolli was really salty -.- the first two was alright until i bite the third and it taste straight up salt smh .. the ribs doesn't have the flavor i ate from the last time .. but always the cornbread is to die for im still giving this 4 star anyways ..
Great food and diner atmosphere. Well worth the wait if you come in on the weekend. Everything is fresh and made from scratch. We will be becoming a regular at this place for sure
This is a nice Malaysian restaurant on the second floor of a shopping plaza in the Las Vegas Chinatown area about 2 miles west of the Strip. We went there for lunch after driving all night from Wyoming and enjoyed the food so much we went back again for dinner. We had satay and roti chanai and rojak appetizers. We also had the nasi lemak udang mee and beef rendang. Food was delicious. We have to come back here again next time we are in Vegas
Although I didn't know it, I've been living under a rock for what must be ages because I had never heard anything about Fate. All you Yelpers must be in on some vast conspiracy to chat this place up on days when I'm outside sweating to the sweet sounds of backhoes instead of procrastinating on this site under the soul sucking fluorescent lights of the office.

Well played.

I wish I could say the same about Fate.

My dining partner (who is obviously in on the scheme as well) had heard rave reviews about this place from roommates and friends alike, so we swung by to grab a bite on a Thursday night. He was looking forward to a delectable Pan-Asian experience. I was just looking for something to satisfy my gnawing hunger. 

We didn't have a very hard time finding the place, which seems to be a common complaint, and stumbled upon a cute little converted house with a group of five sipping beers outside as they waited for a table. Since they're on summer hours or something, only one of the two houses was open, and none of the cool outdoor decorations (aside from the wicked Buddah head) were present. Just a tiny little stylized sign that stated, "Fate." 

I really hoped that the stars were about to align and the combined fury of the kitchen and wait staff would result in the culmination of its namesake. 

After entering the restaurant and approaching the hostess, I was startled by the number of empty tables in the place and pleased that we'd soon have some saucy, ricey goodness to sate our hunger. Unfortunately, that wasn't so. She made us wait outside, after specifically barring us from remaining indoors, for five minutes. Baffling, but no biggie. Then we were ushered into a tiny room at the front of the establishment that boasted Ikea decor and very little ambiance, so I can't even give it points on that basis, which also seems to be a big seller with reviewers. We also sat about a foot and a half from the table next to us and I had to listen to the most pretentious and vapid conversation I've been a party to in recent memory. Not good.

The waitress was very friendly and attentive, and we placed our order for a couple iced teas and the pot sticker appetizer. When it came time for us to order, she was great help with the menu and we decided on the Cantonese Black Dragon Beef and the Szechuan chicken. 

After paying four bucks for a bottle of Republic of Tea, which is by no means 'gourmet,' I was a little miffed but willing to ride out the experience and judge by food alone. Then the potstickers came on a bamboo platter and I felt those stars starting to drift into alignment. I raised one to my lips after dipping it into the sauce and the celestial bodies whizzed right by each other with no care for fulfilling their fate.

They were comparable to frozen Costco brand potstickers and the sauce they came with was heavy on soy sauce and light on any other flavor. I was too hungry to care so I scarfed my fair share, but my dining partner was completely turned off. Still, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe it was an off night in the kitchen. Then the food arrived with a little side of rice. 

It tasted a little better than your mom and pop corner shop Chinese, but it was on par with anything at P.F. Chang's. And if I can compare it to a nationwide chain, it doesn't deserve any more than a mediocre rating. My food was the perfect serving size, with just the right amount of rice, but the sauce was drastically different than any other szechuan dish I've ever had and the some of the chicken was diced into itsy bitsy little pieces that funked with the texture. I was really hungry, so I wasn't that critical, but my dining partner ate about three bites of his and declared, "I'm never coming back here again." To put it simply, he thought it sucked. Hard.

Fate is a restaurant that seems to cater to individuals that place ambiance very highly in their dining experience. The food isn't great nor is it well priced, but I may have gone on an off night, so I'm willing to give it another shot and possibly adjust my review. I'll just have to find someone else to enjoy it with.
This is a good co-op, with a generous selection for it's smallish size. Prices are better here than in some co-ops I've shopped at. Competitive with the big boxes, as far as I can tell. I have tried some hot-bar\/cafe items and quite liked them. The java jolt smoothie is amazing, as is the lemon pepper tofu sandwich!

If you can judge a town by its co-op, which I am prone to do, Pittsburgh proves to be a decent place to be a conscientious vegetarian shopper.
Really good honey walnut shrimp.  Ordered delivery.   Wasn't expecting it nearly as quickly as it came.  Was really pleased with the whole experience.   Delicious and quick.  What else could I have hoped for.
Love tacos. Solid street tacos. Sometimes gristly. Depends on the day. Can be a long wait.
I'm not the world's biggest Italian food fan. Mainly because most common establishments just up the tomato and call it pasta without being creative. I have to admit I never thought I'd ever step in this place either, let alone review it with four stars, but I am, and all thanks to a pasta loving friend and an indecisive day.

My review is based solely on their pasta primavera, which, after trying for the first time, I went back on my own to have it again. Three more times. This is huge for me. 

The portion is perfect sized and the vegetables which is mainly squash heaven is just perfect. The bread that accompanies it is soft and flavorful also. It's truly the perfect dish for a non tomato\/pasta lover like myself. 

The staff is really friendly and always strikes up a small conversation when I come in. The prices are reasonable and for the most part, it seems fairly empty every time I've stopped in. 

I don't typically crave pasta, but find myself craving this on occasion, which means it's top notch.
After an afternoon workout,  at our local YMCA, our energy levels were low. We decided to have a salad and stopped by the GFG for a light lunch. We were very satisfied with the freshness of our greens and the generous portion of feta cheese. We both added a protein, chicken which was well seasoned despite being a bit dry. Because our visit was well after the lunch hour, we may have gotten some leftovers. The warm pitas were a welcome addition. We enjoyed our lunch but will be mindful of the time we visit.
A small Filipino bake shop.  Don't expect the confectionary or pastry that you would find at a Japanese bakery, as their main focus seems to be on savory meat buns, plus a cheese-filled ones and some flan in the pastry case.  I picked up a baked chicken bun from the front counter (not the fridge).

The bread was pretty good though quite dense and without a lot of flavor.  It did have some sweetness that I enjoyed (second ingredient was sugar).

The finely shredded chicken inside was very moist and had a nice balance of sweet\/salty\/savory from the garlic, oyster sauce, and pepper.

While it wasn't as fluffy as other buns, the flavor of the meat definitely was a step above others, and the gentleman working the counter was cordial.
I love this place! The food is authentic and they always remember my name when I come in. I always get the barbacoa burrito and its never failed me! They are famous for their Chile Verde burrito..so I'll have to try that soon!
Now I'm not a frozen yogurt fan generally speaking, but happened one day to come here with some friends.  It is so clean and happy and inviting, and seriously, the logo is so damned cute.  They have dairy-free, and sugar-free options, and tons of toppings.  Also, the people who work there are always friendly and helpful.  If you get the rewards card and sign up for emails, they have frequent specials to help you fund your new addiction.
We've been here twice in the last few months and both experiences were fabulous!

The first was a happy hour for our friend who brewed a house beer with the brewery.  This was very unique to try his beer and we sat on the patio in a large group. We only tried the green chili dip which was delicious.  I loved the local beer selection especially the Papago orange blossom and four peaks hefe!!!

We returned a week ago for a birthday dinner and sat inside.  It was a lot more mellow and quiet inside. This time I ordered the pork tacos which were very good and seemed homemade.  It comes with a nice bowl if pork with a slaw, a bowl of yummy salsa, 5 tortillas, a dish of guac!

Amazing understated friendly service both times.  You can tell they like eating at thier restaurant!
Awesome pizza and wings!! Great and friendly staff , will definitely order again. Just became my new favourite pizza joint!!
Not a fan. Tried this place because it was affiliated with my apartment complex and servicing through them was supposed to be a convenience as I could drop off\/pickup at my apartment's main office. 

Needed a button on a pair of shorts replaced. Ended up waiting several weeks, calling multiple times with no follow up, and eventually received the shorts with a non matching button so it looks bad. My apartment complex actually ate the cost and paid for them because it was that bad of an experience. 

I called the business on several occasions and it rang and rang with no answer during normal business hours. The time I did get an answer, the woman I spoke to was rude. I also never got a follow up call on my questions about my order. When I did go into the store to ask about my order, I noticed a "hiring" sign. Hopefully they've found better, more customer service oriented employees!
Came out on a Friday night, around 10pm. I ordered the brisket ($13), it comes with a soup or salad and a side. I ordered asparagus and a cesar salad. The sauce they served with it was way too salty for me. I ate the brisket with the BBQ sauce on the table. The brisket was okay but dry for me. My grandmother ordered ribs, the St Louis ribs which have more fat than meat on them and the waitress failed to let her know that. We didn't get a refill on our water during our visit. The waitress barely checked up on us. The manager came over and asked if everything was okay and we informed her about the ribs and she said we could pick a desert of our choice for the inconvenience. Very kind of her, but the waitress came back with a nasty attitude. The food was okay and the service was not great. - again I'm used to Texas BBQ so yes my opinion is biased. And the brisket does not compare.
Good place to have a reasonable meal. Cool that everything is made out of an extremely small kitchen that you can see but the food didnt live up to the local hype for me.  Burger tasted alittle bland, and extremely large.   The restaurant is also very "packed" tables are very close together. Home fries option but no 'french fries.
Disgusted by their customer service! An employee was rude, forgot our order, unapologetic, gave us cold food, & made us late for church! When I told her the food was cold she said does she think she's goving me a lesson and the managers were no better. They told me there was no way to heat the food. Horrible service!
Every time we go to Vegas we always get excited to come here. Until we get there. 

There is something about it that makes us always forget get that while they do have factory outlet stores of a lot of cool stores, this place is a dump! 

The food court alone is enough to make me gag but, with all of the carts in the middle trying to hound you, you have no choice but to quickly turn into a store to get away from them, then while shopping in that store you realized, that everything is 30% off of a 50% markup, and then they slap the word "outlet" and then stand back and collect money. 

I realized this trip that everything they have there you can either find online, or at the same price as the regular stores, it's only worth going if there is a store there that you don't have where you live, but then you have to figure out if it's worth the $20 each way cab ride.
I recently went to Kaya's monthly vegetarian prix fix dinner, complete with wine pairings. I ordered all of the vegan options. I was not entirely impressed...

The amuse, a beet ceviche, was delicious -- I would have traded out my main course for a big bowl of it. The two bite portion was a true tease.

Course one was roasted potatoes, meh. These were served with a green tomato ketchup which tasted too much like heinz for me to give a shit. OK, it did have notes of apple which was slightly interesting. But also served on the side was a "sour cream" and onion dip that was pretty yummy and had hints of horseradish.  I think the "sour cream" base is the same as that used at Mad Mex.

Second course was Chilled English Pea Soup. I LOVE raw english peas, thus appreciated the imagination of this soup (I believe it was a raw dish). However, I would have just as soon cracked open fresh pods, enjoying the full texture of nature's candy. Toward the bottom of my bowl of soup, I realized that blenderization diminishes the essence of peas, and felt slightly sad.

Carrot-lime intermezzo -- fine.

Third course was a big disappointment. Roasted Porchini Arepas sounded exciting ("what are arepas?"), but it tasted rather plain. The arepa was dry; dying for some of that "sour cream" and onion condiment from course one. The mushrooms were delicious, as mushrooms are, and that is my only compliment for this course. Crispy sweet potato fries were served on the side, but again with no condiments and I had had my fill of potatoes at course one. This course lacked moisture and flavor all around.

So why three stars instead of two? Dessert was amazing. "Strawberry Pound Cake" is the strawberry short-cake I have been dreaming about for 13 years (about the length of time I have been vegan). Probably not all that difficult to make, but wow, those strawberries were good (I surmise they were local, yay)!

The mignardises, chili chocolate, was like a slightly spicy m&m. Cute.

To quote Kaya's website, "The menus emphasize flavor and variety, presenting familiar foods in exciting ways, and making exotic foods delightfully accessible." I feel that exotic foods were completely lacking from this meal and that the emphasis was placed on creativity with familiar foods. Plantains would have been an excellent substitution for one of the potato dishes. The meal was full of "American" flavor with very little suggestion of "island" influence (ie. lime and cilantro). Perhaps they strive to use local ingredients, which would be cool, but there were no indications of that on the menu. No, I am not going to lay into a discourse to define "American" cusine, but hey, the restaurant is located in the U.S., admittedly serves "fusion" styles and the kitchen boys were white; probably studied culinary arts in 'merica. I mean that one should not expect an exotic experience at Kaya, though one should expect, demand even, an imaginative and quality meal.

The wine pairings were all perfectly on point; I owe much to this in creating what was generally a lovely meal. 

The service was also excellent. We had come in from the rain and were soaked; the host brought us towels to dry ourselves. Our server made intense eye contact which, in my eyes, made her an attentive communicator.

The ambiance was nice, with exception for the tv airing CNN in the front corner; it wasn't obtrusive, but it was there. I did not care for the seating. The tables were close together, and there was a great distance across the table between my date and I, thus at Kaya, you will often be sitting closer to your neighbor than your companion. 

Thankful to the date who paid,
Heidi
I'm sure those that know me are not surprised my first review is of Solo Cafe. I can say without a doubt that it's pretty much my second home. 

I first stumbled across Solo due to it being connected to Altered Ego Salon & Spa, where i was able to order a tasty beverage from my salon chair. The first mocha was heaven and we have been inseparable ever since. 

One of my favorite elements of Solo is the atmosphere. It has a feel that is truly all its own. While the furniture and initial look may seem like the typical eclectic coffeehouse, I assure you it is so much more. The cafe has unique and comfortable furniture, games to play, books to read, and free wifi. The lighting is just perfect so that anyone can feel comfortable working yet also take a break and be instantaneously relaxed.

Equally important is their amazing menu and fabulous coffee skills. I can never get enough of the cherry danish and an iced peppermint cream, which is a tea-based beverage. I can also say that they have the best mocha I've had in the Phoenix area to date. 

Last but not least is the friendly staff. I love the few moments I catch the place mostly to myself and can enjoy my coffee or tea, break out the macbook to get some work done and have a side conversation about music or whatever else happens to come up.
There are so many better breakfast options within a 5 mile radius of this place. For the price, the food is just not good and the restaurant is severely understaffed. A 30-45 minute breakfast visit took almost 2 hours due to the wait to be seated and a long time to get service to order. I will skip this place from now on.
Never heard of this place until I received their flyer in the mail. It says that they deliver until 1 am on Saturdays. The menu looked delicious, and I was so excited to try the Westside Market pizza. I called at 12am to place an order, a lady answered the phone "Hi we're closed" and then hung up on me! Not sure if the place is new and the lady never worked customer service before, but it would have been better to have just not answered the phone. Awful, terrible first impression. Ended up ordering pizza from a reliable chain pizzeria, and probably won't bother to attempt to try this place again.
I hopped in here on my way past yesterday to post a couple of letters. Yes, not even parcels. One was for New York, so not your standard stampage, and I wasn't sure the other still counted as "Letter" as it was quite thick (17 pages. I ramble. You know that.)

I wombled in at lunchtime and was surprised by how short the queue was. I'd thought that somewhere this central would be jam-packed, especially at lunchtime, but not so, and the queue was moving along at a fair lick, so kudos to the folks at the windows.

I, however, poor soul that I am, fished out my envelopes and was instantly barked at by a lady on patrol. "STAMPS? YOU WANT STAMPS?" - and she hustled me out of line. There's an express queue for postage, it seems, of which I was unaware; my regular post office is the one on St Mary's Street - infinitely more compact and manual - so I wasn't used to the idea. Oh, provincial me. It was helpful of her, but she was also slightly alarming and officious in her manner, which kind of made me want to take these lengthy epistles, toils and spoils of my aching hand and brain, and run for the wind. "I won't let her hurt you," I would whisper as we fled down to the shore... But fortunately, reason prevailed, and I was swiftly served with the correct postage. A point here and there at the card machine and she bustled off to find somebody else.

I feel a warm fuzziness about post offices not dissimilar to that which I feel about Christmas, and so I wasn't equipped to deal with this mild intimidation. Trying to claw back some of that festive posty spirit, I pulled my international stamp for the New York missive out of the machine, and bounced excitedly. I'm no avid philatelist but I do love to see a pretty stamp with a picture on it. "Look, it's all colourful and pretty!" I squeaked to the customer at that moment replacing me at the machine, and pointed at my picturesque postage stamp. I was met with a derisive stare. Oh. Not that kind of post office then.

Still, it was light, it was quiet, and I got everything done quickly that I needed to do. I wouldn't avoid it if I were nearby, but all else being equal, I would choose the queues and jovially messy jiffy bag walls at teeny weeny St Mary's Street over the efficient brusqueness of Frederick Street.
Regular movie theaters have been ruined for me. Esplanade is fantastic and while it's a bit of a drive for us, it is a a theater  I will gladly put miles on my car for. Between the two types of theaters, I would recommend the Cinema Suites. These theaters are smaller (less people to annoy you,) no kids allowed,  the cushy seats recline, no one can kick your chair (you're in your own partitioned row,) and best of all you have your very own server in your very own reserved seat.

It's in a great part of Phoenix, the Biltmore area has plenty of options should you choose to have dinner outside of the the theater. Make sure if you park in the garage you have the front desk validate your ticket. Also, reserve tickets online before you head out the door. The theaters are small and sell out very quickly. Looking forward to seeing The Dark Knight Rises midnight premier this week and NOT have to wait in line! God bless reserved seating.
I'm Thai. I love the food here and the outside dinning is so so beautiful. The larb is great. I asked for galanga to be added in and they did this for me. This place is beautiful.
Stopped in here this evening for a drink. Bar was packed. We managed to squeeze up to the bar and order a drink. We had to take our drinks to a table as there was nowhere at the bar to sit.

The bartender noticed us as soon as we came in. This is a plus. Seems a lot of bartenders tend to ignore you for awhile unless you're a regular.

We also ordered a basket of fries which were quite tasty.

So why only a 3 star rating? We're new to the area and we're looking for a friendly type of bar. A place where customers actually talk to each other rather than hunch over their poker machines.

This place is nice enough but it's made from the same mold as many of the bars in Vegas.
Been coming here for years, and it's always just as good as the first time I came. A little hole-in-the-wallish, but that's part of it's charm. It's fine, no-frills delicious Mexican, with excellent chips and home-made hot sauce. Just about every item on the menu is a winner.
Went here to eat today with some family members and when we first entered we were pretty excited. It's had some renovations and the dishes popping out we're looking good. I left most of the ordering to my brother and sister in-law while I watched my niece.
A salad came out first that wasn't really touched but next came the butter chicken. If an Indian restaurant can't make butter chicken right then we have a problem. It was good but been there done that. Next came out a vegetarian dish with lentils. Wasn't bad and out came our plain rice. Oh and plain naan and garlic naan. 
The food was ok and overall everyone seemed content with the portion. Just shy of being comfortably full. The wait staff is very nice and water is going around regularly. They did forget to bring out one dish that we were anticipating the most. A sizzling beef dish but it never came out.
Not a great meal and I probably won't return. The food is the same as almost any other Indian restaurant I've been to. This wasn't my brothers choice either. It was my sister in-laws and she was quite disappointed as well.
Loved it. The server was helpful with picking out an entree and informing on wines. We had the caprese salad family style with fantastic heirloom tomatoes and mozzarella from Italy. Delicious. 

At the server's recommendation I had the raviolini and did not regret it. The sauce was fantastic, the pasta tasty and the short rib beef was good as well. I was skeptical about "vegetable confetti" but it was a good way to add some variety to the taste. 

For desert the tiramisu or die.
Sinclair is a gas station and pit stop in a strip mall, just past the huge Rental Car center on Gilespie that serves McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas.

This is where you go to fill up that rental car before you return it half empty and get charged $10 per gallon for not refilling it or taking the Fuel Option at rental time. 

They have a pretty good size convenience store here, and this being Las Wages, there are the ubiquitous slot machines. Except here, there are a bank of sit-down slots. So you can set a spell and get your last chances of luck in if your flight has been delayed. 

Just don't forget to return your car on time, or you'll get charged another day's rent after you are 1 hour late!
The gym itself is massive and looks wonderful I will say that.  That's not where the problem is.  I was looking to sign up with a gym so I came in to "try us for free" which is all over their website and advertisements that I have seen.  Maybe the front desk girl is new, seemed like she had no clue what to do.  Eventually I signed forms and was taken back to a salesperson to try to get me to sign up.  I completely understand that this person's job relies on them persuading you to sign up immediately, I get it.  However, the attitude and arrogance that I received when I explained that I was very interested in joining but would just like to try the gym out for a day was completely shocking.  I myself am a small business owner and understand the importance of customer service.  I could not believe how rudely I was treated just because I did not want to immediately hand over my credit card then and there. This salesperson upon being totally blown away that I would like to wait to sign up, then proceeded to bring who I guess was his manager into the room who doubled down on the arrogance and shame routine.  I guess some people are shamed into just going ahead and signing up?  Normally I think I would have given them a piece of my mind but I have to admit I was so shocked by their tactics I just walked out and didn't even work out.  This place is driven by one thing $$$$
I had been to Sukho Thai before for dinner and I had ordered delivery from them before, but this was my first time going for lunch. This review will be based on my lunch experience.

I came with two other diners, one if whom was both vegan and following a gluten-free diet. Our server was very good about informing her which dishes she could have and she went back to the kitchen to ask if she was not sure.

The dishes we ordered included the Thai red curry with tofu (vegan and gluten-free), the curry lunch special of the day (comes with chicken), the Thai cold shrimp rolls and the mango salad. 

Everyone really enjoyed their meals, and my two dining companions who had not been to Sukho Thai before both agreed to return; however, there were a few small glitches that prevented Sukho Thai from receiving the full five stars on this review.

1) The lunch curry special of the day cones with a considerably smaller portion of curry than you would receive with the full sized portion. Granted, it does cost less than the full sized dishes; however, when it is promoted as the special of the day, you think you are receiving a deal or good pricing. It would be nice if the lunch menu indicated that the servings were lunch sized portions.

2) One diner ordered the Thai cold shrimp rolls and the mango salad as their main course. This dishes arrived about five minutes before the other two dishes, which isn't a big deal because they are cold dishes so don't need to be eaten immediately, but it's still a bit awkward to have them sitting on the table while you wait for the other meals to arrive. These dishes could easily have been held back in the kitchen until the other diners' meals were ready, and then all of the meals could be brought out together.

3) While service was attentive during our meal, we had a hard time tracking down our waitress once she had cleared our plates and we wanted to pay our bills.

Overall it was a satisfying lunch and I will return. I would recommend making reservations before you arrive - you don't want to disappoint your Thai craving if you are faced with a wait!

One bonus of Sukho Thai is that it does take reservations and has incredibly similar (if not identical) dishes to Khao San Road (as they used to be owned by the same people) which does not take reservations and you may encounter a two hour wait for a table there!
I'm not sure how a Mexican'ish place runs out of white rice when it's a main staple but they did. This location is hit or miss. If I were you, I'd miss it and head down the road.
I think the hype of this place is overrated however, you can definitely tell this place is more authentic than most. Some of the servers didnt even speak English. Hubby and I came for dinner on a weeknight and we barely got a table to sit and eat, we had the table in the back corner (the smallest table there). Service was pretty non-existent because there were so many people there so we ordered drinks and food at the same time. For a place that's called house of egg roll, you would expect egg rolls. They had 1 option on the menu and were then told they were out of egg rolls! We got egg drop soup, Mongolian beef, general tso's chicken and house biang biang noodles. Everything was super bland. The house biang biang noodles were gross, just my opinion. The Mongolian beef was the best thing we ate. Food did come out quickly, which was nice. We didn't get approached for a refill on drinks or to see how everything was. We had to wave down someone just to get the check. I think this place would be great for takeout but definitely not a nice dine in experience.
I had my first visit to Salon Jo-El last week.  From the moment you arrive, it is a pleasant experience.  I really liked the ambiance and the staff.  Upon arrival, you are offered a beverage, while you wait.  The music being played is ecclectic and well chosen.
I had my hair cut, dyed and styled by Rachel Bonn.  WOW!  She did an awesome job!  I arrived at the salon, with long, lifeless hair and left with a shoulder length style and color that brought some excitement back to my appearance!

Rachel was absolutely fabulous and so was Joel, the owner of the salon.  Joel gave some advice on what to do with the cut and he was spot on!  

I highly recommend this salon!  If you want to look modern and stylish, this is the place to go.  You won't regret your decision, I promise.
Love this place!!
i am addicted to their pimento burger with crispy onions. Not overly spicy and the smoked jalapeno pepper mayo is very complimenting to the juicy grilled beef.The fries are delicious,perfectly crisp.The limeade washed everything down perfectly.
i did not feel heavy after polishing off their burger and fries 

Will definitely go back to try more on their menu
Great lunch spot. I love the Caesar salad with a piece of grilled salmon. It compliments the salad and the anchovies, it is always good. The whole experience is great starting at the front desk which is staffed by friendly personable folks, that are always friendly yet professional. Every one of my guests comments about how they were made to feel welcome coming through the front door.

Great staff and some good food, don't miss the stuffed peppers.
Wanted to branch out & try something different, so one dinner was at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill.  I recommend getting reservations, because this place was packed!  And don't flake on your reservation, either.  These guys mean it when you make a reservation because if you no-show, they charge you $50 per head!  Opps did you oversleep?  That's a pretty expensive nap you just took.

It's right by the sportsbook at Caesar's Palace.  We arrived right on time and were promptly seated.  The menu isn't quite as big as I was expecting, so we were able to narrow it down to 3 things, with pictures attached.  Ranked in order, they were:
-scallop salad.  Micro greens, 3 scallops with a slightly spicy dry rub, and balsamic vinegar-like dressing.  Scallops were perfectly cooked and definitely the highlight of the dinner.
-lobster.  It's cooked and taken out of the shell, so it's easy to eat and therefore you're not creating a mess in a fancy Las Vegas restaurant.  Mrs. C states that the sauce tastes like reduced bisque, and quite delicious.
-pork tenderloin + twice baked potato.  The 3 pieces of pork tenderloin had a spicy dry rub, and then are nicely plated with 2 more sauces.  I have a pretty good tolerance for spicy food, but this was a tad too spicy for me.  The twice baked potato was good, but I should have gotten it without the horseradish.  Our server, to her credit, told us that the horseradish is mixed in, but not spicy.  She was right and it wasn't spicy, but knowing what I know now, I would have skipped the horseradish part of it.

This is a good meal, and there's no question that there is a lot of attention to detail to the food and our service was quite good.  I just think that for the money spent, this is an average value, and that's why I marked down 1 star.  Our dinner the day before at Sedona Lounge was only half the cost per person, and I was much happier.  But sometimes it's about the experience and crossing items off your bucket list, and if you can't do that in Vegas, then you might want to check if you still have a pulse.  =)
I wanted to post a review on the waitress we had for Smunch yesterday, Nancy, but it looks like I can only review a business so I'll just update this one.

When I walked into Scott's this week and asked if I could make a reservation for a large group during Saturday brunch hours, they said no problem without any hesitation. When organizing Smunch every month, this is a lovely thing to hear. 

The table was already set up and ready when I arrived and people started gathering shortly after. We wanted separate checks, though not all separate and Nancy didn't miss a beat. She was amazing. And hilarious. She joked with us the entire time and told us of her serious karaoke schedule.

At one point, someone at our table got up for a minute, and shortly after their food came out. Nancy just sat right down and pretended to eat it. And let us capture photographic evidence. 

I now will come back more frequently. And sit in Nancy's section every single time.
We know the FOX is clever, the restaurant concepts they come up with are like little magical yellow bricks down the yellow brick road that is lead by the Peter Piper and when one opens, people gather.
I love the concept of the Yard, group seating, plenty of games to play . . . and there were plenty of groups there.  
Now I know FOX is deft and any restaurant is all about maximizing the potential for the almighty drinks and serving of food.  
Unfortunately, at the Yard, service of food and drinks failed miserably.  There were a large group of us Elite Yelpers there with our friends celebrating some Dec. birthdays . . . yet, there weren't enough seating and I seriously stood there for almost 2 hours and not ONCE did a waiter come by and ask me if I wanted anything to eat or drink.  And I was more than ready to order something to eat and drink!!!
All those potential loss of revenue I saw all around me.  I'm thinking, "if they would do the order and deliver system differently, the nightly intake would certainly double if not more!"
I don't know what the solution is, but if I were FOX, I would send someone FOXY and brainy to spend some time to analyze the situation and come up with a procedure where the plentiful patrons are serviced because at the end of the day, you are still running a restaurant and not a free playground for the grownups.
HP wanted $300 to replace a 500GB hard drive.  I was referred to Santos and he delivered.  He is very friendly and professional.  Price was more that fair for the expert knowledge he posses...cost me $165.  May his business continue to prosper.
We have ordered from Trimurti for 5 years. I still love their food but I won't be ordering from them again. 

They didn't deliver my rice that I paid for this evening. When I called to let them know the manager refused to send someone with the rice and would only say he would comp rice on my next order. Unacceptable.
First time eating here, only problem is.....I wanted another pizza!!!!!! Great food and ambiance....def get sangria
This is another relatively new Pittsburgh restaurant (a year or so old) that I've wanted to visit for a while.  I tempered my expectations but entered with an open mind.  

It's a small space, so reservations are a must.  While we were seated I saw at least three parties turned aside who had walked in with hopeful gleams in their hungry eyes.  No soup for you, last-minuters...boyscout up next time.

We did the chef's tasting menu complete with wine pairings, and while I swear I was sober when I left, I can't remember half of them.  

There were bright spots:
My absolute favorite of the evening was the Foie Gras
 Onion, Marmalade, Nut Butter, Balsamic, Brioche (from the menu).  The waiter told us that it was the chef's take on PB&J, and if that's the case then I wish the chef was packing my lunch because I'd eat that every day for the rest of my life.

The accompanying wines were also great.  And I can't complain about the Tawny Port that accompanied the dessert because I don't like port regardless...so toss that.

The plating.  I can't think of another restaurant in the area that pays as much attention to plating as this one.  It was beautiful.  Often better than the food itself.

Originality.  There are a lot of great flavor combinations and ingredients that you aren't likely to find elsewhere.  I like that.  I like trying new things.  I liked the use of liquid nitrogen to "freeze brulee" the dessert, or the palate cleanser, for example.  New and different can be a fun little food adventure whether it ends up being amazing or bombing.

Which I guess brings me to the less bright (but not deal-breaking) spots:
There were a couple courses (the cured beef and the beets for example) where the plating wrote huge checks that the food itself was unable to cash.  Not that it was bad.  But I had hoped for better.  All in all of the 8 courses I'd say two (the foie gras and the tartare) were excellent.  The rest (including the aforementioned original dessert) were good, but not five-starrable.

Wait staff seemed knowledgeable, friendly and efficient.

Space was, as previously stated, intimate.  Decor..."original".  See other yelpers' pictures for the...napkin-wrapped, fish hook suspended dried flower arrangements...

Good date venue.  Good venue for an evening with adventurous foodie friends.
Came across this spot on the way to the Phoenix Children's Museum - coffee is a must if you're gonna survive that place. I had no idea Street Coffee is owned by the same owner of Tasty Box, which I had already bookmarked because the concept looks so interesting. It was nice to be able to order food at Street Coffee from Tasty Box even though it's next door. 

The barista was super friendly and patiently explained their specialty coffee drinks and the Tasty box concept, which is basically a bento box. I went with the Southwest latte and it was wonderful. Not too sweet and just enough caffeine. Next time I plan to try the Southeast. They had samples from Tasty Box at the counter, which sealed the deal for me since the southern comfort box with shredded chicken and cabbage was wonderful. Although it wasn't the traditional down south cooking I'm used to, the flavors were still on point. The cost is around $10.50 which isn't cheap for the portion but you can tell it's made fresh and with love. 

Once you order your food you have to go next door to Tasty Box to pick it up. The two shops are basically in old houses converted into restaurants, like many of the other downtown Phoenix spots. I didn't get a chance to check out the inside of Tasty Box because I held it down with the babies and strollers while my friend went and picked up our food. Next time I definitely want to go inside. 

Cool place and I will return when I'm in the area to check out more coffee and Tasty Box items!
Taco Hell. Cheap mass produced horse meat (allegedly), plastic yellow "cheese" in a high fructose corn shell, YUMMY.

No seriously, it IS yummy. I indulge in Taco Bell every now and then, when I'm not eating Chipotle - being all snobby and high-sadity (pretty sure "sadity" is not a real word but it stays). 

Sometimes you get a pretty decent taco or a good cheesy gordita crunch.

Other times you get a broken shell with barely any mystery meat or the cheese on the cheesy gordita crunch is not even melted. 

I will say the lettuce always seems fresh, hahaha.

If you've never ate Taco Bell before, don't.
This is a cool little coffee shop located in Boca Park. Of course that means it is difficult to find a parking spot, which is why I don't frequent Boca Park as much as I would like.

The coffee here is good and the store has that coffee house vibe going on, but the service was so slow. The servers were very pleasant and friendly. It looks like management does not staff the store accordingly to meet the volume of customers. There was plenty of seating. There are two levels, plus there is patio seating.

Overall it is a cool place to kick back and have a coffee and grab a bite to eat.
Great little neighborhood bistro. Love the atmosphere and the tapas styled food and wine is great.  I will be back many times. I really like this place just before going home so I am good and relaxed.
This place is great! TB shot was only $25, the staff was friendly, and they are always super efficient!
Since moving to Charlotte, I have been on a hunt to find places to satisfy the random cravings of my Denver staples. One of those cravings are arepas from the Quiero Arepas food truck. If you ever find yourself in Denver, make sure you track them down! So, I found Arepas Grill (thanks, Yelp!) and I headed down to check them out. Just a note... The street address on Yelp is wrong. It is located at 4740 Old Pineville Rd #A. Right next to it's sister restaurant, Colombian Bakery. I walked in and the place was empty. No seriously, there weren't any employees... I waited for a solid three minutes until someone showed up to help me out. Which was fine, as it gave me time to look over the menu. I decided on the Carne Mechada arepa ($6.00) and maracuya (passion fruit) drink ($3.00). He took my order and disappeared to the back. He reappeared a bit later with a freshly made arepa. He proceeded to cut it open and stuff it with the shredded beef and cheese. I asked for the spicy, avocado sauce that I am accustomed to having my arepa served with. The passion fruit drink was awesome! Very fresh tasting and refreshing. I'm on the fence about the arepa. I like how fresh the arepa itself was, but I wasn't really impressed with the fillings. It was definitely tasty, but I am used to my arepas being fixed up with more than just meat and cheese. A little more garnish would have put them over the top! This place could definitely earn the fourth, and even fifth, star easily with a little bit of improvement. They should take a look at Quiero Arepas menu! I would be psyched if they added something like the La Havana to their menu! I'll visit Arepas Grill next time an arepa craving strikes!
Casey is the best hairstylist, have been going to him for years and am never disappointed!
I have to say, having read some of the previous reviews here I was a little bit concerned going to this place, mainly on the account of service. Luckily my worries were allayed by a very pleasant young gentleman who attended to our table and was very helpful with the choice of food and wine. Since we went for the stone cooked food experience I can't comment on other dishes, but the two orders of  stoned meat and fish arrived in a very timely fashion and when we asked for an additional stone to replace the one that was getting cold, we got right away.

As far as the stoned fish and meat go, they are what you'd expect: no seasoning except for salt. So you will definitely experience the full flavour of whatever you're having (we decided to go the whole hog and tried kangaroo, venison, wild boar, tiger shrimps, sea scallops, salmon and tuna; my personal favourites were tuna and venison, and I'm still wondering what part of kangaroo looks very much like a sausage). The potions were quite generous and we couldn't even finish what we'd ordered.

If I had to criticize, there're two things I'd like to point out. First of all, the place has no cooking hoods over the tables, so the odour of whatever you're cooking (especially meat) will linger for some time and will make you smell like a boar too. This is somewhat alleviated by the size of the place, but is still an oversight in my opinion. Secondly, while the stones are more than adequate to cook sea food and vegetables, they are not nearly big enough to cook any decently sized steak. They just don't retain enough heat and even if you use a succession of 10 stones all you'll end up with is a shoe sole like crust on the outside and an absolutely raw meat on the inside. So you have to cut the meat into smaller pieces, which does make it less juicy.

Overall I liked the place  (very nice service, great atmosphere  and unique experience), though they definitely could've put more thought into the details. I would give it 3.5 stars, but since it has to be an integer I'll have to round it down to 3.
4.5\/5! 

*Overall a phenomenal meal at Richmond Station. The restaurant have more of a casual and laid back feel, and despite arriving near the closing time, the servers never rushed us to finish the meal.

*I recommend the chef table or get a seat at the back as you will get to oversee the chefs preparing your food. 

*There weren't too many selections on the main menu, but definitely check out their daily menu! It just screams fresh and seasonal ingredients! 

*We were given some housemade chocolate when we got our bill. A bit too dark for me but nonetheless still delicious..

-Polenta Fries - $8: 
Despite the small portion, this is a must order!! The fries were crunchy on the outside, soft inside with just a slightly melted shredded cheese on top. Polenta itself can be bland, but these were salted just right with a delicious and tangy tomato sauce!

-Tuna Tartare - $9:
The tuna tartare was placed on top of a black pepper crisp, topped with crema, mint and pickled chilies. I didn't enjoy this dish as I felt the pickled chilies were so spicy that it prevented me from tasting the fresh tuna. The crema nor mint didn't help to ease the spiciness either, overall a very disappointing dish.

-Duo of Pork: Pork headcheese & pork loin - $25: 
The duo of pork consisted of panko crusted then deep fried pork head cheese and roasted pork loin; topped with pine nut, yogurt and all of this deliciousness sat on top of a tomato chickpeas ragu and roasted sweet potato. For those who don't know, head cheese is essentially a sausage or bologna made out of boiled pig head. I have had parts of the pork head in the past, however this was my first time to have the ENTIRE pork head. To be honest it had a standard pork flavors and texture, so don't be afraid! Also, these were panko crusted and deep fried, and as I always say, deep fry makes everything taste better! The pork loin was juicy, the ragu was hearty and amazing, however I found the sweet potato was a bit undercooked. Though the yogurt sauce might sound strange, the tanginess really helped to cut down the dish as it was quite heavy

-Sweet Potato & Cheddar Perogies - $23: 
Another must oder at Richmond Station! The perogies were soft and the seared crust added some texture and eliminated the stickiness. They were filled with cheddar and sweet potato, a bit on the heavy side but the accompanying beet puree and and tangy sour cream lightened up the meal. The caramelized onions, fennels and sauteed swiss chard paired well and helped to balance the dish. With that said, I didn't quite get the flavor of the cinnamon cap mushroom
The wait for drinks at the back is terrible.  Get your drinks just outside the arena in the store in the hallway, and bring it in in a plastic cup.
I'm feeling *HOT* HOT *HOT* 

They told me that they have the hottest studio in town. That's no joke. Classes are short and sweet. You definitely get your sweat on. Look for discount deals on their website and daily deal sites. They seem to always be running something. Bring a mat, towel and water  and you'll be set.
Really excellent tacos and the salsa is flavorful and perfectly spicy.  The people who run the place are really kind and gave my aunt and uncle a taco sample on the house while the waited for us.  Really good food made by good people, what more could you ask for?
They have a lovely window treatment section! This area also hired two lovely ladies- Lorna & Rosa;)  wonderful dispositions and quite the window treatment experts!  Tip! One can open a JCPenney card, receive a percentage off (not a shocker huh most stores provide that)!  However, Lorna and Rosa are great at providing the other discounts running specials such as friends and family etc. these two lovely ladies take the time in providing their knowledge for the right fit!
Now, Joe (a fellow born & bred NYer) is in the customer service area, this is in the kitchen area.  He's great as well!  
Another bonus is this location has a scaled down Sephora- go LVMH.
I went to this airport foodery with thoughts of getting a great Oaxacan meal at Sky Harbor Airport. But that was a fantasy. Not sure why I ever thought that, maybe it was just the Oaxaca name.

This is burritos to go. I ordered a Machuca Oaxaca burrito, Machuca being shredded beef mixed with onions and chilis. 

The Burrito was surprisingly small. I agree with Eli's first review. It was not that tasty, and it was real watery or wet. I went through 10 napkins, because everytime I squeezed the burrito by taking a bit, a puddle appeared below the burrito. It got to be irritating, as I didn't want greasy stains on my clothes, so I was trying real hard to wrap up this burrito so it wouldn't leak from the bottom. 

It still leaked. After every bite. A little puddle I would wipe up with yet another napkin. 

The chili sauce was spicy, and was perhaps the best thing about the food. 

Machuca Burrito and drink totalled $8.53.

I hate to admit it, but It made me crave for Chipotle!
Wish that I could give this place 0 stars. So my sister just got a tooth extracted and we were doing what the doctor said to pick up her prescription. And we pulled up to the drive-Thur and you would've thought that Satan was on the other side. Pam, answered and immediately just starting treating us like pieces of trash yelling at us Through the drive through. And being an absolute b****!!!!! Me and my sister could not believe what Pam was saying as my sister was bleeding from her mouth!!! This place will never get anymore of my business!!! Or any of my friends business!!! SHAME ON YOU PAM!!
I'm in love with bread they serve here... or should I say cinnamon butter they serve with bread? Either way, it's free, and I'm pretty addicted to it.

I always order chopped salad here. It's so light but fulfilling. I believe they used to serve Tomato Soup here but the last time I checked, they didn't have it :( Should I try lobster bisque?
Just arrived in Moon Township and came across this place while leisurely touring the area. First of all, as a meteorologist, I've gotta say this is the best named restaurant EVER!! I had to stop! I ordered the Pad See You (more commonly spelled Ew), which is a wide noodle, with bean sprouts, broccoli, scallions with your choice of meat. I ordered it with beef. Also ordered some jasmine rice. Although my bill set me back $12 (a bit pricey, especially nearly $3 for white rice), the order was large and delicious with a kick of spice. The rice was perfectly sticky. Service was excellent as my waiter came over at least a half dozen times. Will definitely come back, but given it was a Saturday I think the pricing needs to be a bit more competitive compared to all the other restaurants in the Giant Eagle district (about $1-$2 too high for most items). For those of you with dates, they have two "date booths" which look like futuristic Jetson-esque rooms built into the corners of the dining area. GREAT idea. They also have a large selection of Boba Tea and several Chinese options as well.
This is a strip mall east of the strip on S Maryland. It is a Starbuck's what can you say? I bought $30 gift card for a door prize. That was pretty easy to do, and probably well liked by its recipient.

There is a grungy element that hangs out from time to time around here. This is the side of Las Vegas you weekend on the Strip in the Show\/Spa\/Casino from Cali don't get to see. OF course, you can just go back to California and find it all day, too!
Mind is made up. Way too inconsistent with their service and with their kitchen times. Not worth going there to wonder if you'll get an A or and F. So many other local and reliable bars with attentive staff. This one's a hard no.
Celebrated my girlfriend's 30th birthday here a couple of weeks ago. We reserved a table for 15 and was seated without any issues. As far as service, it was ok but could have been better (not horrible by any means) in order to accommodate everyone timely. This place has a view of downtown like no other place in Charlotte. It's amazing.

As far as dinner, it was ok. I had the short rib which looks really good but was just ok. The Bday girl really enjoyed her meal, which was the grilled salmon, so that's all that matters :)  Others had the pizza too. Fyi, that pizza is really huge lol. Two people can eat on that. From what I heard, they liked it as well. 

After having dinner we lounged, had drinks, and just enjoyed the view. That was the main event and it didn't disappoint.  Nonetheless we had a great time.
*stands* My name is Cressida, and I am a stationery-aholic.

I don't know when the problem started. I think it might have been when I was given some personalised crayons in a Winnie-the-Pooh pencil case on my parents' anniversary when I was four. (I still have the pencil case, y'all.) All I know is that it's a deep, dark, undeniable part of me. Pens. All the pens. Gel pens, fineliners, permanent markers, dry-wipes, biros, cartridge pens, fountain pens - heck, I even stuck a calligraphy nib in a feather I found once. And pencils. Notebooks. Diaries. As I've grown, it's even extended to office furniture and desk layouts. And not always the "pretty stationery" type. I like the really functional stuff too.

Anyway, this is going somewhere. Where this is going is that I really like Ryman. This branch, in particular, is something of a joy. The staff are a delight and I'm pretty sure that's not just because they now recognise me. And once, when I went in just before closing, I heard one of the girls working there say to a colleague, "It's that time of day when the wanderers come in."

"I'm a wanderer," I answered. "But I'm wandering in search of clipboards. Have you any...?"

She pointed me to the correct shelf immediately, and I think perhaps some bats down in Leith might have heard me when I spotted the teeniest, tiniest clipboard of all time. I snatched it up and, hugging it close to my chest, trotted gleefully to the counter, where the gentleman service was the same one as usual.

"Hullo," he said. "Just that for you, today?"
"YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD THE NOISE SHE MADE WHEN SHE SAW IT!" called the girl from the other end of the shop.

It's that kind of place, you know?
High end Italian food, in an unassuming tratorria style hideaway.  You'll feel at home whether in jeans or business casual.

The korean born, italian trained chef, was totally hands on; from the welcome, right through to the finish. 

We had the five course prix fixe meal for two; which for $45\/person, had an abundance of choices and substance to tease the tastbuds and satiate our appetites.

Recommend you check it out, before word of mouth makes desireable reservations difficult to obtain.
Average average average. Only decent for AYCE. Just like every other average AYCE place, they WILL forget your order or even mix them up. We ordered beef and got squid tentacles instead (we ate it out of shock still but hmm). Also limited menu for lunch. 

Sushi is not fresh, but will get you full nonetheless.
Come to Happy Hour and get the lobster grilled cheese with fries!  The prominent lobster chunks have a refreshing lemony taste that cuts the grease and richness of the cheese.  The super buttery and crispy crustless sandwich is served on top of a small cup of fries.  The fries themselves were also great, and had a sweet sugary taste complimenting their saltiness.

Only thing really keeping them from 5 stars: My water was refilled only once, and it was dry most of the time.

Their sound kept going in and out for some strange reason.  I didn't mind it mostly being off as I don't care much for loud environments.

For $9, I was happy with the food.  If they can either use larger water glasses or refill more often, I'd be a happy diner.  As long as a rowdy sports game isn't going on.
Have you seen all my photos yet of Five50 food? Delicious!!!! try not to lick the photos! 550 Degrees for the oven temperature for the best pizzas! Come get some!
Why is there ALWAYS a freakin' line out the door? Don't you think they could figure out that having 1 customer service agent during a peak time is a bad idea?! It doesn't help that everyone that works here seems to hate their job... *Le sigh*

Pro tip: If you only need to ship an item, print shipping labels at home or use the machine out front. Save yourself some headache.
Sam is doing an awesome job with the car stereo, thanks so much buddy for the suggestions and the work !!
Came here a few times already and they haven't disappointed me yet. The chicken is always fresh, very crispy, and the pieces are massive. It's not as cheap as the specials at Popeyes but it does taste a lot better. Love this place and I hope their consistency in quality continues as this is my only go-to fried chicken place right now.
Where did this place come from?  It's in a strange location but it's a small, neat space.  On a Friday evening at 6:30pm our group of 6 was able to be seated no problem.  Having never been here before, our group was ready for a beer.  Say what?!?!  No alcohol?!?!  What's pizza without a cold beer?  Anyway.  

I started with the garlic bread sticks and the house salad with spinach.  Both were above average and delicious!  I was practically licking the bottom of the salad bowl and my husband definitely stole a 3rd bread stick.  

On to the pizza.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to read the trusted Yelp reviews prior and was therefore surprised by the somewhat sweet sauce.  It was okay....but I'm not a fan.  The "Lil" Sicilian cheese pizza I got was the perfect size (I did have a salad and bread sticks prior thought!).  

Service was good - no complaints.  I think they deliver - so maybe next time we're at Sleepy Dog brewery we can call them up and enjoy some pizza with our beer!
CONSISTENCY. That's what I love most about Postino. Everything you order always has the same taste and freshness that you can count on. Their soup is never 'off' and their bruschetta (especially the gluten free) is always on point regardless of the combination. We always start with the olives, and they have so much diversity and flavor in the bowl. Perfect for snacking while enjoying your glass of wine. The kids meals all come with wikisticks for stimulating their little creative minds and encouraging fine motor skill development. Man! What more could I say about a place THIS thoughtful. Even their bathrooms are a place worth checking out. Lots of eclectic decor and the music is very hip. I shazzam a song at least once every time I dine here.
I adopted a really skinny little pitbull mix girl, not too long ago. I came with my dog and as soon as I walked in I was greeted by a male staff who immediately walked me to the computer in order to identify the dog I wanted to see. It was one puppy off of a 6 puppies litter, he was already with a family so the man who was assisting me asked me if I wanted to see any other dog and patiently brought almost one by one the puppies from the same litter and allowed me to spend time with them and watch their interaction with my dog. I fell in love as soon as he brought me the last one I met, the one I adopted and after a while playing with her, when I looked around I realized I was the only person who was still there meeting a dog and still everybody was very courteous and helpful. 
The adoption process is detailed but yet simple, they will make you questions to ensure everything is OK and that you're aware of all responsibilities and possibilities. The fee is not really high and they provide you with a started kit, with discounts for food packages and free things like a tag, which really helps!
Also if you have any other doubts after the adoption they're still very helpful.
What a great experience!  Book way in advance (they claim they're now booking 1-2 months in advance).  It took a little more than an hour, as our guide was very knowledgeable and happy to answer all our questions and discuss tangential history as it came up.  It's also interesting to see how the signs worked.

Love it, love it, love it.
I usually upload a pic or two whenever I post a review on yelp because "picture can describe 1000 words"... Right ? Well, no... Not this place. You just have to come in to find out yourself because those pics I took would not do justice to zen's "amazingness". 

My recommendation : shrimp curry or curry udon. Level 5 is pretty spicy already and I have high tolerance for spicy food
Wow!  I spotted these large, gorgeous cupcakes from a mile away at the Yelp event and just knew I had to grab one before I left.  The presentation was amazing, with 4 different flavors available and plenty of staff to keep things stocked.  

At 8:45pm they still had plenty to go around, so I happily grabbed a chocolate.  Too stuffed to eat it even when I got home, I stored it in the fridge til later.  Tonight, 24 hours later, I got it out of the fridge and it was soooo delicious.  And the creamy chocolatey filling?  What a surprise!  It was tough to eat, but once I got a plate and a fork and stopped trying to wrap my mouth around it I was happy as can be.  

I'll definitely be giving these as gifts sometime soon!
NoDa is a solid brewery in Charlotte. Their beers are tasty and they have tons of neat small batches. They opened a larger brewery site on North Tyron but this location is still operating as a tap room.
Not sure why the GPS takes you to an RV dealer, but head a few blocks to 85th street and  N. W. Grand Ave...you will find it on the corner. One of the best of not the best donut I've ever had. Nothing fancy, but if you like glazed donuts and are in the area, definitely check them out!
Get your tickets online in advance. Good seats go quick. I bring my little movie blanket, keeps me warm and comfy. This place is as good as it gets, I wish it's like the ones in San Diego where you have a server that waits on you and seats are by two people, not in a row. The food for these theaters are actually really good. 

So I am hoping this will upgrade on the food service.
I would give them a negative review I could.  Good luck trying to get anything done on a weekend. My Internet will go from 18 gigabytes so to 3 gig.  Don't get CenturyLink they are worse then Cox
After walking down the row of restaurants for literately 30 minutes, my bf and I decided to grab a quick dinner at Gabby's since it was one of the only non-Italian restaurants offered. We were in the mood for some good bar food and this was just the place. We had the cheesy garlic bread, chili thai wings, sweet potato fries, fries with cheese and gravy, and burgers. Yes, I know what you are thinking, how can two people eat soooo much food. Don't worry, we didn't disappoint you, we ate everything and everything was delicious! I especially liked the chili thai wings. But don't be fooled, we rolled out of there once we were done, but it was worth it :-)
If you are in The Strip, you have a plethora of grocery options at your fingertips. Marty's Market would be my last choice because they only have a small selection of random things, and a lot of empty space. They do not specialize in anything in particular (except maybe overpriced "health foods") and they have less vegan and\/or local foods than one would expect from this type of store. I most recently stopped in hoping for some fresh baked goods, but they do not have a bakery or sell local baked goods, except bread. Even the in-store coffee shop did not have any of the usual accompaniments (you know, muffins, cookies, scones etc.). So with all the other coffee shops and specialty markets around, I don't see how Marty's adds anything special to the area. The customer service seems to be great but that's not enough for me to waste my time looking at the typical packaged natural food items here when I could be finding unique buys at other nearby retailers.
The decor is not for everybody, I call it Jetson's meet Ian Schrager. Very convenient location for access to Scottsdale or Phoenix. I often walk to the local restaurants that I like (no DUI or photo ticket issues), Trader Vics is just next door if you are into that. Rooms are very roomy and clean. Spa and work out area are great. Very airy with adequate equipment. They run occasional specials for Spa treatments which I have taken advantage of making it very reasonable. Not crazy about the pool area but it is OK and haven't eaten at the hotel restaurant despite staying here several times. FWIW, I prefer the Valley Ho to the near by Kimpton which Yelpers seem to love (The Fire Sky).
In this economy, I've grown to be a fan of never paying full price.  Hence my visits to Arizona Mills.  I made the mistake long ago of exploring the whole outlet mall, and it made me feel gross.  The crowds, the stores......ick.  But I did find a diamond in the rough.  

I'm in love with Saks Off Fifth.  It's the best outlet store EVER!  Never buy a full price pair of True Religion, Seven for All Mankind or Joe's Jeans ever again (and they have a couple other brands but those are my fav) - go here and get them for right around $100.00!!  They also have a good selection of dresses, tops, and casual stuff like Juicy Couture as well as designer shoes and sunglasses.   Now I'm the type of person that absolutely hates digging through racks of clothing at Marshall's or even Nordstrom Rack, and it is nothing like that here.  The jeans are folded neatly by brand, and everything is well organized and clean.  Even the dressing rooms!  There's a great selection of designer men's clothing as well.  

Also, get on their mailing list because I frequently get an extra 20% off purchases.
BAD BUSINESS!  I usually don't do this (blast people), but this I just can't let slide.  This company agreed to be a part of my Spring Fling Fundraiser a month before the event, no questions asked.  When it came down to the last day (literally 5 hours before the event), they wanted a guarantee from me that they would make $250 in sales.  I reiterated this was a fundraising event, and I could make no guarantees on their sales.  I told them I hoped they would still come since I had been promoting their business for over a month and if they had any losses, the best I could do would be to write them a tax deductible receipt for those.  And no shit, now with 4 hours left until the event, they don't even take the common courtesy to respond to that email.  That is not the way you gain customers. That is not the way you do business.  Your reputation should be your bond.  So disappointed because to love to support local businesses. That was a pretty shady way to duck out and I hope karma catches up.  We should work together in a community to support each others endeavors wether it be charitable or business. You never know the next time you need someone to scratch YOUR back... but maybe they'll just be behind you with a sharp object instead.
Greek food that will male your mouth water. This place is a jewel, beautifully decorated the servers are warm and friendly. They will explain the menu and some favorite choices if its your first time. I kept it somple and had a wrap. I wish i had talen a picture of it. But i just couldnt put it down. 
Plus is a family owned and operated. 

At the end of our meal the manager came over and thanked us for trying them out and made sure we have a good visit. Talk about a great first impression.
Went in today for lunch and was told there would be a wait which I was ok with, but after i waited a long while I asked how much longer it would be and was told it was gonna be a little while longer cause they only had one stove working. It was ridiculous how long I had to wait and I barely even had enough time to taste it before I had to be back at work.
We had a horrible experience with this company several years ago.  So bad that I tell people about it still.  The line from our house to the sewer was backed up because of tree roots from a neighbor's tree.  South Side thought they could just snake it and fix the problem.  When they broke the snake in the line (which we were later told by other plumbers was a HORRIBLE idea), the insisted it was our fault and wanted to bill us in the neighborhood of 10K to dig up our driveway and repair the damage.  We ended up paying someone else around 6K to do the job.  Unbelievable.  And they were rude and unresponsive to boot.
Snooze is one of my top breakfast & brunch joints!

Wait time can be anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, so show up early or plan to wait! Once you're finally seated service is prompt and courteous. A manager occasionally walks around to make sure all patrons are satisfied and I like that.

I would describe Snooze as having a creative menu. They have an "ahh la carte" section for those that can't ever make up their mind about something and want to pick individual items (try the pancakes!). As a bloody mary fan, I have to say that this place has a  mean bloody mary! 

Snooze has a very good breakfast sandwich that comes on a pretzel bun and it's just so good. 

The restaurant has a very interesting interior design that has a very trendy hipster feel. I will say that the seating here can be a little intimidating at first. They have booths that seat a total of four people but they are sectioned off to sit a total of two people. It almost feels like you're sharing a booth with someone else with a small divider in the middle, but don't worry, it feels normal quickly. 

Snooze is definitely a local favorite for a lot of people, so don't pass it up!
Wanted to grab some cupcakes for a family members birthday and noticed that Sassy's had a little more variety than other places around. They did not disappoint. Stopped in for the cupcakes, stayed for bacon, eggs and toast (with purchased cupcakes awaiting me in the cooler) They were a big hit!
Love this comedy club- not a fan of their 2 drink minimum but glad there isn't a $$ minimum per table. It's is always PACKED when we go...just a testament that they have performers that are funny as f*%#&!!!!! ;) 

Even the "opening acts" have all been awesome!!!
I love Chick-Fil-A. Just wanted to get that out there. I love their grilled chicken sandwich, which is what I always order. Their lemonade is also good. I used to get the little chicken nuggets and have always liked them as well. So to review, Chick-Fil-A is awesome. Their staff is always very kind and provide superior customer service. I am a major fan.
Loved the one down in Chandler~ came here with a group of 20 friends for a friendly game of dodge ball.
Staff was friendly, the facility seemed new and of course, I had a good time~ hard not to have a good time when there's jumping and dodging involved.
The only slight improvement could be the ventilation system as the first smell that greeted me made me feel like I had walked into a men's locker room after a heated basketball game . . . hate to write this, but the place smelled a little like old socks or smelly feet . . . the good news is that after you've been there a while, you stop noticing the smell.  
So maybe the trick is to circulate some air fresher through the vents by the door??
I love the concept, the fun so this is just a little suggestion . . .
Le comptoir de Marmite Su'l Feu est ouvert de mai à octobre au Marché Atwater, dans le côté Nord où se retrouvent toutes les cantines extérieures. 

J'adore la diversité et la qualité de la nourriture de ce coin- on peut y siroter une bière et déguster un laksa singapourien, une soupe pho ou une variété de charcuteries. C'est animé! On peut reconnaître ce restaurant par les nombreuses casseroles imposantes en fonte qui s'enlignent devant les clients et par les odeurs parfumées qui émanent de celles-ci. La cuisine de l'île de La Réunion est influencée par ses racines indiennes, chinoises, africaines... Imaginez des viandes tendres enrobées  par une sauce cari accompagnées de rougail, ce à-côté composé de tomates coupés en dés, petits piments et gingembre en quantité industrielle. Pour 13,50$ on a eu droit à un plat de riz, lentilles et viande au choix. J'ai adoré le lapin braisé- si j'avais une grand-mère réunionnaise j'aimerais imaginer qu'elle m'aurait cuisiné ce plat. Et pour les amateurs d'épices il ne faut pas rater leur sauce épicée maison! Hyper relevé et goûteux. 

J'aime beaucoup le concept et j'y retourne dès que possible!
This version of the Green Mermaid is in the Albertson strip mall, nestled in the labyrinth of side roads just off West Sahara avenue, high on the hill overlooking Las Vegas. 

It's a different , presumably newer store design. There are none of those cone-shaped, tortoise shell colored hanging lamps over the barrista bar.
No oval shaped drink pick-up platform. It has a more straight-forward, rectangular shaped set of store furnishings, like you would find anywhere in a suburban strip mall. Well, I guess that is what this is.  

Pretty small space, limited parking. A lot of regular customers, greeted with friendly customer service from the staff that recognizes the regulars.

It is sort of cumbersome getting into and out of this place from West Sahara though. If you don't know where it is, you will easily pass by it a couple of times, even with a GPS in your car. 

If you are planning to meet someone here, give yourself extra time, unless you're a regular.
I played music for a private event here, and wow!  The view is amazing, day or night.  It's a small venue, but swanky.  The "secret" elevator to get to it made it feel like I was in on something really neat.  The food was also spot on.  I'm not sure if it was catered or if the Ghostbar staff made it on site, but when I told them I was vegetarian they gave me a proper meal that was delicious.  I'd like to try being on the other side of things and trying out this club not as an extension of the staff...
I have read reviews stating that you'd better Be ready to wait two hours, have all your information handy, and be over prepared with all your paperwork. I arrived checked in and within five minutes I was called. That's absolutely amazing for government office! I spoke with the lady at the window and apparently due to a large amount of Fraud, certain official documents aren't  accepted anymore.  The information online did not reveal this fact to me so I am appreciative that this lady took the time to tell me. So I will have to return after doing some more legwork on my end. I do want to commend this worker for exhausting all avenues of and attempts to try and help me rectify my situation. Wish me luck when I return, hopefully it will be as quick as today's.
Sparkling dancing tastebuds felt like glitter- the Drunken Noodle was heavenly. This is my new favorite Thai place, Thailand including.
Warm and elegant was my first impression as I was greeted and seated.
Our waiter was more than professional, he was personable, engaging, and helpful throughout the evening. The Sommelier was very good at his craft, and we discussed the hilly mosel region). 
I loved the lobster pot pie (but I gave this restaurant only four stars only because the lobster was chewier than squid ...poorly cooked squid)
the waigu beef with seared fois gras was mouthwateringly delicious and perfectly cooked. I could go on and on about the food, but I must get to the desert... German Chocolate Cake, Toasted Coconut Ice Cream, Candied Walnuts and Root Beer Float with Sassafras Ice Cream, Warm Chocolate Chip Nut Cookies. 
The wine pairings were right on, from the light grassy chablis to the rich full bodied bouredeaux.
I must say though, that the service at Michael Mina put  the service at Joel Robichon's to shame  (they were horribly snooty... AMAZING FOOD and awful waiters).
About $420.00 for the two of us and well spent. A delightful relaxed evening!
I'm staying at Caesar's Palace for 4th of July weekend and today was my very first time visiting the long anticipated Bacchanal Buffet. I have to admit, with all the hype and 5 star positive reviews I have heard of this buffet (from friends, peers and other reviews) there was a heck of a lot to live up to. The result? Two thumbs up of approval. Absolutely AMAZING.
Upon entrance, I was blown away by the decor. Stunning. The restaurant utilizes glassware for much of their decor, which made for contemporary, yet comfortable ambiance, garnished with an array of the most appetizing dishes I have ever seen at a buffet - and I have been to many around the USA, especially buffets in Las Vegas.
I sampled everything. Starting with the Chinese food to the Mexican Sope (stuffed with zucchini flower and cheese) these were incredible - I could have eaten THREE. Next was the Wagyu Beef, Brisket, and the Suckling Pig - not fatty, full of meat, skin was cripsy - perfectly done and the chef on the meat station was a hoot! Ended the meal with an awesome selection of desserts. The dessert station - my favorite - where do I even begin? (salivate salivate) Most of the buffets in Vegas I've eaten at are overly sweet and taste like they've come out of a box. The desserts here are spot on. Gelato and Ice Cream selection is excellent. Some of the best ice creams I have ever tasted - lemon basil sorbet- heart heart. Rice pudding was refreshing and tart. The coconut macroons, Good Lord. For the holiday weekend they even decorated some of the desserts with little flags - super patriotic and thoughtful.
Overall, I give this buffet 5 stars, A+++. Service was spot on as well, Super attentive. 
Great attention to detail. 
If you want a great meal, great dessert, and great service hit the Bacchanal. My only gripe was that the wait was long to get in, but 100% worth it.
Still the best daycare\/boarding facility for dogs in the Valley. We love Dog Days and trust them completely with our pooch!
This year, the Red Rock Company eliminated the Quarterman and only offered the Half Ironman distance.  Worked for me!  This was my first SOMA event, my 3rd or 4th event put on by the Red Rock Company, and my 5th triathlon this year - woot! woot!  Now, I love the SkirtChasers event they do but this one wasn't a 5-star experience.  

A half ironman distance is a 1.2 mile swim, 56 mile bike ride, and 13.1 mile run.  It started at 6:30am, and my number 7 wave didn't start the swim until closer to 7am.  Therefore, when I finished around 1:00pm it was HOT!!  Some people I saw on the course were struggling.  And in the past, other event organizers made sure there were cold sponges available or at least someone with a hose offering to spray you down.  There was only one sprinkler, and the gatorade was warm.  I would think that keeping athletes cool in 89 degree weather would be a priority.  

Anyway, the volunteers were great and the finish line was great and every thing else was well organized and the negatives would never discourage me from doing another event.  Oh, and the swag was great!  It just would have been a little easier if I was hosed down!
I had a completely disappointing experience on my last visit because of their service. I made reservations over 2 weeks ago for the private room that seats 20 on table. A couple of days prior to my reservation I called to confirm that it was still available which they said it was. When I arrived, they forgot about my reservation and tried to make excuses that they do not take reservations. We pointed out our reservations on the list and advised that we have booked the room before. I am giving them 2 stars because the food was still good.
Having recently moved to the Tempe area, I've been trying to find my go-to Thai place. To me, this place isn't as good at Thai Elephant. The service wasn't great and the food was okay but not amazing.

I arrived around 2:00pm to try the lunch menu and the place wasn't very busy; yet the two servers weren't very friendly or welcoming. I've never had Thai Iced Coffee (only Thai Iced tea) so when I saw it on the menu I asked if I could try a small sample of it to see if I liked it. The server said no they don't allow samples, which I thought was kind of rude. Later, she gave me a hard time when I asked to add a little more tea into my Thai Iced Tea because it was way too sweet.

The complimentary soup was very sweet and had an unusual but pleasant flavor. Presentation of the food was nice and portions were descent. I ordered the red curry lunch special and the abundance of vegetables in the dish were nice. The curry itself was flavorful but not groundbreaking. I think my favorite part of the meal was the complimentary egg roll which was crunch and flavorful. 

The food here was good but not great, and with the lackluster service, I think I'll go back to Thai Elephant before returning here.
Just ate here today for lunch, not too bad $5.50 for two slices and a drink. The pizza was very good, good taste and the crust was really crispy but didn't cut the roof of your mouth, I like that. The place was also really clean, not too large but most people just grab and go. The staff was also very friendly and made sure to say hi and thank them for coming in to everybody.
Believe me, their food is great. But the customer service is beyond horrendous. I thought I was getting Fast-Food, not a Dine-in service. It took them 30 minutes to even order my food, and I wasnt even gonna order much to begin with.
I love their food, but they need to fix their time management.
Cause I've got a Golden Ticket..." Chocolate and non-chocolate lovers alike will love this store. Has old school candy and new candy. Pick your own candy and packaged candy.

They have a wall dedicated to Jelly Belly jellybeans - so many flavors! Price per pound is a bit steep however ($9.99). So I'll either get less than a pound or stick to the prepackaged Jelly Belly.

Overall, I liked it in there. The people were nice also. Got $8 worth of candy which I will feast upon late at night while watching Golden Girls.
Yeah, it's a little overpriced for burgers but it is not out of the norm compared to other joints like this ie; Coal Burger, Modern Burger, etc...

We have eaten here two times. Both times I ordered the Zinburger sub the veggie patty and add truffle aioli. Both times it was great. I will admit our first visit we each ordered a side of fries which was way too much food. One order is enough to split between two people. The milkshakes are stellar and are alone worth the trip to Biltmore.

Definitely expect a wait if you go during the weekend. Other than watching others get to eat before you, I have no complaints. Good service, good food, good restaurant!
If it was possible to give a 0 Star Review they deserve it.

I am in awe someone has not yet died from one of the moldy air conditioning units. I rarely get sick and in less than 30 minutes I was coughing and sneezing.

I had to leave the sliding door open all night to alleviate some of the smell and had a dream a coyote walked into my room.

When you think "smoke tree bungalow" think also of the words "mold", "weirdly placed tvs without remotes", "broken A\/C", "sliding glass doors with minimal curtain covering", and "meth den".
Yum and friendly. We just arrived in Charlotte and stopped here for breakfast. The staff was so friendly. They were fast and attentive. Very hard working. 

The food was excellent. My kids said the best pancakes they've ever had.   I ordered the biscuits and gravy. Very good and at a great price.  The bacon was thick but cooked to perfection.  Everything was tasty. 

Cute general store.   Very charming place and great for people with kids.
The food was absolutely delicious. We tried the fish tacos, the coconut shrimp, the fish and chips and lastly, taro chips. My wife and I took out and the food was ready quickly and boy did we devour it just as fast. You won't be disappointed!
Amazing presentation and service! Will definitely add this to our local favorites! Try the Catfish and Crispy Duck......not to mention their Shrimp Pad Thai.
This is my favorite local bar. $6 wings and $4 beers are my go to! Service is always friendly here but I just wish these guys would hire more people in the kitchen. It's very common for me to come here and be told "there's only 2 guys in the kitchen."

With how busy this place gets, you'd think they would add at least another guy back there. 

Other than that little stitch, Zipps is my go-to after work! Good spot to hangout with friends and spend time. This place keeps my repeat business for good prices and awesome service.
Buffalo Wing...$0.35
Draft Beer...$1.00
Slice of Pizza...$1.00
Grimaldi's during Happy Hour...Priceless
Where do you even start with Sweet Republic. This was also one of the first places I found upon moving to the valley with the help of a flyer I received at an event.  It is quite a drive for me, but *always* worth it.

First things first. The ice cream and sorbets are insanely delicious. No words anyone writes in one of these reviews could possibly accurately describe the goodness of Sweet Republic. However, I would like to quote one of my friends who had their ice cream for the first time at a recent First Friday. After having a couple bites, they looked at me and said, "Now I know why you drive so far to get this. This is the best ice cream I have ever tasted."

The atmosphere there is so fun and uplifting. They have outdoor and indoor seating, games to play (including connect four) and free wifi. The mint and orange creamsicle decor has such a refreshing and comforting feel. 

However, one of my favorite aspects to Sweet Republic is being adventurous. I encourage everyone going to have a try of a few different ones there before deciding on what to get. Also, try something you never thought you would. You'll be pleasantly surprised, because not only will it taste exactly like you imagined, but it will be yummy! The owners put a lot of thought and time into their ice cream and I love tasting the new things they've made and hearing their stories about how sometimes it sounds just as crazy to them and ends up being fantastic. 

Sweet Republic is well worth the trip, no matter where you live in the valley. I don't know one person that has gone and been disappointed.
This is a very clean store. Everything on the shelves are always organized. Everything is easy to find because I noticed that they do not move their product around too often. The meat counters look nice and clean. The fruit and vegetable areas are also clean and well managed.
Perfect place to get gifts for your wife and daughter.
While I have to continue supporting the Sauce by my place, this brand new one right across from AJ's is very nice.  I am sure their spacious patio will be very popular.

The cashier was very friendly.  My food took a little longer than I expected, but to be fair I usually get a panini.  I did appreciate the cashier boxing everything up nicely and asking if I needed napkins and such.

Unfortunately, my "spicy chicken sausage" pizza, which I thought would just have crumbled chicken sausage on it, was blanketed with jalapeños.  I longsufferingly picked off every one of the little green peppers.  After my pizza was properly picked over, it was fine.  Good temperature, nice crust (I got the hand-tossed), decent cheese.  It's not Federal Pizza level but it's very solid, especially as a quicker, cheaper (around $10) to-go option.

My slice of cheesecake was quite good, and a nice medium size...not huge (Cheesecake Factory) but more than a tiny sliver.

I had no problem with parking in the evening.  Other than a rude car picking someone up and blocking the way...please park if you're picking someone up and there are cars behind you!
This is a pretty good burger place, that COULD be a great burger place. It has the potential. This is a chain that I actually first ate at while in Florida. I didn't even know they had made their way to Canada, but we were excited to see it and turned the car around to see how things went here in Canada.

The burgers are good, very large and filling and I like the grilled mushrooms as a topping. Where they fall short: no specialty sauces (just basic mayo) and no combos! This I find very strange. You have to order everything separately. It seems like a little thing to make a combo!

I liked the service though. The woman taking our order told me that only one fry would work or two people and she was right. I appreciated the heads up! But I wish they had some more variety of products.

I'm comparing it to the obvious one: Hero Burger and I guess what I'm saying is, Hero Burger wins! 

BUT if you want a good, basic burger, this is a good choice.

PS - Open containers of peanuts are both kind of gross AND bad for people with allergies. They seem like an unnecessary gimmick.
extensive menu 

The interior is perfection. It's cosy, stylish and the perfect spot to take that one friend who is always on the trend!

I only went in for a dessert and it was lovely that we weren't rushed out by the staff. I tried the dulce de leche cheesecake which as incredible and you have to do it. 

I'd love to go back for lunch and try a sandwich of their extensive menu! Would strongly recommend!
My favorite sandwich spot from Chicago has arrived! My go-to order is a wreck on wheat, skinny cut, everything minus mayo, extra peppers, extra pickles. Grab the orange mango Nantucket Nectar and a oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. 

If the weather is nice dine out in the plaza across the street. The strawberry banana shake is awesome and I love the little butter cookies that accent the straws. 

Definitely stop in and give them a shot!
They did an amazingly awesome job on our blinds!!! We worked with Daniel and he was so helpful and knowledgeable!! We had many quotes for our new house and they were much better then everyone's price by far. They worked in a very timely manner and the quality is fantastic!!
I had today's special from the Global Grill, which was shrimp skewers. It came with grilled corn on the cob, basmati (I believe that was the type) rice, and a stalk of grilled green onion. I used a $2 off coupon, so the total came to $8.99. I must say, this was a good deal. There were six large shrimp grilled to perfection and skewered in groups of three on my plate, along with a generous portion of deliciously seasoned rice--(seasoned I should say with some kind of piquant sauce that made it more than tasty). The corn tasted fresh and was grilled right. The only thing about the downtown location that can be a problem is parking. But I was able to find a free spot on the street near the store today at around 5pm.
Great Chinese and dim sum restaurant - so nice to have in Henderson!  East Ocean is now my go-to place for a pleasant Chinese dining experience.  Previously I did the trek to some of the places near the strip or in China Town.  Now I am Very Happy to have found East Ocean. Everything we have ordered is delicious and the atmosphere is pleasing too.
Delicious gourmet food to be had here!  I had two different dishes - both vegetarian - and I enjoyed them both immensely.  Don't come here if you plan on cramming yourself with as much food as you can eat; rather, come here to enjoy the experience of eating.  The portion sizes are on the smaller size, but all of the tastes are worth savoring.
First time here .. take out type place but I thought the food was a notch above other takeouts. Got the Mongolian beef with lo mein noodles and it was great. Crab rangoons were tasty.. nice folks , i enjoyed the meal..
Bon Jour is a hidden gem of the Las Vegas valley. The pastries are fantastic, as are the breads. Personal fave? The beignets!! But get there early because they disappear quickly. Tucked away behind Starbucks, they are worth the search. I promise, you will NOT be disappointed!! So sayeth the Yelping Doula.
The pizza is ok, but you don't come for that. You come for the experience. 
However, small children and teens may not like it, especially on nights where there's lots of senior citizens since they'll flood the suggestion box with tunes from 40-60 years ago, and kids who were born in the last 20 years will quickly get bored, since they won't recognize any of the songs.
I have been using SHPR for approximately three years to board my two 50-55 lb dogs. I have never had an issue with them until now. Although their prices have steadily increased over the years and most things require additional fees, I have never complained, until now; however, I have questioned whether this place is worth the money that I have spent with them, which is probably well over a couple thousand dollars over the last few years. 

Here is my story: 
My two dogs have always used the Pavilion Patio Suite together. I love that they are able to have out door space, especially when they are kenneled 24x7. Last time we boarded, they were out of the Pavilion Patio Suite, so we took an Elite Patio Suite. This time when I called to book 6 nights, I was told that my dogs were too large to share the Pavilion Patio Suite and MUST be in at least an Elite Suite. I have never had this issue before. I was told that such things must be approved by management and a day later I received a call that management had declined my request, as the dogs would be more comfortable in the Elite Suite. 

I would not have such an issue with this, except that I really feel this is a money issue. The the Elite Suite is actually only 7'X7', while the Patio Pavilion Suite is 2 spaces of  4 1\/2'x7', equaling more space than the Elite Suite. The Elite Suite is even slightly cheaper; however, I made it clear that I really want the outdoor space, therefore, my only option is the Elite Patio Suite, which is $15 more per night ($105 more for my entire trip). Additionally, the website states that the Pavilion Patio Suite is good for dogs up to 100 lbs and my dogs are either at 100 lbs or just over by 5-10 lbs (combined). I think it is completely silly that they are so wrapped up in 5-10 lbs (max) of a difference and they are willing to lose a good customer.

I will state that I feel that ultimately, my issues lie with management, not the individuals who are in non-managment roles. I feel that management is loosing a good customer over a silly issue, and have used their employees to relay a message that really should have come from management, but I am holding firm and have found another place to board my dogs. Additionally, please don't state that you feel this is in the best interest of my dogs, when really this really seems to be about how to get more money out of the customer. 

I have since canceled my reservation and found a new place which will not only be saving me $200, but also allows my dogs to participate in open play all day, rather than being cooped up in a small room\/kennel. Sure my new place doesn't have flat screen TV's that play Animal Planet, but it provides my dogs with all the necessities and a chance to meet and play with other doggie friends without additional costs.
Not quite a 'corporate chain' but getting close. Food was bland with no flavor and unimaginative. There are a plethora of good places to eat in the vicinity so I'm confused as why there was a wait for a table. The whole front lobby is a mess when there's a wait, people checking in, people cashing out and servers trying to get beer. The staff dressed however they wanted and looked rather sloppy.
Very good food!  The sushi and bento were delicious! Good quality and quantity. I will come back for good traditional Japanese food.
We had a tree branch fall on the power lines going into our house last night. We didn't realize the extent of the damage, and our power went out, so when Hydro showed up, they told us we needed an electrician in to repair the connectors before hydro could reattach the wires. 
We called one place before Electrika, and they had no one available to come today, but recommended Electrika. I called them and they gave me a window of 5pm-7pm. Then we got a call saying they would be early. They arrived around 3pm. 
They were on the pricier side, which was expected because it was an emergency, but they were incredibly helpful, gave us a break where they could and did a great job. They called Hydro for us when they were done, and the power was back on shortly after. Expensive accident, but very happy with the service we received on such short notice.
What can you say about the best donut you've ever eater but....... You got it! All the donuts are exceptional but the bread pudding donuts.....are illegal in many states! If you don't believe me try one!
J'ai eu la plus grande   frousse de ma vie  !!! J'étais arrivé en retard   pour la célébration d'un anniversaire d'une amie à moi . En arrivant à la réception  il y avait de  la lumière j'ai fait  commande de  mon plat. Je vois que ma  guide serveuse porte des lunettes spéciale pour pouvoir voir dans le noir (j'en voulais une aussi )  et elle me  demande  de me placer derrière elle et de bien tenir ses épaule.  On forme un train .Elle m'a diriger à ma table .  On peut pas utiliser notre cellulaire . Il faisait vraiment , mais noire même pas de lueur  de lumière ...

Arrivé à mi - chemin de ma table  je suis tombé et je me suis  assise sur une  de mes amie   La serveuse 《 Julie》 m'a bien rediriger vers mon  mon siège . Assise je suis mise à paniquer  . Il faisais trop noire  et  je suffoquais . J'avais chaud ! J'avais peur !  Je voulais partir , mais heureusement que mes  amies étaient amusantes, car ça m' a aidé à me calmer. J'ai  réclamé mon verre de vin rouge et une  verre d'eau. Mes amies m'ont dit de  fermer mes yeux . Le fait de fermer mes    yeux m'a beaucoup aidé et m'a tranquillisé et aussi le fait que mes deux boisons son arrivé ça  m'a aidé  aussi . La nourriture était correct . J'ai préféré mon dessert qui était une crème brûlée .Délicieux ! Quand on  a dû partir mes amies et moi nous devions crier le nom de《Julie》 . Nous avons formé un train . Chaque personne maintenait  fortement les deux épaules de la personne qui la précédait .
The food is solid, but the service is bad.  There was not much of a line, but yet it took sometime just to place our order.  There were plenty of employees working they just seemed to be in no hurry to do anything.  After repeating our order a few times we were confident enough to move on.

The person at the register was friendly, but also lacking motivation.  Once again after repeating our order a few times we paid.  The cashier does think to ask if you need a drink, but does nothing after that.  Every person we saw go through had to ask for their drink when they got their food.

The wait for your food to heat up is fine.  Once again we repeated our order a few times before eventually leaving with everything we ordered.

The food was tasty.  It is not great, but good for its price point.  While the prices are higher, you do get a decent amount for your money.  I had a sausage stromboli.  It had solid flavor.  It seemed quite similar to Sabarro.  I also had a garlic knot.  It was ok.
Its all about the experience! Ask for Kris. She is the best! Don't forget to treat her well if she makes your night.
Here's what I went through:

-My right jaw hurts a lot and my doctor told me to check to a dentist because he\/she probably knows better about dental disease

-Made an appointment for a check-up. Came a bit late because my class ended 15 minutes longer that day. The nurse picked me up and brought me to the chair.

-I told her what my other doctor told me. She did a 10 seconds check and found nothing wrong. Then, proceed to drill my teeth. I asked her why was she drilling my teeth on the same position as my painful jaw and I pointed it to her that I only want a check-up. She said, "Well, the schedule says it's cleaning." I felt weird when she said that, like is she deaf or something. I specifically told her that my jaw hurts. I could taste blood on my mouth and she said that my gum seems to be a BIT sensitive. Of course it's sensitive, my JAW is in PAIN.

-I told her that I didn't want the cleaning because my jaw is in pain. She said, "Well, we might have to freeze you." I asked her what that was and she answered, "Oh you know, shots. Probably a couple shots to numb you." I panicked after that and just kept repeating that I didn't want it.

-She called a female dentist not long after that. The dentist ignored my explanation of my jaw and just called me childish for not wanting the shots. She just went on and on with her bully and verbal abuse. She tried so hard to convince me by saying that she would just clean half of my teeth while at the same time, verbally bullying me. The nurse just sat there, ignoring me. I have no experience with such DISGUSTING ABUSE and just sat there, silently CRYING because of the pain and hope that the nurse finished whatever she was doing to my teeth faster. Obviously, the nurse knew that I was crying because she said, "Hold on, I'll be done soon." After that, she just gave me a free tooth brush and I went home with both my jaw in pain.

-Before this horrible abuse, I had 2 wisdom teeth taken care of. When a male dentist tried to sew my gum, he accidentally sew the gum to my cheek. I can still feel the scar with my tongue.

-Please, please and please avoid this place. They don't care whether they abuse you or not. For them, you are nothing but a bag of money. This place gave me nightmares from the abuse that I had to go through. Whenever I passed by any dentist place, I get a nervous breakdown and cry for no reason.
Gross. The noodles I'm sure were spaghetti. Beyond that, the food tasted awful. This place is horrible. Sad how places like this remain open and other great places close.
I read reviews of various repair shops and dealerships on Yelp and decided to take my Honda Odyssey to Hontech for repair.  It needed the timing belt replaced and a general inspection for overall needed repairs. I dropped it off in the morning and made arrangements to be in contact to authorize repairs. A few hours later I received a call letting me Know what repairs were necessary and that due to the vehicles age and condition, a couple of items broke but needed to be replaced. It was explained to me that these items were broken while trying to access and\/or make the repair. I completely appreciate the honesty and communication.   In addition, they let me know the overall condition of associated parts and whether or not they were serviceable did not need replacement.  After authorizing the repair, the total amount came to exactly what I expected it to be. The dealership quotes were several hundred to $1000 more. I am completely satisfied with the repair Hontech made and will refer all my friends to them for their Japanese import vehicle repairs.
Locally grown yummy food. The philly cheese steak sandwhich with a side of ranch is great. The tea is just right not to strong and not to weak. They are twenty four hours but wont server lunch stuff until after 6am.  The prices are great too.
Camelback Consign and Design rocks!!! The owners are pretty well versed in the antiques and very friendly and personable. I ended up happening across it one day while waiting for a table at Oreganos. I wasn't really looking for anything, but just passing the time.

The employees were so nice without being pushy. As luck would have it, I found a bar that we all agreed would look great in my living room. It wasn't antique but it had a great feel and design to it. I asked the woman at the counter for more information and when she saw the piece I was looking at, lit up. Why? Because there's a hilarious story with this bar, and she was dying to share.

When the person who had owned it previously brought it to the store to be sold they informed her, you know, as a heads up, that it didn't make a very good desk.

I wanted to die. I'm totally picturing this lady prancing about a big furniture store not finding "anything quite right" and a frustrated sales person answering "yes" when she asks if this [bar] will work as a desk. :) And now it's in my living room. 

I also grabbed a great shot glass and holder set that was already on top of it as an accent piece, paid in full that day and was able to leave the bar there for a few days until I could come back and pick it up. They also offer delivery.

The store is very easy to walk through and everything is organized nicely. There is furniture, jewelry, glasses, clocks, portraits.. just everything your little heart desires. They were very helpful when I came to pick up my bar and even helped cover up some of the minor cosmetic flaws that I didn't necessarily care about.

The only issue was that they apparently started to wrap all my shot glasses individually but seemed to have run out of paper. As I got home and was unwrapping them all one by one... I got to the last sheet of paper and to my surprise there were two... but not after one rolled immediately off my counter top and smashed into a bajillion pieces on my tile floor. Not cool folks. I never even got to use it.
Awesome Wings - check.

Amazing coal fired pizza - double check.

Great Service - check.

Needless to say, we love Anthony's! This is our go to when we decide to eat out last minute and have a craving for something filling and familiar. We love the wings, and regardless of the serving sizes, we always each get our own pizza, because who doesn't love left overs?? 

Everytime we've been here we've had a great time, with the exception of the last time. I didn't let it effect my rating or my review, because I know it's not typical, but I still think it's important to mention. We were sitting at a high top table right across from the kitchen area, with servers constantly rushing by and in perfect ear shot of all of their conversations, which I don't normally care about, with the exception of this time. There was one male server who was obviously flustered and irritated, and when he saw he had been given another table, this was his response- "G*d d*mn it, do I not deserve a f*cking break, J*sus Chr*st!" ........... not cool, dude, not cool.  Fortunately he was not our server, or we would have been out the door at that moment. Our server was good (seemingly new, but good), and otherwise we had a good time, but that was a pretty shocking experience. I get that you're tired, but maybe just don't be an immature idiot next time, and be aware of your surroundings. 

ANYYYWAYYY!  That aside, we love eating and drinking here and will continue frequenting! Hopefully that one server doesn't get too many tables again, after all, we wouldn't want him to make too much money off of those pesky paying customers that are such an inconvenience!
Another stop for my bachelorette party.  We were able to make a table reservation (thx GK!) here without having to do bottle service, which was great!  Our group of 8 was shown to our table and immediately served drinks and shots and had a great time.  We were there around 10pm, so it wasn't too busy yet, but we had a good time anyway.  The "stripper" pole on the dance floor provided some good entertainment.  

Always a great place to hit up when in Old Town!
A much welcomed addition to the Indian buffet scene on the west side. This buffet was every bit as good as our favorite places, Tamba and India Palace. You get the usual choices in the buffet: tandoori, tikka masala, saag, veggie korma. The chicken korma was a new one. Piping hot naan and lots of ice in the glass of water which was refilled without having to ask. Never understand why some Indian places serve luke warm water with no ice. Best part is you can have both kheer and gulab jamen for dessert and they were great. Only negative was the TV that was blasting some Bollywood version of Sabado Gigante (idiocy). Anyway, thoroughly enjoyed this food and we will be back!
Quel jolie petit endroit! Réconfortant, calme et chaleureux. Même si je suis arriver 40 minutes avant la fermeture pour y boire un thé dans une journée glaciale, la serveuse m'a très bien accueilli. La carte des thé est très bien expliqué. Je suis tombé sous le charme des petits paragraphe expliquant d'où venait le thé, quel était le monsieur qui le confectionnait, quels types de feuilles étaient utilisé etc etc. J'ai trouvé la carte des sucreries un peu plate. Pas beaucoup de choix et les deux trucs que je voulais manger avec mon ami, il n'y en avait pas. On s'entend qu'on est arrivé 40 minutes avant la fermeture, c'est normal. Bref, c'est sûre et certain que je vais retourner à cet endroit pour lire, date, jaser, ou simplement boire un thé en regardant les gens alentours de moi.
3rd time coming here, no customers at drive through, maybe 6 customers inside. Why do I still wait 15 min for a panini. Girl taking order couldn't understand order or could you even hear her. Everyone looked so busy, but not sure why since there's no one here. Comparing to the other stores with more customers, this place needs to re-traintheir staff.
First of all, let me just say this: do not discount this store in star ratings because they don't have an electronics section, or more non-food items.  It is a NEIGHBORHOOD MARKET.  Do you know what MARKET means?  It means, FOOD.  Drive two more blocks to the Supercenter and stop wasting people's time by saying how crappy this location is because it isn't a Supercenter.  First world crybabies.

I've found most of the cashiers here to be friendly, and will mostly open up to you even if you happen to be friendly first.  This location is two blocks from where I live, is open 24 hours, and carries a great selection of food items, along with a decent toiletries\/makeup section in case you're in a pinch and need those things.  I've never run into anything out of stock.  Most of the times I go, there are workers restocking the shelves, so they stay pretty well on top of that.  It's a clean and relatively uncluttered store, especially considering it's not that large.  If you're in the area and need something at a MARKET, this one is a-ok.
Holy crap.  I had Gaucho for lunch this summer, but it was their food truck.  No offense, GPA...but that food truck isn't necessarily doing you any favors.  Not that it was bad.  It wasn't.  It just wasn't as great as the food I got at the restaurant.  

Which...okay...was great.  Sorry for the spoiler.  Great food.  

No reservations, so there's usually a line, but honestly the wait was no more than probably 5 minutes AT LUNCH.  

I had the special...Gaucho Banh Mi.  It was delicious.  See above.  My date had empanadas that she then shared with me.  Because she's awesome, but we're not rating her...the empanadas...ALSO awesome.  

Every sauce\/condiment was drinkably good (though honestly, i don't recommend that).

The staff was super high energy and friendly.  So if you don't like friendly people this may not be the place for you.  

Cool vibe, great food, great staff.  Five star.  Bang.  Done.
This place reminds of St Lawrence Market in Toronto but more veggies and fruits then seafood.

Fruits and veggies look so good! Too bad we didn't have a kitchen at our hotel room, cause we would have bought and cooked up a storm!!

lots of varieties of apples!
We visited this place with our grandson and had a great time. Lots of playground toys for him to play on.

We enjoyed our time here. My only complaint was that I felt there could have been more trees around the playground area.
Located just a little north of Lawrence. Cozy spot for board games. Saw some people just came here to chill and talk. Their board game selection is pretty exhaustive but almost no duplicates since they're just a small(er) cafe (compared to Snakes & Lattes). Fees are $5 for unlimited hours or $2.5 per hour, unless its a Saturday in which case it'll be $7 for unlimited. Very standard.

Good selection of snacks AND drinks. We ordered the black sesame latte and mango bubble tea and both were surprisingly good. Their grilled cheese wasn't too bad too. All were fairly priced. 

Games are marked up here as expected, not sure why you would even buy games from a board game place ofc it'll be marked up. Go to 401 if you really need to buy Catan.
Great happy hour, great location and good service. The sushi is average but does its job and goes down great with some sake!
I have to go with 2 stars because the food is just terrible. I've yet to try any food I like. The chicken is a ground chicken patty, not grilled chicken, which is gross. The burger I had medium well was charred black and dried out- I attempted this order on two separate visits before giving up. The only edible food I had was the prime rib sandwich and even that was worse than TGI Fridays. The milkshakes deserve about 10 stars but I can't write a fair review on a burger place when the burgers are awful. I don't understand the hype about this place at all EXCEPT with regard to the milkshakes. I've tried a few but s'mores is my favorite!
I came in after I spoke to someone about signing up for a 7 day trial for eos at the eastern location. My cousins go here and the guy I spoke to on the phone about the membership seemed helpful over the phone. I went today and was mocked by the guy in the front, his name is Salvatore. I explained to him I was there for Andrew to sign up for a trial and talk about the different memberships eos offer. As I was explaining he would mumble "mmmhmmm" every 5 seconds even after I was finished talking. He was super rude and sarcastic. Honestly after the third "mmmhmm" I knew I did not want to ever sign up with eos! I let Andrew take me on a tour but after I told him about how rude Salvatore was and I will not be returning. I'd rather pay more at LVAC. I read on another review that they were mocked by the staff and I'm not surprised if it wasn't the rude guy who mocked me. You are suppose to feel welcomed at the gym. I will never go to eos ever again. I wouldn't even stay for a free trial!!! I signed up for lvac again right down the street 10 min later!!
Good food. I had the pork belly. Cheeseburger & gnocchi was ok. Their strawberry shortcake was not great. If you live in the area its a great place to eat. I would not make the drive again.
This place manages to stay pretty under the radar even though it wins awards left and right in local publications.  The reason I would guess is because it is situated right in downtown Guadalupe.  If you are not sure what Guadalupe is, it is a small community  founded by Yaqui Indians that incorporated their own town right in the middle of Tempe and Phoenix.  The town is now mainly Native American and Hispanic and is about one square mile in size.

The Farmer's Market has an amazing assortment of super fresh produce and they even make their own honey.  Right inside the door you can see some live bees hard at work making the delicious varieties.  Because this market is in an area with a lot of Hispanic residents they carry a large selection of Peppers fresh and dried.  They get a lot of their produce from local farmers and offer some organic choices.

I know some people who are intimidated about going here because they fear the neighborhood it is in is 'different' than their stucco and chicken wire Stepford neighborhoods,  but I have never had a problem going here day or night.

One thing to be cautious of is the fact that this town's speed limit is 25 MPH everywhere and you better observe it.  For one thing there are a lot of dogs and people crossing the street all over the place so the slow speed is safest for everyone.  Also, Guadalupe has their own police and they will not hesitate to pull you over because you think 25 is just too slow.
Kept getting followed around and asked if we were done looking or if we were ready. When we were finally done we got our 2 pairs of shoes and showed a coupon at the register and she was rude about not taking saying it didn't exist and where u got it from, instead of saying "hey you know what, that won't work but I have one that will" like a good customer service rep should do instead of saying no to the coupon and no to having any coupons available. Made us return our shoes with that attitude. Last time we go there
Depuis un bout, je fais la tournée des magasins en vrac à Montréal et aujourd'hui j'ai découvert Vrac et Bocaux. Le local a un look un peu scandinave: blanc, très propre et aéré, à l'opposé de disons, PA où on magasine le bokchoy le plus frais en étant serrés comme des sardines (néanmoins j'adore cette épicerie!). Le concept est simple et très environmentally-friendly: on y trouve des épices, des huiles, des noix, des savons, etc en vrac, donc sans emballage en plastique! On apporte nos propres contenants ou on peut acheter des pots masons de toutes tailles au magasin et on remplit! Il y a beaucoup de choix intéressants comme du fromage en grains, du fromage à la crème de cajous, du kombucha Luxia fait au Québec, du tempeh enveloppé dans des feuilles de bananier, et la majorité des produits est bio. Tu sors de là heureuse et fière d'avoir réduit la quantité d'emballages inutiles sur la planète!
Let me start with saying that the sushi here was wonderful! That's the only reason it gets four stars. You could tell the wait staff was working their butts off but there were definitely NOT enough of them. We sat at the sushi bar as there were no tables available. A waitress took our drink orders and we asked for a regular dinner menu as one of us was not eating sushi. Not once did anyone come back to take the order, refill drinks etc. Phone was ringing off the hook with no one answering. We will definitely eat here again but might just get food to go. I've worked in the F&B industry for years so I understand how crazy things can get but they definitely need a manager, hostess and maybe a busser or two to help with the dinner rush. Doesn't seem like they are handling the expansion very well.
Quality Quality Quality! These items last a lifetime, worth every cent. Steer clear of the Factory outlet. Very knowledgable staff about the products and even gave me a history lesson behind this iconic brand, thank you!
One of my favorite spots to shop and usually great staff but yesterday I had a tiff with one of the staff members! 
Was at the register and while the girl was ringing up the bill I asked politely what the content of the sweater was, stone cold she looks at me and replies, holding the sweater in her hand "I don't know"! I asked if she could please look at the content in the inside of the sweater she was holding, frustrated with attitude directed at someone who had killed your mother, she answers she can't see that small! Not the greatest job for this young girl, Kayla! She should not work in the public if clients seem to be bothering her with question! As it goes, we noticed the gentlemen behind us had an issue as well because he spoke to the manager immediately after we did! H&M, do yourself a favor and relieve her of her misery, she belongs in an office with no client contact whatsoever! My little beef! Cheers
BEAN BAGS. Dirty bean bags? OK place to hang out. Sub par food + food selection.
Je suis aller que pour le club cette fois là. Même si je suis un peu vieille pour clubber, j'ai adoré cet endroit. Les gens sont beaux, l'ambiance est belle, la musique est super aussi. Super bel endroit et magnifique terrasse. C'est sûre et certain que j'y retourne pour un 5@7 au courant de l'été. Ils offrent aussi de la nourriture..que je vais sûrement essayer éventuellement. Attendez vous à payer un verre aussi simple qu'un Cuba Libre à 11$..mais bon cela attire une autre type de clientèle :D
I really want to give this place four stars. Greg would string me up by my toenails and make me repent for my burger sins if he knew I was reviewing his favorite place as just a three star burger joint. But I can't abide paying ten to twelve bucks for a fast food burger, fries and a drink. That's crazy cakes. 

Granted the burger is juicy perfection, grilled to order with as many custom toppings as your hardening arteries can handle. They have two in particular that get me salivating every time: grilled mushrooms and onions. That alone should warrant a fourth star, especially since they don't cost an extra couple bucks a pop like most places. But it's still a six freakin' dollar burger. If they hadn't plastered their walls with newspaper reviews exalting how cheap their eats were, I would probably be a bit more accommodating, but more than ten bucks for a fast foodie burger meal just ain't on.

I do also like that they offer a mini version of their two patty big madre burger, for the wimps like me out there. Regardless, I would recommend keeping the foil around your burger and peeling it away like the burritos from Chipoodle. This will guarantee that all those slippery little grilled mushroom and onion tidbits stay in place, because they're seriously too good to get away. 

The french fries are also in the style that I like, freshly fried up with the bejeezus salted out of them. Ten billion times better than the fresh but somehow still super bland and lifeless matchsticks that In & Out serves. The Cajun style fries are just sprinkled with seasoned salt. A bit of a let down from what I was expecting but a nice change in pace since it's usually curly fries that get the seasoned salt treatment. Also if you're a limey barstard like me you can grab a bottle of malt vinegar from the side counter and use it to drown your fries. So good.

I also dig on the free peanuts. I realize this is a polarizing issue considering the risk of nut allergies out there, but I like it. When I was a kid I used to judge the caliber of an establishment by whether or not I could throw peanut shells on the ground. Sadly, that has changed very little with the years because I still get a kick out of doing it. 

Alright. I've talked myself into it. It's getting an extra star. Damn your scrumptious fare, Five Guys. Your hypnotic grease has me entranced.
First time at this location. 
After bouncing around different sales associates, Stephen helped me out tremendously. He helped us find just the right iPhone case, info about replacing the the series two watch, and other products. He is very knowledgeable about his products and provided awesome customer service.  We will be back.
Went for my 6 month cleaning. Easy as pie. In and out.
This became my absolute favorite sushi place when I moved in to Toronto in 2004. However, unfortunately, it became too popular for its own good. Longer line ups, grumpier waitresses and lesser fish quality.
Still a good spot for sushi cravings though, at a very decent price and a perfect location!
This store could get me into some trouble with my husband!  I'm definitely a workout-a-holic and have always felt that cute workout clothes will help you get out the door and in the gym lookin' good!  

I checked out this Biltmore location, and upon entering I was in LOOVE!  Lots of great stuff in great colors.  I was definitely happy to see clothing not only for yoga, but for running as well.  

Staff were helpful without being overbearing.  I was able to find some great crop pants and a zip up for to and from the gym.  Of course, the prices are outraaaaagous but I've found that my high quality work out clothing lasts a lot longer than anything from Target.  Plus, this work out wear will keep me looking great beyond the gym too!  

Now, if only I could justify this to my husband......!
If you care about your car, you'll make the effort to head to Los Olivos Hand Car Wash. I'm pretty particular and careful about the care of my car. So much so, that in the past, unless I need it waxed or detailed, I usually washed and vacuumed myself. 

Now, I find myself still sneaking in for a little TLC at Los Olivos though, when I am too lazy to do it myself. The staff is super nice and very helpful with letting you know about what they offer and any specials without being pushy in any way. They even have a punch card and eventually you get a free wash. Pretty dandy eh? 

The waiting area isn't top notch, but it's a car wash people. It does have a small shop with sodas, snacks, gift cards, random misc car items and some chairs to sit and wait. Supposedly there's a shoe shiner, but I'm still waiting for the day we're there at the same time. Additionally, Giant Coffee is just a hop, skip and a jump away, and that's usually where I am while I wait.

I've been a loyal customer for awhile now, and this past weekend, realized it was time to get the interior of the car detailed again. They did a spectacular job which prompted my need to review. I ordered the mini detail which does a full job inside and a wash and buff\/wax outside. The four hours was so worth it. They even offered to give me a ride home if I really needed, but I had prepared. My trusty laptop and I did some coworking over at Giant all afternoon. And when I was called that she was ready to do, I was in no way expecting to see my car look as new as she did over 5 years ago. I'm still in awe. Ever since, I've been showing her off, and it feels like I'm in a brand new car all over again. The paint is shiny and new, the inside was cleaned from top to bottom (even the ceilings) and the detail in the dashboard and console is incredible. I had already decided to never go anywhere else, but now I think I'll be getting it detailed much more often.

You will not be disappointed. I love this place.
I love the selections of fresh pastries they made .. I love the green tea cake  I bought the tiramisu cake it was worth of my money spend even tho it's quite small but it's whatever to me ..  I would come back try some more
Ce coiffer pour pas cher ça vaut le coup! Service professionel, amical et courtois! À essayer!
I shop here on a regular basis.

I don't know what a store would have to do to get a 5 star rating out of me. After all grocery shopping is not one of my favorite things to do.

I guess as far as grocery shopping goes this place is as good as any other.
Counter boy was friendly.  Portion size was decent.  I appreciated that the toppings included mochi and Andes mint chocolate chips, but both sadly tasted a little stale (probably from being kept chilled and\/or out too long).
This place is a healthy alternative to fast food Mexican food places. They have good fish tacos too. The one reason I come here is that they don't put lard in any of their food. The pinto beans and black beans are vegetarian. I would recommend this place over any other fast food Mexican restaurant.
Looking for an early breakfast place and needed to have some smoked meat before i left Montreal.  Perfect combo of eggs with smoked meat, rye, home fries and fruit. Very tasty and reasonable!
I am a teacher and this is where we go to rent our lights and other equipement we need, from time to time, for school events. I have rented from them before, but never gone to actually pick things up before. I found the staff friendly, knowledgeable and their prices reasonable.
My only criticism would be that the area for renting equipment is small and shabby and they (for some unknown reason) had to get our rental approved by management, I guess because we're a school, even though we're in the system and have rented many times before. We had to wait to get in touch with someone on the phone. It was annoying and seemed unnecessary. Obviously it's some weird policy, so I don't blame the workers or anything.

Returning was nice and quick!
Best donuts anywhere. Krispy Kreme has nothing on this place.
This place is freakin' amazing. Consider that you are in Cleveland, Ohio--then close your eyes and imagine that you have been transported to a hip, clean, gorgeous beach somewhere off the coast of Highway 1 in California. 

This is a restaurant you would encounter on that stretch of highway. This is worth paying for. 

I love the sandwich they have here and get it whenever I can. It features toasted coconut, avocado and other delicious vegan toppings served on lovely fresh toasted bread. The cashew mylk with lavender is my favorite drink so far. I went in today looking for carrot juice. They had a delicious offering of carrot\/beet\/pineapple\/ginger\/red pepper cold-press raw juice. It was awesome. It was not cheap. It was totally worth it.
This place is really good! The best restaurant in the area! The food there is really tasty - especially the Ahi Tuna Club sandwich, Lobster Ravioli and the tandoori chicken flat bread.

They also have mock chicken for those who are vegetarians.

Gorgeous patio for the summer time.
I liked the name probably the most.  There was nothing that stuck out in my mind as 'bad'.  There was nothing that stuck out in my mind as 'great'.  It was good.  

The waitress was a bit new but she was fine.  
The food was fine.  
The seating was...was fine.  

I surprised that the interior looked a bit more dated\/shabby than I thought it could for a place that opened four years ago.  

Good place to stop and grab an app and a beer before a game or something; a stop along the way, but not a destination.

That said...I didn't stay for the band.  Staying for the band might have made more of a positive impression.  If live music is your jam, then maybe decent food is all you really need because you're in it for the ear candy.  

Not a place I'm likely to return to, but only because there's so much competition and so many places to try and I'm not in the Northside much unless I'm heading to a game.
My husband and I tried Liu Liu's in Baxter Village last night, with his parents. The four of us ordered steamed dumplings and four entrees. My husband had a coupon to get one entree free with the purchase of another entree of greater value, so we used that coupon last night.

We arrived just after 5. Our dumplings were good, but the entrees weren't anything special. After we received our dinner, service began to slow down considerably, even though the restaurant was nearly empty. We were sat in the farthest corner on the left as you come into the restaurant, and no one ventured far enough back to check on us.

As a result, we had to flag someone down to get the check. We put down two credit cards and our coupon, to split the check evenly. After waiting for them to get our cards for well over 10 minutes we had to flag them down again. The woman took our cards to process them. She came back a short while later, dropped off our slips and left quickly.

We soon found out why: she had *handwritten* out the tip and totals on the credit card slips! She had written in a 25% gratuity on each slip and totaled it up, leaving it for us to sign, and left without any explanation. This was outrageous. Nowhere on the menu or anywhere else did we see that having a party of 4, splitting a bill across 2 credit cards, or using a coupon would result in us being forced to leave a 25% gratuity!

The service didn't warrant a 25% gratuity and we found this behavior extremely unprofessional. We will not visit this restaurant again and I would warn others away too unless you want to be hit with a forced 25% gratuity on your credit card slip!
When the Gelato Spot first opened, I thought it was outrageous to pay so much money for a little scoop of sweet confection and thought I would never step foot in the place.  Well, won't you know it someone had to go and get a gift certificate there for my birthday so I ended up going and well, I just love the place.
This place and all their other locations is like walking into AJ's- there's something about the ambiance and sense of quality that you just want to whip out your wallet and pay out the bucks and feel good that you just spent a zillion dollars for a tiny little scoop of sweet deliciousness.  And feel like it was totally worth it.
What can I say?  Some places just puts me in a brain freeze and I love every moment of it.
The lady was rude on the phone, and this company discriminates against dogs as well. Which is actually banned in the state of Nevada. I don't care if I loved the house I looked at, which I didn't. The carpets were filthy btw. I would never rent from a company who puts rude customer service agents on the phone, makes everything 1000x more difficult, and discriminates against  dog breeds? I'll take my money somewhere else
Professional and friendly. I had an 8AM appointment and they completed everything and I was on the road by 8:30. They also have a fantastic warranty program. I'm hooked. Thank you Discount Tire!!!
Decided to stop here after walking the strip looking for something other than a chain or overpriced burger place.  Probably should have looked at the menu first. It's basically an over priced faux barbecue place.  
The highs...our server was great. Attentive without being over bearing and even corrected a wrong drink order.  The food was delivered quickly after ordering and was cooked as requested (rare burger!). The food was good, not the best ever, and the beer selection was ok bud could use some local brews.
The lows...getting a $75 bill for a burger, salad, extra order of sweet potato fries and two drinks.  
There are lots of TVs and it's probably a go to place on game days. I would be willing to try it again if I had some of the 2 for 1 or that 20% off for Yelp deal.
Ate lunch here today. Excellent fare.  Ordered calamari, crab puffs and seared Ahi Tuna.  Simply fantastic.  I ordered Pad Thai and date ordered honey walnut chicken. Both were top notch. Everything was out and on our table within 20 minutes.  Great timing and service. I highly recommend the place for lunch.   I can't wait to return.
We ended up here after we couldn't find a Thai restaurant. Worked out really well. It was a Friday at lunch, so we got their fish and chip special. It took quite awhile to bring them all out, but basically all of us ordered it, so that may have been the reason. The meal ended up being very well priced (cheaper than what was listed on their website. Not sure if that's because it was lunch, or because it's just cheaper than what they have listed). Food was good and the portions were large. The waiter was very pleasant the the pub itself had a good atmosphere. If I'm in the area again and need to eat, I would totally go again (even though it's bordering on a pretty sketchy area).
Love this place!!! As a Bears fan I love havering a place to go and watch he game with other local bears fans!! The food is always awesome and they have the freshest oysters!!!
The worse customer service in my entire life! I am literally trying to give you money and you still cannot help me. I am trying to upgrade to an IPhone 6, 20 days early because my battery life after the new update sucks. I have made 5 phone calls to the 800 number in which I got 5 different answers. They keep telling me the store had to do the override. I am gladly trying to pay them a $35 early fee for doing nothing and they still won't take it. They say the 800 number has to note it and the 800 number says the store has to note it on my account. So not only do they not want $199 for the phone plus $35 fee and my $100 a month business! Fine, I will gladly go to Verizon after all these years.
I'm only giving this venue three stars not because I didn't enjoy the shows I've gone to see here - which I did, very much - but because of the following things about this theater that I don't like.  First of all, the waiting place is too small for all the people it struggles to accommodate, so you might get claustrophobic.  Also, though I know this isn't unique to this specific venue, not allowing someone to carry in their own water bottle - and then charging $5 for an average-sized water bottle - is ridiculous.  I've never had the alcoholic drinks there, but my friends have, and especially for the price, they were not impressive.  I highly recommend the shows here; just, don't come thirsty, hungry, or expecting to have much personal space.  You will get herded like cattle, end of conversation.
Take-out is sooooooo slow. Told me would be 20 minutes (which is on the long side for take-out already), got there after 25 minutes, and waited at least another 15-20 minutes for the food to be ready. And this is on a week night at 9pm. 

The food wasn't out of the world either, the yuzu salmon was fishy and did not meet expectation since I saw so many good reviews about it on Yelp. 

Probably won't be returning, there are so many sushi options in Vegas that are better, cheaper, and faster.
When I'm looking for a nice quiet drink in a clean bar this is always the place I choose. 

This is a place that I'd refer to as a bar for adults as opposed to those places where all those kids hang out.

Chances are you're not going to find a bunch of kids acting like they're having there first beer. If someone decides to have a shot you wont have to listen to all there friends yelling "Shot, Shot, Shot, Shot"

Good food, clean, good service. A class place!
How to cancel a flight due to a health reason. they asked me for my doctor's phone number as well as where I went. Still did not refund me they gave me a credit and still deducted the cost of the change. The customer service rep was rude and nasty towards me her tone what she said to me verbally on the phone was uncalled for by all means I will not fly JetBlue. The airline rep on the phone told me Jet Blue has the best customer service and refund policy and I should 'just go fly another airline carrier' and good luck with that. They have stricter refund policies. Untrue, SW airlines has a better refund policy for to medical
Emergencies, as well as a pleasant staff.
Yes they have so much stuff, and all that stuff is overpriced.  They need some sort of discount program where for every $150 you spend there you get $10 off of a purchase.  Maybe they already have something like this (I doubt it), but I'm not going to set foot in that place again til I have to.  The owner is rude at times also.  I returned a large piece of matboard like material with the receipt about 1 week after I originally purchased it.  I didn't even take it out of the plastic bag or my SUV after I bought it.  It was untouched and unused.  It was a $20 purchase, and she wouldn't let me return it because the corner of the material, perhaps 1\/4" x 1\/4" area in size, was bent a bit.  This piece had been sitting unused in the back of my SUV the whole time.  It didn't slide around as I was driving, I was careful while placing it in my SUV.  Regardless, she wouldn't accept the return, even though it was still in the original, immaculate condition. I guarantee it was in this condition when it was originally purchased.

Folks, check the condition of the stuff you buy before you leave the store, so that if you  may need to return, you'll be able to do so.
I had the best experience here! The ladies are so helpful and genuinely care about you and want to help you find your dream gown. They aren't pushy either, or treat you like youre just another sale. They also have a great variety of gowns from simple to elaborate. 
I highly recommend Brilliant Bridal.
Strip Mall Chinese, apart from being a fantastic name for a punk band is not a great descriptor for Ya Fei.  The restaurant is clean and well-decorated.  The chinese menu items are done well and...

So are the thai and japanese menu items.  With competition in the same strip mall from a Japanese place, I still find myself ordering sushi from here more often than not.  Similarly I find that the pad thai they serve here is better than the pad thai at the nearest Thai restaurant, less than a half mile away.

I probably order takeout from this location about once a week.  

Downside might be the recently increased price of their sushi, but still a great restaurant.
I came here one late afternoon, and it was pretty busy still! I just came to get a couple little mousse cups (my favorite). They had a Bailey's flavored - so I had to try it, and I got two chocolate ones. I also got a small mixed berry fruit tart. 
Everything was amazing - as usual - and I need more of the mousse cups in my life!! 
This was my first time at this specific location (I usually went to the NoDa one), but this one had a very large area that connected to another large lower floor.
Nostalgic. Don't remember many places with floor seating but this was one of them. If you don't feel adventurous or just hit the gym before going you can just sit on a chair in their other dining area. The floor seating is heated in the winter. 

You get minimal side dish, kimchi and radish only, though the kimchi was pretty big they had to give us a pair of scissors. I would go for their spicier dishes (army stew, rice cakes) as they were the ones that stood out of the bunch (don't go for chicken cutlet, just go to Galleria if you really want some). Purple\/brown rice option is a dollar extra, so no.

I went several times and every time the food and service was good. One of the male server even went above and beyond separating our bills into six different tabs with some complicated math equation halves thirds quarters.
Orders GF French toast, 2 scrambled eggs and coffee for $15. Very filling and yummy breakfast. Awesome to sit in the courtyard and relax
These guys are great! They've fixed a few flat tires for me for about $20. Fixes have always held up well. They never make me wait long and you never have to call ahead (for flat fixes). Super friendly.
The apple is decent if you live within walking distance but nothing to write home about.  Average draft selection.  Didn't get into bottles but found that the bartender that happened to be working was not overly friendly.  Went for a happy hour and it was dead.  Haven't been to the Apple in years but seems like a good place to meet friends and play darts all night.  Smoker friendly.  I couldn't tell the crowd that frequents it because it was so dead.
Ode to Top's Liquor

To look upon your well stocked shelves I smile,
You let me mix n' match my heart's desire.
Though sober now check back after awhile,
As bombers, pints and fifths sure spark a fire.
This social lube you offer is smooth n' cheap,
From Champagne, Brewski, Liquor to Wine.
Clever, friendly staff if asked for help will leap,
And serve impending hangovers of mine.
They also stock cigarettes and drunk treats,
True boozehounds know selection can't be beat!

Amateur poetry hour has now ended. To be returned to your regularly scheduled Yelp reviews, just scroll down.
I always wonder how boston pizza hasn't gone bankrupt, as every location I ever go to there's something wrong with either the food, or service. At this location, I found a big ass hair in my food. When I got the manager, he suggested buying me a dessert but I still had to pay for my pizzas which I took three bites of.
We had a very good experience on this trip. We had a large group and the staff handled it well. I struggled with what rating to give. I do not give out five stars lightly, but I really struggled with a reason to lower it at all.

The decor is like you have come to expect from Fleming's across the country. It is clean, and cool. The staff was attentive and friendly through out the evening. Our server was knowledgable and provided helpful advice on food and drinks.

We started with some wine for the table. Our server made a solid recommendation that was well received by the group. I wish I remembered the name of the wine.

We started with a few appetizers. I tried the Pan-Crisped Pork Belly. The pork belly comes with creamy goat cheese grits and sweet onion chutney. Those three components combined for some good flavor.

For my meal I ordered the Main Filet Mignon medium rare. It came out as ordered. The meat was juicy and packed solid flavor. We had several sides for the table as well. As always I ate a lot of Fleming's Potatoes. They are fantastic. I also ate some of the sautéed corn. That was a pleasant surprise. The flavors and textures were very good. The last side I tried was the Chipotle Cheddar Mac & Cheese. It was creamy and tasty. I was far too stuffed to order any dessert.
This place does not tell you that the rice that is normally supposed to come with your dish is an additional $1. The waitress did not even notify me. I ordered the hot pot and it wasn't even a hot pot. There was no soup (WTF)! The food is oily and lacks flavor. Overall, I feel like I really wasted my money here.
This Starbucks has a drive-thru...a definite perk. I've only been there a handful of times but twice they haven't made my iced tea correctly. When it was done right, it was delicious but it's not a hard order. I prefer my normal location on McClintock and Guadalupe but will come here in a pinch.
When we walked in (went for lunch break) we were greeted right away! We asked what was her favorite menu item, she said the burgers were what they are known for. So... of course we each got a burger! I got a regular hamburger with lettuce, mayo, tomatoes, and pickles (no onions for me!) it came with a side of fries as well. The food came out rather fast for being cooked when ordered. The burger was flat topped cooked (at least it seemed like it) and it was good!! The fries were a little too done for me, but I'm pretty picky about my fries. The vibe of the diner was nice and exactly what I expected. Everyone that worked there was so polite and friendly. We were checked on several times (even though you don't have a server). 

I will definitely be back, especially since I work two minutes away!
I love you American Apparel. Where else can I walk into an establishment and feel like I've walked into the 80s, my grandma's closet, Lady Gaga's closet, and a raunchy hooker store yet feel completely at home and in love with all the clothing??? Nowhere. Well, except maybe my closet after I finish buying all your wares. 

During my most recent trip I found the most fantastic item I think I've purchased to date.... fluorescent pink corduroy shorts... yes... as bright as the sun and absolutely beautiful. From the tights to the shorts to the oxford shirts, this place is the awesome.
I can't tell you how nice my car buying experience was. James hooked me up in every way. I told him what I was looking for... And the fact I would be away on vacation for a few weeks. While I was gone he found everything I was looking for, communicated everything to me quickly, and with almost no effort on my part I had a new car waiting for me in my driveway when I got home. If you want an effortless car buying experience I highly suggest talking to James from Five Star Auto!
What a great place to get all your Asian cravings. They offer great tasting Taiwanese, to Japanese, to Hong Kong cuisine at a great price. Some of the highlights include popcorn chicken, rice rolls, omurice, teppan rice\/pasta, soup noodles, drinks, and of course their golden toast desserts and many other desserts.
MAN are these cakes good! Great alternative for a pretty bday or special occasion cake, without the crazy high price. Ordering process was awesome. I was able to call the week of and got a 2-tiered 8" and 10" cake, 10" cake, and individual bundtlet that served as my 1-year old daughter's smash cake. This served about 45+ people! It was also nice to order these smaller cakes too so that we could try different flavors.

We tried the chocolate chocolate chip, lemon, red velvet, and white chocolate raspberry. They were all sooo delicious! My personal favorite was the white chocolate raspberry.

I didn't get a chance to visit the shop as someone else picked up the cakes but I definitely want to take a trip out to see it and to try some other flavors. My ordering experience was great and both women that I spoke to were kind, patient, and helpful.

I will definitely be ordering from here again!!
We came in late Friday night, and did not check in until 1am.  We were pleasantly surprised to be told our room was upgraded to a terrace suite.  This suite was impressive.  It was on the corner of the building and the balcony wrapped around both sides.  The suite has its own washer and dryer, two full bathrooms, a full kitchen, wine fridge, and just about every other amenity you could ever want.  The view of the strip from the balcony was impressive.

The building footprint is small, but they fit a lot into it.  We did not get the chance to try any of the food options or shop, but we will next time.  I also will be coming back in the summer to take advantage of at least one of the pools.

It is pricier than most, but it is worth it to treat yourself.
Pretty good. Wasn't spectacular but I'd return if others wanted to go. Inside looks better than the outside of the building does.
worst bank ever terrible service and they do not understand much about banking, being there made me want to switch banks
holy muhamarra.

If you're planning on going to Sumac which I strongly recommend you do it's best to avoid tight fitting clothing and acquire someone who is willing to give you a belly rub after because the food is just so divine you won't be able to stop eating.

I got the muhamarra (a red pepper walnut dip) and a salad trio to share and it was plenty of food. Between the two of us there was still so much left over. All the salads we tried were incredible!

This restaurant is so veggie friendly but not in the way that makes your omnivore friends grumpy to be there since they have an incredible spread of options. Their homemade drinks were wonderful and if you can't decide between the two ask for a half & half; it's insane. 

My only problem with the restaurant was that it didn't have a very clear ordering system. You have to give your order and then you sit down and they serve you. Even as we were taking our order it wasn't a very clear interaction. Over all though; the food is just so fantastic you won't remember anything else!
Walked in to order a pizza. What I wanted was very simple. A pizza pie and extra mozzarella cheese on the side so when I go home, I can put cold cheese on top of the warm pie. In NY, it's called cold cheese pizza. I was looked at like I was crazy and the manager said they don't do that because I'd be leaving with their product uncooked. I've been to many pizzerias in AZ, and never encountered this before. If I'm paying for the item, what I do with it after is none of your concern. Waiting in the pizzeria right now to try it for the first time, let's see how it goes. So far something very simple became very complex.
Coming from Southeast Michigan, the Arab capital of North America, I am a bit of a Middle Eastern food snob. This place was aight but definitely not as good or fresh as the food back home. 

I took the Yelp tips seriously and ordered extra extra sauce on my mixed falafel and chicken bowl. I also opted against the supposedly super duper hot sauce. I think the extra sauce helped moisten the (somewhat dry) chicken and the (not so great) falafels. In the bowl, there was shredded taco-like lettuce and tomatoes that didn't add much to the flavor. The pita bread was dry and definitely wasn't fresh. Bowl toppings were limited and the kalamata olives added the most flavor. The small side of hummus ($1) wasn't the best and I actually ended up throwing it away. All in all, the food seemed a bit prefabricated and didn't seem as authentic or homemade as what I'm used to. 

I am sure this place is a nice, convenient option for some folks. The service was pleasant and efficient. I am glad I gave it a shot but I think I'd opt for another spot for my next Middle Eastern cuisine fix.
My fiance and I have had Jersey Mike"s a couple of times and so far we are very impressed. Subs are a food group to him, so I take his opinion very seriously.  The folks that work at Mike's actually take the time to put your sandwich together nicely with a ton of veggies and meat.  It is not like some of the other sub chains where they are trying to play beat the clock and smash your food together with little care or courtesy so you end up with a flat messy sandwich.  The bread is great and the veggies are fresh and ripe, no green tomatoes and wilted lettuce here.  We will definitely be going back!
The only thing I like about this place is the massive $7 long-islands, other than that this place doesn't really do it for me. It is constantly crowded with angry people who just want to fight. They have some good drink specials but nothing to shout over aside from the long-islands. Atmosphere is just dirty, no real-theme to the place and staff is very rude.
I absolutely love coming here ! They know exactly how to treats every customer. Everything is clean and smells fresh . Permanante home !! Thank you Kelly and Q
What I noticed right away when walking into any Nekter location is the delightful smell of freshly juiced fruits and vegetables. I love the smell!

I also love the baskets of fresh fruits and vegetables . . . it took me a couple of visits to realize the baskets of fresh fruits and vegetables were in fact realistically fake!!!  They look real enough to eat!!!

The menu is simple and straight forward. And I appreciate that they list the calories of each juice and smoothie so you can make the right choices. 

I've had 3 or 4 of their juices\/ smoothies and they are all refreshing and tasty. 
Anyone who has gone here has told me how much they love their juices\/ smoothies. 

As for the wait. Be GLAD for the wait- cause then you know you are getting the real product and not some type of syrup that they are calling real juicing. If you have ever done juicing or made smoothies from scratch before (like I have)- you KNOW each serving takes a while to make!!!  As for the price?  When you juice or make fresh smoothies on your own, you come to realize even one made at home cost $3-4 dollars by the time you add up the cost of all the fresh fruit\/ vegetables and other ingredients!!!

I love Nekter- I hope they are successful and stay around for the long duration!
I'm from New England and Hibachi is way cooler there. The food is better. the act is better ...and funnier. Our guy was so boring! (he was nice though and seemed new) As were the other hibachi chefs in the room. The cut of steak (rib eye) was really fatty. fried rice was awesome, but c'mon...I can easily make that at home. not too impressed. first hibachi place I've ever been to in Phoenix and first time I've truly missed New England.
Boyfriend and I saw this restaurant on MTL Blog's list of 101 Restaurants You Should Eat At Before you Die. Personally, I don't know that it should have made the list. The food for the most part was OK, their brisket was slightly dry, fries were good, pulled pork was alright, chicken, I have to say was juicy, and the fried mac'n'cheese was pretty damn delicious. Wasn't a fan of the coleslaw or the greens. Small place, giving a quaint feel, staff was great. Price point wasn't bad. Hated that they give plastic cutlery. Very difficult to cut away chicken with plastic. 
All in all, not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it again.
The bar is in a great location within the Palms, so it is a great place to meet friends or people watch.  There are a lot of tables as well as seats at the bar.  The decor is cool and modern.  The staff is ok.  They are friendly when you order, but they do not seem good at speaking to the customers otherwise.  The drinks are affordable by Las Vegas standards, and they have a decent selection of quality drink options.
Sweet things.
Treat things.
Gleamy things.
Creamy things.
Things that crumble. Things that puff.
Sprinkly things and glistening stuff.
Pastries, cakes and horns of cream.
Pinch me. OW. It's not a dream.

The only reason I don't come in here ALL THE TIME is because, frankly, I'm terrified of the staff. I can't understand how someone can be surrounded by so much yumminess all the time and yet be so sad. Perhaps it is because they don't get to eat all the lovely things while they're on duty...

However, they are artists. Their creations are beautiful. They made the 3rd birthday cake for Yelp and it was incredible. I just had a cream horn and it was ENORMOUS, crispy, sweet, fluffy and only £1.05. They can make cakes to spec, including gluten free, ice them with a custom image for just an extra £4, and all sorts of delicious options. They are cakey royalty.
This place was super cute and service was great. It was very clean, relaxing, and my toes came out perfect. Located on High Street so it's the perfect spot for a ladies night out and you can hit up a bar or restaurant afterwards. They give you a complimentary drink, which is a really nice touch. 

Just be sure to book an appointment ahead of time because I was told they get booked up fast and have limited nail technicians. I would definitely come back if I lived closer.
Came here with work colleagues to find out there is no Happy Hour here on Fri & Sat. But decided to give this place a try and ordered some of their Garlic Fries. They came out lukewarm and had so much oil they were soggy. No garlic taste at all. The pizza we ordered we just average. Food wise nothing special if not a little disappointing. 

I personally wouldn't try this place again but if your looking to take the family out, your kids would have a blast. There is a lot for them here and you can enjoy a beer. Little pricey game wise too.
I can't give a bad review about a doughnut place....Although I was disappointed that my treat here tasted the same as one from KK--not a bad thing though. 

Albeit it was $0.20 cheaper per fried goodness which is a pro. 

They had a very interesting Oreo encrusted cream filled doughnut which my BF particularly enjoyed. 

Not much to keep me coming back and choosing Greenbush's over another chain except that I try to avoid chains when I can.
Out of all the popular fro-yo places, Yogurtland is surely the best! I have never had a bad experience and come here often. The flavors are diverse and delicious! I personally go for any chocolate, graham cracker, pistachio or any flavors in that family. The toppings bar is also really fresh and always stocked with plenty of goodies! You can get anything from fresh fruit to candy to cereal to sauce. The staff is also very friendly and sample cups are always available upon arrival. Prices are reasonable unless you fill up your cup with a lot (like myself). For two normal size cups, my boyfriend and I usually spend around $10. Great location, right off the 202 inside a complex with In and Out and Starbucks. Overall, this place is amazing and I will keep coming back!
We went late one night about 35 minutes before closing. We were the only patrons at that time and were treated very well. The service was excellent as was my wife's chicken teriyaki and my tempura and noodles. If we go back to Toronto, we will be sure to go back to this restaurant.
I have never been a big fan of AYCE or buffets since I prefer better quality food over a large quantity. Recently our family suggested that we check out Kaka. Everything tasted good and it was very easy to order the food through their tablet. Food came out quickly and we got everything we ordered. There is a 2 hours seating limit. Even if there is nobody waiting for your table or you come late, the 2 hours limit starts from your reservation time. I find it a bit pricey at $29.99 on a weeknight but they are one of the better AYCE Japanese restaurants.
One of my more frequent Thai choices in Vegas. Nice patio area. Service usually solid. Mango rice dessert is decent. I usually order beef spicy salad (which I love here) and Thai spicy cashew chicken made 9 or 10 hot. Great brown sauce. Been here at least ten times. Consistently solid experiences.
WOW was I pleasantly surprised at this rare treasure of a place. Great to stop by and look around or just relax. I went to a Folknet, and plan to keep going to all their events. Well worth my trip
Love this place.  The drinks are awesome.  We are always treated nice by the staff when we go here, my fiancé and I.  I love the New Orleans feel of the place.  The gator tails which are not on the menu... you have to request them, are delicious.  I enjoy the crawfish and shrimp fondue.
Until recently, Sanctuary Spa was my fav spa in Phoenix.  Regardless, this spa is a first class facility with immaculate customer service.  If you want to feel pampered and special, this is the place to come.  
And block out the whole day to enjoy this place~ it is gorgeous and very relaxing!
They not only helped me figure out what I needed for my bike, but then changed out all the parts for me too. He also suggested and made an adjustment to make it more comfortable for me. I don't really know anything more than how to ride a bike at this point so I was very appreciative of their help. I was in and out in less than 15 minutes and spent way less than I thought I would!
Well, I have yet to visit their store but I did sign up on the website with my email and was ready to order 4 golf visors along with some golf balls.   The promo offers a 15% discount and i waited and waited for my code that never came.  Called customer service and the very unhelpful person on the other end ended up hanging up on me.  I was not rude, I just wanted what was promised on their website.  Guess I will spend my money somewhere else, especially after seeing the other reviews here.  Good luck Golf Galaxy!
Tons of TVs with run of the mill food bar food. Service is consistent, beers are cheap and there are tons of screens to watch sports on. 

I've sampled a few different items but nothing has blown my mind. I do like the sweet potato tots though. The cajun chicken sandwich wasn't bad but I wish the bottom piece of bread didn't come out soggy.

They have a large dining area, bar seating, a private room that you can reserve if you are bringing a large group and a pretty nice patio with TVs. 

If you are looking for a sports bar in the area Jocks & Jills is a decent choice.
Solid steakhouse. Great atmosphere, can cook your own steaks if you choose, which is half the fun. Friendly servers and easy access off the interstate. We found this place via YELP and were very pleased. Highly recommend.
This place is so good! The service is excellent. The moment you walk in their store they immediately make you feel so at home. They are so attentive! I love love this place so much! 

It's awesome how they always have different flavors everyday. My favorite by far is the Green Tea Kit-Kat! 

Amazing!
Alas, I just went by here the other day and it seems that they couldn't make their rent payments and had to shut down :( It's too bad that another good place couldn't make it, but the location wasn't great and the restaurant business is very tough at the best of times. 

Here's hoping that they reopen, or that the owner takes his recipes somewhere with better foot traffic.
I came for the French fries which were great! But their chicken I would not buy again. I can make better.
Wow!  Just loved everything about this experience.  The food was very delicious, the waiters were constantly making sure we had enough water, were satisfied with our food, and were otherwise taken care of.  The decoration of the place is cool, too - definitely not what you'd expect looking at it from the outside.  And, for all you vegetarians\/vegans, there's plenty to eat here - and though I can't remember what dish I had (the waiter picked it out for me), it was SO good!  Definitely a spot I'll come back to.
Jim from JPG Home Security came by today and inspected our house for a new security alarm.  He was very knowledgeable and straight forward on what types of alarms and sensors our home needed to protect our family.  Knowing he was previously in law enforcement it was neat to get an "inside view" of how criminals work and how we can combat their tactics. 

We had previously been setup with ADT but it was setup wrong and wasn't completely keeping us safe.  Thankfully, Jim got us all setup correctly and we are glad we used him.  We even were able to get a new keypad that works with our cell phone, something we really liked.

Being a business owner myself, I can really tell when an owner is ethical and trustworthy and Jim and his company definitely fit that description.  I'm going to recommend him to any of our friends or family who are interested in home protection or alarm systems.
It has been years since we have been to this location, but glad to see the quality of food is still great! They have a large selection of pizzas and pastas. We went with a large group on a Friday night and our table was available on time and we had great service. Food came put promptly and delicious. We shared some mussels and salad to start and for the mains we got the Capri (linguine with shrimps and clams) and Penza (rigatoni with spicy panchetta in a creamy tomato sauce). Enjoyed everything especially the Penza!
My son & I came here to eat after an Adventure Run and ordered the chicken quesadilla & the chicken tender kid's meal. 
We were both disappointed with our meals. The chicken quesadilla did not have enough cheese in there and chicken tender in the kid's meal was not real chicken- it was processed. The fruit that came with the meal was not fresh, it was the canned fruit kind except it came in a plastic cup. So neither one of us really enjoyed our meal. The chicken quesadilla was a large portion size and came with sour cream & lettuce & tomato. The kid's meal portion was small. My son was still hungry afterwards. 
The complimentary chips & salsa was tasty. 
The place was packed with runners from the Adventure Run and it did not seem like they had enough waitstaff. My son had to grab the waiter twice to get his attention. 
Overall, the atmosphere is good. We would go back and give the menu another try but I would not recommend anything on the kid's menu. Better off ordering off of the regular menu and have leftover to take home for the kids.
Beautiful venue, love the architectural style of the building, love the location. Inside, it's bright and airy and the best part is despite the large number of people it can hold, there are no bad seats in the house. Anywhere you seat, you can get a good view of the stage. Keep this in mind if you are purchasing tickets and are on a budget. Even the least expensive seats are good seats!
If you are here for a matinee show, pack a picnic lunch and go out to the patio area or stroll to the Tempe town lake, sit away, have your picnic and enjoy yourself!
I was so excited to find a diner that was open late hours and serving real diner food.  Unfortunately, there were too many things about this place that I didn't enjoy that I most likely won't go back unless I'm with a group and I lose the vote.  

Upon entering during a busy weekday morning, we were seated pretty quickly, but the hostess and people behind the counter did not appear friendly.  Our server was nice, and the orders came out after a wait, but the food was not great, and expensive for diner food.  I am used to breakfast bills coming in under $20, but not here.  Music was playing loudly at 8 AM and it was hard to have a conversation with someone.  I really wanted to like this place, but wasn't impressed.
Friday night post event find- right across from hannys.

Decorated like a dark "gastropub" this spot has a little patio area with a bar & booths inside.

The prices are reasonable for wine all under $9.  I also try the kebobs which are homemade yummy goodness.  Served over green beans the chicken kebobs also have onions, peppers, mushrooms, and tomatoes.  This dish is served with a corn salsa.  I would make this at home!  The food was served hot but I would have liked a minute or two more on the green beans.  Most of the chicken had a nice light char.

Our server Karen was very nice & helpful without being overbearing!  This is a gem in downtown Phoenix.
I cannot say enough about this place, it is as good or better than most Greek places I have been to costing 2x as much, the soups were outstanding as were the kafta and chicken kabobs.  The gyro plate was very good as well. The staff was friendly enough to make you feel you were in their own home.
I brought my Audi to Arizona Import Specialists after it failed the inspection and emissions test.  Before I even got it there, Mike spent a while on the phone with me looking up codes and offering wisdom.  Once there, we had many conversations about what he saw, what was worthwhile to fix, and what was not.  Because I received such an honest and complete evaluation, I was able to decide to buy a new car instead of repairing what I brought in.  They even offered to inspect a used car for free before I purchased it.  These guys know how to win over a customer for life!
The Hard Rock belongs off the strip back where nobody can see it. For a place that has been remodeled it sure has gone down hill fast.

The service is terrible. The staff is rude, especially the security. The security staff acts like you are bothering them if you ask them a question. The cashiers in the cage  are extremely rude, but not as rude as the valet attendants. The dealers are cool and so were the cocktail servers.

It does not matter how the rooms are, because the staff and the management is horrible. So, I do not need to review the rooms because I do not recommend that anyone should come here. This place used to be one of the best spots in Vegas to hang out and party. What a shame.
If you're looking for straight-forward good Thai food then Thai Cuisine is the place to go. No frills, BYOB, no spa-like music simple Thai. It was quite good-I can't say it was an over the moon astounding, mind blowing, life changing experience, but it was good and what you want when you go for Thai food. 

My husband had the spicy duck and it had good flavor, although more of a 5 than 7 on a 1-10 spicy scale. Really good. 

I had spicy noodles chillin' at my standard 7 on the 1-10 scale. I can't complain. The noodles were great and the vegetables were deliciously cooked (I tend to go vegetarian). 

I will say the dumplings and spring rolls we had as appetizers were a notch above what we've had elsewhere in Pitt. 

We will definitely go back!
Loved Mallorca. The food is AMAZING! Cannot go wrong with it. The service was good and there are so many specials.

I got paella and loved it. I also had leftovers for 3 days, too. The place is pretty dressy and would recommend that you look nice. It gets very crowded and you NEED reservations to get seated. 

Go here for Spanish\/Portuguese food and you will not be disappointed.
Je pensais vraiment faire une bonne affaire en allant manger là le midi....Question "qualité\/prix", mais je me suis trompé. Bien que le menu soit intéressant et peu dispendieux, (entre 6 et 10$ pour une soupe, rouleaux et plats)...Ce n'était pas très appétissant. La soupe ne goûtait pas grand chose et il y avait seulement UN won ton...J'ai commander des nouilles croustillante, poulet et légumes. Le poulet goûtait le poulet bouillit blanc...et les légumes le congelé....Le rouleau...mmmm je ne sais pas ce qu'il y avait dedana...c'était louche...Bref... Pour finir...PAS d'INTERACT.... 

Si vous êtes en mode Low budget...allez-y de la nourriture ça reste de la nourriture, mais sinon...il y a d'autres resto dans le quartier chinois bien meilleur...
The whole experience was disappointing.
Went out to eat with my husband- was greeted by a friendly hostess and seated almost right away. ( No wait on a Friday night should have been a red flag )

For some reason we had two servers?? -overlapping sections maybe? Who knows- either way it was confusing and made no sense why neither of them were actually waiting on us- we waited a while just to be greeted (enough time that we knew what we were ordering) Our food took about 25 minutes to come out, and when it did it was incomplete and my entree was completely cold, and the plate was scorching hot. Meaning it sat in the window for way too long. We waited and waited for one of our servers to come check on us just so we could send the cold food back! They never apologized and looked unsurprised to see that my husband had basically already finished his meal by the time my hot entree was re-served. Overall food was unimpressive and definitely not worth the price or the wait.
Manager came by asking how our dinner was and seemed desperate- she kept saying things like "promise you'll come in again?" But didn't comp any part of our meal.
Overall very disappointing. But looks like we weren't the only people who wrote a bad review and despite the manager's plea- won't be coming back.
Beautiful salon, friendly staff.  Hair washing includes a nice arm and scalp massage.  Gotta love that.

Reina did a wonderful job with my haircut and style.  Super sweet, good listener.  Better yet~ good with her scissors and blow dryer!

In and out in an hour with a good cut and an easy good looking style.

Happy, happy!
First time I went here I placed a take out order.  Let me state this: I'm surprised I returned yesterday for lunch.  
Lunch yesterday: was by far a better experience than the first.   Jayla, whom brought our orders was a ray of sunshine!  She immediately made the corrections and followed up quite often:).  Food was fresh, not very fresh- but good.  It came out in a decent amount of time, however not 'piping hot', but no cold either.  Pastries in my opinion are some what dry, if I do return for a third (three times a charm) I don't believe I would make a go of the pastries.  Believe me, I clearly have a sweet tooth!  Have you seen my Yelp and Instagram pictures;) 
Bonus here are the fluids so Coffee, teas, lemonades- yes, refreshments.  Those are tasty (except I do prefer Pepsi).  I'm about the half and half: ice tea and mix it up with lemonade aka Arnold Palmer).
Thought it was an awesome burger but .... For around 10 bucks the bun ate up the small burger.... I think you can upsize the portion of beef, but I just won't pay 12 bucks for a burger
Saw the sign about food & brew...so glad we did. Great staff, great food, and superb beer! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
I like this location quite a bit. I like the bulk selection too, the milk chocolate covered honey combs are friggin awesome. Basically, all of the bulk items are pretty good. I also like the produce choices too. Fresh and good choices. I don't care for the butcher. At all. 3 times I have bought meat\/chicken from them and let's just say it was not good. I also love that they are next to Total Wine...total plus.
Up until last week, this was on regular lunch rotation. We stopped going here because a couple of us had bad stomach pain. Good timing because they also just increased their prices and are pushy on the upsell. Avoid sushi bowls and careful of what you order :s
Displayed in a glass case are delicious baklava & ravani. Both the baklava & ravani are always impeccably fresh, as are all of Meraki's menu items.  The baklava & ravani are there as you order, so go ahead and order one of each. you won't regret it!  
Meraki has traditional Greek cuts, always tender, robust and basted with lemon, Greek olive oil and various herbs.  They offer classic gyros and are always spot on! 
The Greek spreads such as tzatziki are always consistent and hit the spot!  Who can resist not ordering garlic and cucumbers;)   Perhaps when you first try Meraki May I suggest ordering the combo of spreads.  
The staff exudes enthusiasm and ask away for dining recommendations.
Are you a blonde, or considering going blonde?  After years of frustration I finally found a hairdresser who is a genius with color! Her name is Lisa Fournier and she has been with Grandstrands for many years. I have been using her for almost 10 years.  Make sure that you plan ahead when making your appointments, as she is usually heavily booked! You will LOVE your color, and for those who have long hair, she isn't scissor happy like many hairdressers I have come across. I moved since starting to use her and now have a 35-40min. drive to get there, but it's worth it!
So So Mex food if not poor.  Expensive for what you get.  2 stars for fair to good cocktails.   Somewhat pretentious staff.  Been there twice, dead both nights.  Wouldn't serve me dinner one night when I stopped in at about 9:30 so I left (they were admittedly dead that night as well).
I have to say I have been to Four Peaks probably at least 15 times in the past 10 months I've lived in Phoenix. That's pretty bad. But also shows how awesome Four Peaks is. 

First off, the beer is fantastic. I love several of their brews, specifically the Peach Ale and Hop Knot. If there's a seasonal out at the time, try it. Even if it's not your style, you will appreciate how well crafted it is. 

The food is never bad. Never. I've had pizza, beer bread, burgers, appetizers, and wings and they have never let me down. It's probably some of the best pub food I've ever had. The fries are to die for. If you want a great appetizer for a group, go for the spinach dip. I swear the dish it comes in never goes empty and I'm not really joking. I once ordered one as my dinner, quickly became full and offered some to about 12 friends and we only were able to finish half. 

The place is insanely huge too. Lots of different areas to sit depending on your mood and all of them are great spots. I prefer the little covered patio area off to the side the best. 

It's true the Four Peaks is always busy, but I've never waited more than 5-10 minutes to be seated, even with a group of 7. Their service has never suffered with a crowded house.
I absolutely love this place. I searched for five years to find this hidden gem. Rachel does my hair perfectly and she is so sweet. They have great prices and wonderful attention to detail. Rachel always remebers what she did with your hair the previous time. I would highly recommend her and Lewis' to anyone!
We swung by after happy hour on a Friday, and were surprised that it wasn't busy and we were able to sit right down.  We chowed on the chips and salsa, and our waitress was happy to fill us up again.   For dinner, I had another yummy black bean and cheese burrito!  Everyone seemed pleased with their food and I just love quaint little downtown Chander.  

Now if only they served Z'Teja's margaritas here....
My go to place for sandwiches. Staff is friendly and good attitude. They never run out of stock for my favourite items.Recommmended.
Switch to Rudy's and save!
The sandwiches used to leave me feeling hungry. But not anymore! Now that I switched to loaded Potato with meat- my hunger is gone!
Thank you Rudys!!!!
But seriously folks, I moved down the road some years ago and don't get to visit as often. This place is affordable with great tasting BBQ. Try if one and you'll thank me.
What?????  It's been almost 4 months and I have been coming here to practice the 26 postures in 105 degrees for 90 minutes almost daily and loving it?!?!  Yes, hard to believe- it's true.

Those of us who have never tried Bikram Yoga, just the mention of 105 degrees for 90 minutes sends us to fear.  Like me, before I came in one day and gave it a try and then keep at it for 5 days in a row. 

Miraculously, once you commit to this Bikram as a daily practice, you find yourself loving the 26 postures, the 105 degrees, the passing of the 90 mins.

Seriously, I Yelp frankly.  I don't know if your body can detox through the sweat and the postures but that's what it feels like.  Coming to practice daily, my body feels more cleansed and lighter.  And I find myself judging myself less.  Each day I stare into the mirror and I give myself grace to not be perfect, to allow my body to be where it is at that moment.  And I begin to love the sacredness of the space created by my yoga mat.  It's beautiful.  It's serene.  It's unexpected.

The hardest part, really is getting yourself in to do the first class.  The second hardest part is to commit and come in for 5 days in a row.  Cause I won't lie, it is hard in the beginning to get use to the heat and the postures.

But if you preserver, your body adjusts and the room feels less hot.  You are less concerned with the heat because whatever is happening both your body and mind goes through a transformation.  It's calmer.  It's different every day- and it's okay.  That's the best part.  A good day, a bad day, it's all okay.

If you have been thinking about doing Bikram and hesitate, don't!  Just come in and give it a try.  This particular location is a good one to come as a first timer because every single instructor here is wonderful.  Warm, kind, and encouraging.  I've taken classes from all of them at various times and I love them all.  

I also hear the same from other students.  Some of them drive from what I would consider far distance to come to this location.

Here are some practical tips:  for Bikram yoga, when you're buying a yoga mat, buy natural rubber and it's actually better if the thickness is between 3 - 5 cm thick.  Any thicker and you're wobbly with your postures.

At the beginning you will sweat more, learn not to be bother by it or wipe it off.  It's all good.  After consistent practice, you start thinking about it less.

It's nice to have a yoga towel but not necessarily- I used a large beach towel for many months but I did end up buying 3 yoga towels and I wash them daily and rotate them.  It is nicer with yoga towels- esp. the micro fiber kind.

Clothes made for Bikram yoga are super comfy.  They really just mold to your skin.  I practiced with regular sports bra and shorts for the longest time and recently bought clothes specifically for Bikram and now I'm converted!

Bring water- I ususally drink 40 oz in 90 mins.  Iced is nice.  

And leave fear, worry, and judgment at the door.  There is just you, the mirror, and your breath.  So simple, it's all you need.  See you on the mat!!!
If I could give zero I would. Sat for 20 minutes, the front desk had 6 people before me get served and couldn't explain why. Then a tech said put her with me, a lady that came after me complained and they switched me to someone else without reason. This is poor customer service and it's always in the evening. Maybe I should complain loudly to get better service. My money is green too.
I really enjoyed this little restaurant! I went at around 11AM on a Friday.  The place is small but there are about 8 tables in there.  It's family owned and everyone chips in.  The little fella that was the cashier, Julian was the BEST! Great customer service and he was really knowledgeable on the items.  I loved the windy city fries! Be warned that the small is pretty large! I would definitely go back...
J'ai tellement passé souvent devant ce resto et la devanture ne me donnais pas très envie de rentrer dans ce resto....ET POURTANT...j'aurai dû.  Mes collègues étaient partant pour aller là...et ils étaient 2, alors ils ont gagné la place où il fallait aller dîner. Ils m'ont dit que les portions étaient grosses...j'étais comme oui...comme dans tous les restos grecques...blablabla..tsédodu comme je suis,  je m'en étais capable ERREUR. HEY C'EST UN RESTO POUR LES GENS QUI ONT FAIM!! omg!!! On a tous commander l'assietteS de Gyros....j'ai mis assiettes avec un "S", car c'était 2 assiettes et oui.....une moyenne pour le MÉGA GYRO et une hyper grosse avec le riz, salade (avec mega morceau de feta) pis des bonnes frites mmm... 

J'ai eu récemment une opération à la bouche....alors le gyro ne rentrait pas...et même si ma bouche avait été en parfaite santé...les bouchées auraient été difficile. La viande était ohhh que délicieuse...des parties tendres, juteuses, "broils"...bref délicieux...le tout avec des tranches de tomates...oignon et sûrement de la laitue et le tout garni de sauce  tzatziki aussi gros que le sandwich en tant que tel... 

Je souhaite vraiment retourner un jour avec quelqu'un'un pour partager un plat à 2...car le plat est immense et essayer les calmars...!

Je ne met pas 5*, car malgré toutes les célébrités (genre BILL CLINTON OMGGG), et les nombreux merveilleux avis dans les médias...la place n'a pas d'l'air très propre. Par contre j'adore l'effet vieillot... La serveuse est vraiment sympathique et on reçoit un bonbon à la menthe à la fin YESSS Croyez-moi que ça aide beaucoup...car le goût de l'ail reste longtemps dans notre gorge!!! À oui aussi...même si la salade était très fraiche....j'avais l'impression qu'il n'y avait pas de vinaigrette.. :(  BREF MERCI LE VILLAGE JE VOUS AIMES!!
Awful costumer service!!! I felt like I was being rushed even though there weren't any people behind me. I'm assuming the woman who "assisted" me was a manger because she was the only one I saw in a red shirt. But she needs a course on costumer service. She was very short and acted as if I was wasting her time. I don't care how badly we want bagels we will never return to this location.
WOOHOOO!!!! Alma mater what! I finished my undergrad here and also attended graduate school here. I would've found it hard to go elsewhere after seeing this campus for the first time.

I loved KSU. The campus is gorgeous and so full of history. Many more green pastures than its next door neighbor the University of Akron. Because of the vast size of campus in order to give some character, the buildings could be a little far apart, but it was worth it in my opinion. Some of those walks and the people watching that occurred were epic. 

My professors, particularly in graduate school were amazing and it was fairly easy to find the resources one needed to study or do anything else for that matter. We had our share of fun festivals (we all know the Black Squirrel should be the mascot right?) and campus activities. One of my favorites was the Wyclef concert, though now I'm probably dating myself. 

There's lots to do in the vicinity and always something going on around campus. I mean come on... Eastway Center has a bowling alley (or did).

The Ratt in the basement of the student center is always a good time. I had a few review sessions with professors and classmates down there while enjoying a brew.

Drew Carey bought shots for everyone at one of the local bars once.. but now I'm just name dropping :)
I really enjoyed the stay here. There are way more positive reasons to stay here than negative. 

The staff is extremely professional and friendly.   We were checked in by Mr. Stormie Daye.  He was friendly,  efficient and informative.  Poolside service,  Blake was wonderful.   He made extra efforts and offered great advice. We ordered pizza from the Caribe and it was very good quality.  Everyone greets you.  That's great. 

The rooms are wonderful.  Our room was like a one bedroom apartment with a dining area and full kitchen. We saved money by buying groceries and cooking breakfast and having drinks and snacks on hand.   There were 2 full baths. Master bath has a huge jetted tub. The balcony is large. There is a bedroom separate from the living area. The bed was comfortable.  There are 2 tv's, so no sharing. The pull out couch is an awesome asset. Lastly the room is well lit.   

The pool area is amazing.  Amazing!   Unlike some other hotels you can actually swim in this pool. It's large enough. There are 2 sides.  One larger size with the water fall which you can swim under. This pool also has the restaurant right next to the pool.  The other side has 4 water slides. 2 smaller ones and 2 larger ones. Plus another small swim area. There are 5 hot tubs located throughout.  There are many places to sit,  chill or eat plus hammocks.  Lots of shade. There is a huge bbq area near the pool with dining table near by. 

Other great amenities. ..an activity room with billiards,  24 hour business center,  plenty of luggage trollies, very clean resort and good security. 

Negatives. There are not a lot. When dialing 0 for service,  long wait.  At one point no answer.   It seemed to take awhile to get something delivered like towels.   I'm not sure I understand why we need cards for pool towels.  The cards are not guest specific so there really isn't any control.   

 If the resort reads these reviews,  there are a few suggestions.   We ate our pizza on our balcony to enjoy the evening. It would be nice to have an outdoor dining set out there rather than just the 2 chairs and small side table.   There is enough room for a table and 4 chairs.

Again, not a lot of negatives.  They are very minor compared to the positives.  Great place!!
Took a drive out to Rhyolite this past week during my stay in Vegas. It was about 115 miles each way, and made for a good day trip (and alternative to feeding my money into the slot machines). Rhyolite is over a hundred years old, and it's an honest-to-God ghost town which makes it both a solemn and exciting experience. Stop at the bottle house first, and grab a pamphlet so you can give yourself a self-guided tour. There's also a guest book you can sign. 

Restrooms are located further up the road. There are two, and they are porta-potty style, but enclosed in a small building. 

There were signs warning about rattlesnakes, so be wary when walking around. While you could drive up along the main road and never get out of your car, most people found a place to park and walked around to get the full effect. Amongst the mountain backdrop, are the remains of some of the old town's main business buildings. They have signs posted out front indicating what you are looking at. The buildings are pretty well preserved considering the fact they are over a century old. Also, I was impressed that there was no vandalism! The area is kept pretty clear of trash and there are some backroads that lead to an old house, jail, and a grave site. 

Photo enthusiasts will find a lot of things to keep them happy. Most of the buildings are behind some kind of fence, or wire, but you can get pretty close and take great pictures. 

There is definitely a feeling of the past when you're there. It felt a bit sacred to me, to walk through and imagine the people who had lived there and the high hopes they had before they had to leave. 

Rhyolite is just 4 miles outside of Beatty. If you kept going, you could probably go to Death Valley National Park (I hope to go next time). Also, along the road to Rhyolite you will pass the Goldwell Open Air Museum, which you should definitely check out since it's very cool and somewhat eccentric, and also, right there.
Trop nice comme endroit...avex beaucoup beaucoup beaucoup de choix de boissons alcoolisés...Moitié prix sur la bière et les pots massons pendant le 5 à 7.  Yeah!
The Saint Laurent street corridor has a host of restaurants of all types, particularly clustered around the Complexe Ex-Centris shopping mall. 

Most of the restaurants have a polished feel, nearly all with candle lights on every table in a darkened setting, in contemporary designs and decent service. 

Buona Notte (Good Evening\/Night in Italian) is right in the thick of this, across the street from the Complexe. It has a variety of Italian dishes, with antipasta dishes priced in the teens (CAD) and various pastas priced in the 20's. 

There are about 5 or 10 Italian restaurants in this section of town within a couple of blocks, and this one is moderately priced, contemporary but casually decorated, and a decent choice.

From their website:

Like many other Mills malls, this one is HUGE. It is a 1.4 million-square-foot behemoth filled with a 24 screen + IMAX theater, dining options, and tons of retail\/outlet\/factory stores.

This place is a zoo on weekends. Filled to the brim with tourists looking to score some bargains. I would recommend avoiding it... If you want to shop without the crowds, go on a weekday. 

Let me tell you a little secret about factory stores... Executives have gotten wise to consumers looking for a good deal. These companies actually create specific items to sell exclusively at factory stores (lower quality = lower cost). Banana Republic, Coach, Eddie Bauer, Gap (and many more) are all guilty of it... If you are looking for bargain deals on full price merchandise (likely from last season), go to a true outlet store (TJ Maxx, Off 5th, etc).
The entrance is a little confusing. Yes, you have to walk through or around the patio to the get to the front door. The service is good but the hostess can stand to learn some customer service skills. But all that aside, we really enjoy Intermezzo. They have pizza and Serbian food. Yup. That's right... One strange combination but it works!

We've tried the pizza (excellent!) and the Serbian dishes (BEEF BUREK FTW!). I also love places that bring you freshly grated parm. It's entered the rotation as a usual spot!
I left this place with hair on both my legs upper and lower. I ended up spending three and half hours there and once I realized how much hair I still had I was pretty upset but didn't have the time to stay and have her fix it. There was scrapes on my legs from where she tried to get the remaining wax off with tweezers. Super young and very unprofessional. I would never go back, not even to have her fix the crappy job she did.
This place is very clean and modern looking. Unfortunately seating was a bit tight, I wish they would take a table out to give the place a bit more space, but then the place is quite small in the first place. At most it can seat around 15 customers. They have many pastries available, from Croissant to Pain Au Chocolate. I was really interested in trying this pastry called "8", which had a lightly brûlée vanilla custard. In addition, they offer macarons and pretty little cakes - like Mont Blanc, lemon tart.

My orders: 
-Lemon Tart: was very refreshing and the acidity level was just right!. The ratio of the shortbread crust to lemon curd was perfect. In my opinion, if you are looking for something that is not as sweet as the Pistache, the lemon tart is a great option!

-Pistache: was a little too sweet for my likings. The crust was flaky and adds a great crunchy texture to the pistachio filling. In my opinion the pistachio filling was a bit too creamy and the pistachio flavor was very subtle, I wish the flavor was a bit stronger. That being said, there are some layers of hidden raspberry jam between the pistachio cream and it really helps cut down the creaminess of the pistachio.

-Macarons (Earl Grey, Oolong, Green tea): The texture of these macarons was good. The Matcha and Oolong flavors really came through, except for the Earl Grey. They were a tad too sweet in my opinion, it was too much that I had to drink water or tea to wash down the sweetness in my throat..

-The 8: my favourite! It's like eating those Asian egg tart, except this one shaped like number 8. The texture was lovely and not too sweet at all :).
My favorite Brazilian restaurant here!! I'm Brazilian and since moving here I've tried a few places out but this one place is just perfection.
They have everything a restaurant needs to have to be good, AMAZING food, a nice and cozy space and really friendly staff. You will feel home!
So they have many options for appetizers, main meals, pizzas and deserts (and they have Guaraná!). It's a must try if you want to try Brazilian food or if you're looking for a new restaurant! 
We come here often for the sausage with onions (comes with white rice, beans, fries and a salad). You can also add fried eggs for really cheap. And for their brigadeiros! Highly recommend it!
The food was extremely bland, and actually the worst Thai I've had here in Arizona.  Won ton weren't impressive.  The noodle soup tasted as if if consisted almost solely of (canned\/boxed) chicken broth with no added spice or flavor.   Attempts to doctor it just made it too salty, so I am pretty sure it was an everyday high-sodium canned chicken broth, and not a boiled chicken stock.  Service was okay.  Parking is fine.  I won't be back.
It's a pub... nice and clean one.

Came here to grab some food with the girls since the Thai place below was an hour wait. We stuck with the normal pub food: burgers, fries and grilled cheese sandwich.

The burger presentation was great - it comes with fries and some onion rings piled on top. It was a decent burger.

Girlfriend got the grilled cheese sandwich with bacon - which she said was good.

When looking at the menu - there are so many options to choose from... especially with the pictures they include. The only thing is the pictures always look better then the real thing. The Sheppard's pie looked so yummy but when we saw another table get it, it didn't look so appealing.
While the food was decent at Pollo Campero, I was pretty displeased with the service. In the middle of us ordering, the girl at the register started talking to another employee (in Spanish, not sure what they were saying, but they were laughing) for a solid 45 seconds. I found this incredibly rude to talk to another employee in the middle of our order.

I had high hopes for Pollo Campero, as every time I drove past it, I could see cars wrapping around the drive through. I realize now it is because they have inefficient work. It took about 15-20 minutes to get it our food, which is surprising for a fast food place.

The food was decent. Everyone suggests the empanadas, which I agree are a good choice. The chicken was juicy, but the bowls were lacking some spice--pretty bland.

Overall, I will probably not be returning to Pollo Campero. El Pollo Loco is cheaper, faster, and tastier.
One word. Charlotte. That's all I can say about this place.

I have a very picky hair and usually have no time to do any styling. If it's not cut right, it will become as frizzy as it can get and I would end up looking like cave men. Charlotte gave it some layers with bangs and I never have to style my hair until the next haircut. That's what usually happens after 3(or was it 4?) times having my hair cut by her. I get addicted to my hair automatically style itself, so I'm definitely returning for more. For the amount of money they're charging, this place is so worth it.
Same experience as other posters I agreed to pay the cars.com advertised price only to find out after they get your credit information and take your deposit that the price is at least $1,400 more in hidden fees. They charge $1,000 if you pay cash and don't take their high interest loan and $400 in dealer fees. None of which is on the cars.com advertisement.
I previously purchased my flooring from the Chandler\/Gilbert Location.  It has held up well, so I can vouch for their laminate's quality.  However, this location is understaffed, which seems to have led to a decline in customer service.

They definitely need to have more people on the sales floor, preferably equipped with excellent customer service training.
Surprise! 

Not having a look at any review on this business I assumed it was just a small little hole in the wall with maybe 10 people max seating.. I was off by a mile, with a nice European style bar and outdoor patio with large seating areas this is a little hide away that wasn't expected.

Order a nice deep dish pizza with meatball app. The food and service was great and somewhere I'll come back too

Overall
Food: 4-5
Drink: 3-5
Service: 4-5
Coming back: yes
Great atmosphere and attentive staff. The ramen was good. The pork belly was lacking in proportion to the size of the ramen bowl and the cost. I enjoyed the experience, however I will continue to explore Charlotte eateries before making a trip back.
I stayed in Saint-Henri a few years ago and was surprised to find few options for affordable, tasty food. Things on Notre-Dame have changed quite a bit since then, with the opening of Adamo, Arthur's Nosh Bar, Lupita and co. TRAN is the new kid on the block, a pho restaurant set in a clean, black & white room. The menu reflects the minimalistic space, with a handful of pho and rice choices. If you're a fan of tripe or brisket you won't be able to eat it here though, as the limited menu only offers rare beef, flank or chicken pho. 

I ordered the rare beef. The restaurant is affiliated with the excellent Pho Tay Ho in Rosemont, so I sort of expected the soup to be tasty. It was, however my beef was never rare or even medium rare- either it arrived fully cooked or the scorching hot broth cooked it in seconds. 

I knocked off another star because of the price and the fact that they use plastic cups. I'm sure most pho connaisseurs would agree- the price is a bit steep for a bowl that's very similar to what you'd get in Chinatown. You might argue that you're paying extra to eat in a clean and visually pleasing environment, but I could suggest a few places that are cheaper and still meet those criteria. 

Nevertheless, if you're in the area, it's not a bad place to stop by.
Stay away 
.far away.  This business is a Groupon business.  She has no regular clients.  She will void your Groupon unfairly.  She's a scammer.  Gets paid by Groupon and will find any excuse to kick you out the door.  You could have a death in the family...she'll say...NOT MY PROBLEM...YOUVE BEEN VOIDED.   The she's got another victim lined up.  Ignorant witch
Raku is exquisite and delicious. Japanese food presented passionately without compromise.
Came here with a group of 20 after they had their poker night. 

Everything on their menu was fried, fried, and more fried.  Not one healthy item!

And I was a bit afraid to drink the water they served me cause I wasn't  sure if the cup was clean since quite a few of the plates the waitress brought out for the appetizers were dirty.

The upside was the waitress was friendly and the company I was with was fun.

Def would not come here on my own or be one of my choices if I was the organizer!
This is the socially awkward and shy person's dream come true.  Self serve yogurt and toppings with limited interaction with people.  I am one of those shy folks and I love that I can go get some delicious blueberry tart yogurt, add some vanilla wafer yogurt and pay without having to say anything more than 'no I don't want the receipt.'
For a 24 hour cafe, this is great and always wonderful, friendly service! The fish and chips are delicious! Check my picture of them!  Be sure and try a Danish with an espresso as well!
Avant de commencer....laissez-moi clarifier que j'ai été dîner  là car j'ai vu qu'il y avait un menu midi à très  bon prix (selon leur pencarte extérieure), que je travaille à quelques mètres  de là...et que je suis une yelpeuse qui aime connaître des nouveaux endroits..! 

Bon maintenant que tout est clarifié, je vais vous faire mon reviews par rapport au lieu et à la nourriture  et non aux danseuses..car même  si tout être humain  est beau...j'aime les garçons .  

Le menu(style table d'hôte: soupe ou salade et un désert)  change à chaque jour! Il est de 11h à 21h. Il y a un spécial sur un verre de bière à 3$ entre 11h et 14h (on aime ça!).  Le menu est quand même  très variés (la journée  où  j'ai été). Et il y a un plat qui se nomme " En cas que.."... En cas que je ne sais pas pourquoi...mais bref cette journée là c'était  des quesadillas au steak avec crème  sûre  et salsa on the side. J'ai pris la salade comme entrée. Une salade très abondante avec sûrement  de la sauce Style italienne de kraft...mais étonnamment  bonne.  Les quesadillas...wow!! Je ne sais pas quel type il a pris son steak mais c'était tendre!! Il était en plus saignant. Les quarts de quesadilla étaient très garni  et les frites  wow délicieuses. Et en passant la porte de la cuisine était ouverte  quand on est rentré..et le tout à d'l'air très propre! Comme désert, il y avait un gâteau  très  simple à la vanille, mais délicieux avec du nutella fondu sur le dessus...moi qui n'aime pas le sucré!! Attention je vous dévoile le prix de ses trois services. ......RRRRRRROULEMENT DE TAMBOURS!!! UN GROS 10.75$ tseeee..non mais à ce prix là j'aimerai  y aller tous les jours...mais je garde ma dignité..ça reste  quand même  un bar de danseuses et je ne suis pas la clientèle  cible. Ah btw, il y a un menu fast food...avec hamburger..pogo.. poutine...ailes de poulet...etc....etc qui reste  là tous les jours.

Bon après  vous avoir commenté de nourriture, parlons de l'endroit! Je suis rentré  avec mon ami (qui en passant a été quand même  souvent en soirée, mais qu'il n'a jamais mangé là). Il y avait le doorman, le monsieur  a demandé  un prix d'entrée\/pourboire à notre discrétion...Je lui ai donné 10$...et mon ami m'a ensuite dit...normalement tu donne 2$ en plus il nous à même  pas amener  à notre table etc etc...bref...je vais le savoir la prochaine fois!

L'endroit est sombre  pour me midi...mais on s'entend ça reste un club de danseuses. Il doit y avoir beaucoup  plus d'ambiance durant le soir ça c'est sûre ! Les danseuses étaient ok...selon moi un peu plate ...mais bon  c'est  le midi....Mais elles  étaient belles! Le service est  très  rapide, la serveuse  de  l'alcool et de la nourriture  sont très  gentilles  et on bien répondu  à nos questions. En étant la seule femme comme cliente pendant que j'ai été, je ne me suis aucunement  senti jugée  ou même  pas à ma place. Que ce soit par le staff ou par la clientèle.

BREF...GENS OUVERT D'ESPRIT  ET QUI AIMENT DE LA NOURRITURE  PAS CHER...JE VOUS LE RECOMMANDE!
I just got my license today and Chet had me so well prepared that when I took the driving test I was calm and relaxed. He taught me exactly what I needed to know. His written study material is excellent. I passed my written test with no wrong answers. I was very nervous when I started driving, but Chet is very calm and supportive. He made me feel that I could handle everything. He's a wonderful teacher and a joy to spend time with. I will miss working with him. Helene Hensen
Finally ventures to the strip and tried this for a quick dinner prior a concert. A+
Enjoyed the staff's interaction and must admit that 'video recorder' had my friend recording a few lol. It's in the bar area do trust me- go for it and have fun.
Our food a tasty and the birthday cake shot was my favorite! Another spot in addition for the restaurant at at The Cosmopolitan!
Not a bad park at all. The canal path is great to run along and is usually pretty open during the early mornings on weekends. As it gets nice out, it can be filled with bikers, runners and walkers alike.

One downfall, the few times I've tried to stretch on some patches of grass, I've had some unexpected and unpleasant encounters with ants. Stretch on the sidewalk please!!
Since this place is known to be a churrascaria I will start my review off with the meats. I am not a fan of "sweet meats" aka a meat with any kind of sweet glaze on it. When I went for Sunday brunch the offerings were sausage, flank, and ham. The grilled pineapple--sweet enough already--also had a sweet cinnamon glaze on it. 

The only redeeming quality were the fresh salad bar and fruits. They also had Wisconsin cheese offerings, nuts, and pastries. Sadly the pastries seemed to have come out of a box from Costco. There was also a buffet of scrambled eggs, bacon, and potatoes. I was really unimpressed by this place but I enjoyed getting my fill of cheap pastries, salad, and potatoes.

Decor was nice. I tried booking a reservation through Open Table but the restaurant wasn't available through the website. Odd.

Was it worth the $15? Meh. Will I be back? Probably--to try the lunch\/dinner but probably not for brunch. After all I wasn't able to sample their entire selection of meats.
I'm sad to say that while I started out really enjoying Sushi Eye, lately I haven't been such a big fan. I still adore the atmosphere and I love the vibe there. It's never packed and I always feel at ease and relaxed, the feeling I should feel when enjoying sushi. 

However, I'm not that impressed by the rolls... not sure what it's been the past two times, but they seem not up to par with what I remember and not quite as worth the cost as I thought. It could be that most of them are too fancy and lack the mix of sophistication and simplicity that I look for when I am out for sushi. It could also be that once again, I was missing the resting place for my chopsticks. 

I should try it again, to see if my luck improves any but two out of the past three times, I have left only feeling mediocre.
Solid tacos and chips\/salsa. Was in Phoenix for business and went here twice. All local draft beer, which was very good. Sat at the bar so I can't comment on the table service, but the bar servers were on the ball. Would definitely go back.
Ok, so it's been a while due to lack of customer service, and guess what? It strikes again. 

First, our order was messed up. Ok, they fixed it, but only after struggling to find someone else since our server mysteriously vanished.

Then, we tried to order some more drinks. Where did our server go? Oh, I see him. I made eye contact, and got ignored. I made eye contact and waved at several people, still no service. After finally getting a response (from the 4th person) our drinks are ordered. Do they come? No. Does the guy sitting next to me who ordered the same drink after me get his first? Yes.

I then went to the owner, who tried to tell me that there were only 2 servers working. As someone who has been a server and restaurant manager for 10+ years, I notice everything in the restaurant.  Everything. Especially the fact that there were 5 servers, 3 bussers, 2 managers, and when I'm being blatantly ignored and lied to. After talking to the owner and explaining all of this, his response was, "what do you want me to do about it?" Really? That's the response? I was appalled. I said you could work on customer service & satisfaction, he did give 2 Thai teas, but with much dissatisfaction and making me feel like an unwanted customer the entire conversation.
I've returned a few times since my last review and I must say WOW. 

You walk in and are greeting by the lovely owners. The restaurant has a peaceful atmosphere built by the perfect lighting and wonderful Tibetan music. Sometimes they even play buddhist chants which are absolute perfection. 

The menu has changed a bit; they've trimmed it down which is great because they're offering up their freshest and best. 
I can't stay away from their momos which a light and heavenly. Their food has been much better than what I wrote in my previous review; much more flavourful. They also seem to have solved the speed of service issue that I mentioned in my previous review. 

If you're going with a group you must get the large lower seating that they have; it's absolutely charming.

I would seriously recommend this place it's charming and the food is perfection.
Shake Shack is fair. That's the best way I can describe it. The service is good here. Inside is very clean and it doesn't take long to get your order. I got the smoke shack burger. Again, it was fair. 
The shake was excellent, probably the best thing here. I went with the strawberry, great choice. I might have to come and try it again, and maybe I'll have a better feeling about it.
Forgive my ineptitude with South Indian food, but I didn't really know what a Dosa was. But if you asked me if I wanted a humongous, oversized, flavoured, savory crepe filled with your choice of spicy and intriguing filing, I'd say "yes please!". And that, my Yelp friends, is what a dosa is. 

This comically large crepe dish (seriously, look at my pic, it's the size of a small baseball bat) was crisp yet soft, and had a bit of heat from chile oil. The filling was a mix of tofu and veggies which was well spiced. 

The side sauces were great, my favourite being some sort of tomato puree which I ran through quickly as I mopped up the filling and sauce with my crepe-like awesomeness.

I also had the watermelon juice which was fresh and tasty, but I'd ask for extra ice to get it nice and cold. Super refreshing during the heat wave.

All in all, a great meal for $10! Vegetarian isn't normally my food of choice, but I'm a new fan of dosas, so I'll be back!
Really liked this place!  I came here for the Rock Star Beer Fest (only a bummer because they ran out of beer and wine so quickly!), and really liked the vibe of the place.  Definitely plan on coming back here - and I'll swim, then!
Nearly the worst pizza experience I've had since dining in my elementary school cafeteria. The pizza was extremely soggy, presumably from the canned mushrooms they did not drain properly before throwing them on the pie. Based on the previous reviews, I expected fresh, quality ingredients but nothing on our pizza really fit that description. One really cool thing about Mitty's is that they make and market their own hot sauces, but it's not that cool - the "hot" was very very hot but one-dimensional in flavor (just hot; boring). I will say that the non-pizza foods we saw being delivered around us *looked* pretty good, especially the mac and cheese. It was also seemingly clean and our server was nice!
This is a must when "touring" Cleveberg, a total landmark restaurant! The place has been putting out obscenely large pastrami (and corned beef) sandwich's for years. Go if you dare but go hungry. Puts many NYC joints to shame. Ask for extra pickles you will need them.
I stop by and leave a pint every few months. People need it and it is good for you to donate blood. It keeps the blood nice and thin. The staff is very friendly here and they are very professional. Stop by and donate!! People need your blood.
I've come here with my boyfriend twice now and both times the food and atmosphere have been wonderful. Last time we had the Funghi pizza and last night we had the Sopressatta pizza. The Funghi was definitely our favorite. The crust isn't too crispy like with a lot of brick oven pizzas-just the right amount of chewy and crispy. The BLT salad is delicious, although the roasted tomatoes were a little too roasted for me last night. They loved their candied bacon...we thought it was okay-a little too sweet for us. They have awesome beer choices and the bartender is honest about what's good and legitimately wants you to have a good time. I think we will make this a regular spot for us!
Our furry members of the family know and love both Meg and Laura.  Laura walks our dog and has been cat sitting for us when we are away for a number of years now.  Now when we come home our cat isn't stressed out but is really happy to see us.  She and Meg are highly capable and care deeply about the animals that they take care of.  I would highly recommend them and so would Lilly and Eva (if they could talk)!
If you know what you're getting into, then this is a great place. I recommend it for couples, families, seniors, and those who want to avoid the crowds on the strip. 

The hotel is "good enough". You will find that everything is just good enough. Bingo, slots, tables, sportsbook, food, pool, everything is good enough.  Ate at the buffet and the 'prime rib' restaurant. Everything was average. 16 screen theatre, 24hr bowling center.

The room don't have mini fridges (extra $15 a day) which sucks. $8 shuttle takes you to the strip (10 minutes). Shuttle stops at 12am.

Drinks were cheap. $18 for a beer, 2 shots, and a mixed drink at the bar. Overall, I enjoyed myself here. If you want strip action avoid. If this is your first time in vegas go to the strip instead. Otherwise, this place is a great value ($80 a night).
Convenient drive-through location that delivered a tasty beverage. No complaints.
Went again on Monday night - both dishes were amazing once again.  The consistency will keep me returning!
Much better this time around! We sat at a table, not the bar, and our service was excellent. She was totally on point and super friendly.. what a relief ;)

I tried the seafood sub and wasn't crazy about it. Lacked a lot of flavor in my opinion. The hubs ordered the mussels again of course, and loved them just as much this time around. Regardless of my lack-of-love for my food, our faith has been restored in the staff at here, and we'll definitely be back.
Already having a fossil watch, I naturally returned to see what they had to offer in their smart watch selection. I purchased a smart watch at a different location because I wanted something with style.  I tried it out over the weekend and it just didn't do it for me. I returned it to this location without any issues. The customer service was great and very helpful.
For those of you who want something in a smart watch with more style than a generic square, I was told a style upgrade was due near October. I'll be back for that!
George showed up on time and had all the tools and materials to do the work. He is a very pleasant person and did not waste any time.  I highly recommend George for any household projects you might have.  I had George do some concrete clean up and painting was very pleased with the results!
Me and Cerreta's have got some history. Probably because I grew up in Glendale, which is filled with boring suburbs of cookie cutter homes surrounded by six foot concrete security gates that house dysfunctional 2.5 kiddo families and promote a sense of community as deep as a valley girl's vocabulary.

So any time we visited cutesy pootsy downtown Glendale it was a memorable experience.

I've toured the factory multiple times and regardless of age, childlike glee paints the face of every person in the tour group. You'll be thrilled by chocolate rivers, marshmallow clouds, edible buttercups and small orange creatures with violent green hair and a penchant for bursting into songs that have afterschool special messages tacked onto the end. Well not really, but it's as close to Willy Wonka as you're getting here in the Valley.

Free tours on the half hour and sampling to your heart's content! Try the rectangular green ones. They're mint truffles and arguably the best I've had. Eat it Andes!! But I'm biased. I grew up with Cerreta. I stole their individually wrapped chocolates from the bins at Bashas. I went to high school with their daughter Candy--who's as sweet as her namesake. I'm a die hard fan of these home grown chocolatiers, and there isn't any other place I'd rather go to rekindle a bit of childhood nostalgia.

It's good family fun, a great date idea, or a nice distraction for the babysitters\/aunties\/grandmas out there (cuz you'll want to give the kids back right after they o'd on sugar).

You do get an unlabeled grab bag when you purchase a mixture of chocolates, but just channel the ingenuity of the young. Poke a hole in the bottom of each one with your finger. Viola! Problem solved!
I've had good experiences here and terrible ones.

Today my co-worker went to pick up my order. I'd ordered a tall Pike's Pace with a shot of espresso, but they made me a Grande Chestnut Praline Latte....which I don't like.
No one that I'd ordered with had chosen a drink even remotely similar, so we have no idea how this drink came to be my order.

The week of Christmas 2016, Starbucks was running a special of 1\/2 off a holiday drink with the purchase of a holiday sandwich. However, the person I was ordering from didn't know what my sandwich was that I was ordering, so I had to choose a different one, and then I did not get the 50% off my drink.
I went here for a Christmas party with fellow staff members. All-in-all, no complaints. It's seems like your basic dive bar, with plenty of local colour and regulars thrown into the mix. 
We had a "party room" of sorts, which was in the basement and was pretty basic, although it had a TV and fireplace and a sound system that allowed us to hook up someone's ipod. The small, square shape and rectangular tables left limited space for mingling though. The set up could have been better. 
Drinks were good and overall food was good, didn't see anything amazing though. I ordered schnitzel, which was fine. The mushroom gravy on top was amazing though, so make sure you go for that when offered. Quite out of the way for me though, so unless there is a party, I wouldn't be going out of my way to go back. Overall, good stuff though!
We decided, that since First Friday was lame, we would go grab a nice steak at Outback. Let me just say that the ONLY reason this review is 4 stars and not 1 is because of Jennifer, the manager who was on duty. My husband and I walked into the restaurant at around 8:50pm. We were seated immediately. Within 2 minutes our server was at the table taking drink orders. She brought out drinks ASAP and then took our order. Our entire order. We ordered 1 appetizer and our main courses all at once. 30 minutes for our appetizer to come out. Another 20 for our main course. At this point, it was 9:35pm. The restaurant closes at 10pm. When our server finally brought out meal I asked to speak to the manager. Jennifer can over to our table. All I had to say was "50 minutes". The place was dead. There was no reason for our order to have taken FIFTY MINUTES!! But Jennifer was awesome. She comped our entire meal. It's refreshing when a manger sees that her team dropped the ball and made no excuses. Thank you. Jennifer is a keeper. The food was good. Good enough to to warrant a return trip. I got the flat iron steak and shrimp. The steak was grilled to perfection. The shrimp was a little overdone. The salad that came with the meal was non-descript. Iceberg lettuce with some tomatoes, cucumber, and shredded cheese with the dressing kind of dumped in the middle. Hubby got the French dip. Meh. Nothing to write home about on that one. No. Here it's about the steak. And that was worth returning for.
The doctor has a very nice and attentive service. The glasses selection is minimal. I came in for the Groupon exam and was happy to take my prescription to Pearle Vision where they have walls of glasses to choose from.
It's been a while since I've been here. Walked in the door and they started to speak  English to me.... that's odd. Then we sat down.... they brought us forks...... what the hell is going on? We never get forks, who the hell uses forks? So now they assume everyone doesn't know Chinese and uses forks? I was really offended by the forks.   Looked around, I see people with forks, sodas, cold water glasses, hot mustard, tables with no tea, and people actually ordering the plates of noodles (the stuff you never buy at dim sum.) 

Not to sound racist but I saw mostly white and Filipino people in here. Maybe some Hawaiians. I felt like the only Chinese. Did not hear anybody say Jo-san.  What the hell is going on? There are a lot of non-Chinese yelping going on too. Lot's of 5 stars, that's weird. 

You know if a Chinese restaurant is good if there are bad ratings for things like:
-rude dim sum cart ladies
-or they forgot my water,
-or they forgot my hot mustard, 
-they don't have orange chicken
-they don't speak english
-there's leaves in my tea
-they circle dishes of food around my face saying, "you want this teriyaki bullshit on plate?" 


Really forks?
My wife is Thai and cooks amazing Thai food at home. This is basically the only Thai restaurant that she is willing to go to, even though there are several options that are closer. That might be all you need to know.

Huge menu with an entire page dedicated to Northern Thai Isaan food. Very spicy. Prices are a bit steep but portions are big. For four people, price came out to $85 with tip, no dessert.
Met friends here this past week. Sat at the bar area. Service was good. Drinks were outstanding, the food was just ok. Good place to meet friends.
I had stayed at the Mandalay Bay in the past and was quite happy with those experiences. I found an amazing rate for The Hotel so i had to try it out. I really like the more secluded entrance. The check in process was quick and they make you feel important. 

The rooms are nice suites. Modern styling adorns the rooms. These are nice rooms. Not to the level of Wynn or Venetian, but only a few steps behind. My only complaint about the room is petty, but it was annoying. The clothes iron was tied to the ironing board. It made it difficult to iron my clothes. This is not a Motel Six, i should not have to fight a security cord on my iron. 

The Hotel area is a nice separation from the main portion of Mandalay Bay. The area has its own bar, store and amenities. It is nice to have the ability to step away from the mega casino feel for a few minutes.
I went in with low expectations and was still disappointed.  Dry and bland everything.  Tries to be a cheap-ish place and then charges ridiculous prices. Everything on the menu costs 2-3 times more than it should.
Ooh, nice! You know somewhere's ok when they deliver your friend a drink with a clockwork monkey on a string. Chessboard floor, plenty of seating, nice downstairs by the looks of things and an efficient, if taciturn, water.

What I really liked was that the instant anyone arrived, the waiter appeared with a weeny tumbler of water to drink while a harder option was decided upon (or not-so-hard, in my case).

There's not much in the way of a written menu - just a price list with names and prices, so you'd have to enquire. I think the idea is you pick one - like a lucky dip, hence the name. That's my guess anyway. I requested a mocktail and was asked not what kind of flavour I'd like, which is the usual question, but what I'd like to avoid. Heh. Interesting. No bananas, please, I say, and off he zooms to create something for me.

Well, full marks for the not-banana. It definitely didn't have any of that in it. Also no coffee or lamb, so we're on a winner here, folks. All the same, it didn't knocktail my socktails off; it seemed to me more like just bitter lemon with a mint sprig. That said, it was very mature - not that sweet and fruity - and lots of lovely crushed ice to play with afterward. Also, it only cost £3.50. Huzzah!
Came in late afternoon, after lunch but before dinner.  As a single diner, it's interesting to see how good service is.  One person eats apps faster than a group of people, and usually, should be a priority when sending food out.  There was only another couple eating there and the decor was semi-formal, with five lovely chandeliers and red tablecloths on all tables.  Asian music was playing in the background, something I really enjoyed.  (I feel like ethnically appropriate music enhances the dining experience.)  

The service was great and the staff friendly.  My water glass was never empty, and the waiter was attentive and prompt.  Courses came out in a timely manner, and by the time the main course was served (lemongrass curry with shrimp and potatoes), I was stuffed on spring rolls, both fresh and fried.  The shrimp were large and thoroughly deveined, (something I'm picky about), and perfectly cooked and tender.  The portions were large, and I had plenty leftover for lunch today.  

A great experience, can't wait to go back.
Short version: the "cleaning" on an empty house was performed so poorly that we'll never use this service again and highly recommend anyone we know against using them. 

Long version: our house was completely empty after having moved out and we wanted a nice and shiny place for the new buyers to move into. We needed a general and thorough cleaning for sure, but there was nothing major to get cleaned up. After they said they came by to clean the place (we weren't there) we stopped by, and it looked atrocious. Our stainless appliances were worse off than we left them, like they were cleaned with greasy rags. While it looked like something was dragged all over the carpets, the place still needed a vacuum - maybe theirs was full or clogged or not operating, because it certainly didn't pick anything up. Tile and linoleum floors weren't mopped, and may or may not have been swept. Our guest bathroom was completely ignored - a seldom used toilet had cloudy water sitting in it - they didn't even flush it. 

We spoke with the supervisor to express our dissatisfaction and he scheduled a re-clean for the following afternoon, which was the day we signed the final sale agreement. We stopped by after the appointed time (3:30-4:30), noting that nothing had been fixed. The supervisor claimed our appointment time was in fact later and the crew was going to be on their way shortly. I get that scheduling conflicts happen, but when you have text messages clearly stating an appointment time, you really can't expect an already upset customer to believe anything but that the appointment was forgotten. 

We requested a full refund for the $210 charge and were offered only a $30 refund - we're out $180, our home sale is completed, and our home looks like crap for the new buyers. 

We had a pleasant experience with this service once before and decided to use them again - never again. An opportunity to correct their mistake was handled very poorly, and their desire to make sure we were satisfied was nonexistent.
Kind of a hike to get here, and a little hidden, but a pretty adorable place with some great finds. If I had more rooms to decorate or was in the middle of buying a new place right now I'd so be all over this. Hell, there was even a hot pink petticoat. 

The owner was so nice and even makes and refinishes her own vintage jewelry. I ended up walking out with two necklaces, one of which was made of real pink pearls.
This place is right across the street from us and we did not want to cook! 
It's a little hole in the wall and the space is not that big, but it was welcoming and comfortable. The language barrier is a little difficult but not too hard. I ordered 3 tacos (chicken, al pastor, and barbacoa), she asked if I wanted onions and cilantro and I said yes. We ordered it to go, and she said it would take about 15 minutes. 

When we got it home (she included a green sauce) we laid it all out. I squeezed the lime on top and added a little sauce. The flavors of these tacos are AMAZINGGG!! The green sauce had a little kick to it that I was not expecting, but still so good!!

This is my new taco spot! I cannot wait to try the other tacos!
Warning: Do not attempt to eat this on a day you are watching your diet. However, everyone needs an off day don't they?

I went years before realizing El Coquito was within walking distance of my office. And it didn't take more than a few days before we were dying to try it once we found out. 

El Coquito is kinda tucked away in an old plaza off of McDowell on Granite Reef. The inside has a nice homey feel to it. Various tables of different sizes, pictures on the wall, a TV playing some good ol' futbol. We arrived 5 minutes before the website said they open, and we weren't even the first ones there. Fair warning, that you may want to give yourself time as the place is small and appears to fill up fast.

Be assured though, that the service is still top notch. We were greeted promptly and our food came quickly and just as ordered. I ordered the mofongo with pork and an unleaded coquito. And for the half hour I sat and savored that meal, I was completely overcome with bliss. The textures were great, everything was the right consistency and temperature and the flavors were amazing. Be prepared for the high garlic content, especially if you use the extra garlic that comes on the side, which I did. May want to wait while before smooching anyone. 

Highly recommended, and a place I know I will be back to on various occasions. For those wanting to go with a group of friends or coworkers, splitting the bill was no issue.
Not a fan.  Spending a lot of time in Chandler, I have been trying to find some good places to shop other than the mall.  This shopping center will not be in the rotation.  

It's set up a little differently, more urban-like I guess, but it's the same old shopping and restaurant chains.  Dillard's is an "anchor", but I'm never that impressed with them.  Macy's is on the way, which is slightly better I guess.  Parking is a pain.  Not an easy in, shop, out....but what strip mall is, right?

The only plus is that the stores are somewhat organized into teeny-boppers and adults, meaning that when I wanted to hit up Banana Republic, White House\/Black Market, and Ann Taylor they were right next to each other.  

I'd much rather shop at Dana Park Village Square, which at least has some non-chain stores and lots of easy parking.  If I want the department stores, I'll head to the mall.
When Turntable first opened, they were FANTASTIC! However, they have now gone the way of every other health care provider in the valley. Forget about reaching anyone or having any request taken care of in a timely manner. Used to be able to get same-day appointments - now I have to wait weeks to see anyone.  Some of the health coaches there seem to be sullen and angry - about what I'm not sure, but they are certainly not "coaches" any more. Now I see my primary doctor - Dr. Gokal - has left. He was wonderful. So now I'm wondering why I'm paying $80 a month to get the same level of "service" I can get from any other health care provider here in Las Vegas.
Great Mexican food and drinks at great prices. I live right down the street, and I've enjoyed everything from sitting at the bar and ordering togo, to dining in with friends and family. The staff is very friendly and attentive. I've never tried it, but they also have a patio for those that enjoy outdoor dining. It would probably be the best place to enjoy a frozen strawberry margarita. Yum!
Loud. Decent dishes, decent drinks, decent desserts. They do special combos and deals quite frequently. Ideal for bigger groups. 

The decor was one of the things that was memorable about this place. Very retro yet traditional. Nudity all over the men's  washroom if you're into that.
Sushi Roku has the most amazing service.  We sat at the sushi bar and Toby was fantastic.  Our server Kenji was quite attentive.  Special kudos go to the manager Fan.  He did a fantastic job helping go through the saki menu and explaining everything.  They all knew the menu so well.  Truly an amazing experience!
Disclaimer: please take a glance of the pictures I posted from the other evening at this theater.  
As the saying goes: a picture is worth a thousand words.  Well. These a numerous pictures and perhaps no words and a jaw dropping expression instead. 
A friend and myself were a bit confused about the popcorn situation. 
However, it kept snowballing downhill when we went to sit on a seat in the theater! Three rows of checking the seats prior sitting on one!
Filthy seats, beyond dirty.  Time for some reupholstering I think. 
Two stars, because the lovely lady who took our tickets was exactly as stated: lovely. The fellow at the ticket counter when purchasing was informative and had a gleaming smile. 
That's all folks;) 
Wait, that's not all- opt for another theater please:)
Wow has this location gone downhill. Went about a month ago, and the place was in the process of a renovation and just seemed dirty.  (Child's seat was disgustingly sticky...) Service was fine, albeit slow for the type of restaurant.  Food was serviceable.  Prices were up from previous visits and the serving of fries smaller (which doesn't make a difference since they'll bring you more, but suggests an attempt to cost-contain).  We're unlikely to return.
Sahara has every average fast food chain, it's awash I. The typical stereotypes- until now!
I first came upon The Hummus Factory at the Foodie Fest when I first moved here two years ago.  Truth be told, I only went for White Castle.  That's correct, White Castle born and raised on it! I'm from Long Island or 'Lawn Gyland' ha!
Now, the first item I tried from The Hummus Factory food truck (yes, in NY these are called 'something else' insert laughing emoji please) was the eggplant fries and instantly became addicted. I then ordered three more orders that day and brought them home. My other favorite is baba Ganosh- it's damn tasty here!
My third favorite- Greek Burger.  
This will now be a weekly stop for me!
Had lamb kabaab, kadhai chicken. Both are very tasty...! Remembered Hyderabadi Spicy food!
I'll keep this simple and sweet.

Without fail, it takes three to four phone calls to actually get through to someone to place an order. Then most of the time I get thrown on hold for over 15mins or even hung up on. I live in a two mile radius of this store and delivery takes a good hour to an hour and half.

Not sure what the deal is here but this store never seems to have a line up out front, so I'm a little confused as to why they struggle.

When we get the pizza it's actually not so bad. 
Tried it a few times and won't order again. There are too many other good pizza joints close by
Service was stellar. The waiter was very kind and the atmosphere was great! It put a smile on my face. It took less than 5 minutes to get seated and less than 10 minutes to have our order taken. Within 2 minutes of having our order taken, the soup we ordered came out. The main entree came out in a timely fashion as well.

Items I ordered were:
Three Cheese & Ale Soup
Stuffed Poblano Pepper
Cajun-Style Shrimp Po' Boy

The soup was overall very delicious. It was a bit salty but the creamy consistency was amazing and the bacon and green onions really gave the dish some nice texture and crunch. The soup also had a slight bitterness which was good as well. I highly recommend this dish. 

The stuffed pepper had great flavor but lacked texture. The potato and cheese filling was a bit mushy and the pepper being mushy as well didn't help. I wish the pepper had a bit more crunchy texture to accompany the creaminess of the potato and cheese. The sauce was great and had a nice flavor with some heat. The rice and corn was delicious as well. I probably wouldn't recommend this dish. 

The po' boy was pretty good. The bread was toasted well and gave the sandwich a nice crunch. Shrimp was a bit overcooked and the veggies were kind of just slammed together in some sauce. However, flavor was there. I took a risk in ordering a Louisiana style dish here and it didn't really hit the mark. I would still recommend this dish nonetheless. 

I was going to give this place 3 stars but the service is what made this place shine. Therefore, 4 stars it is! Overall, not a bad experience and would come back.
I work in the heart of downtown and tried Sushi 86 for the first time. The smoked salmon maki box is delish. I ordered pick up but wish I had dined in. The aesthetic is really nice. All white. Very sterile. But in a good way. I'll definitely be back.
Ordered takeout for lunch at work.  Not a quick order place, as it took quite a while to get my food.  Definitely overpriced (for $12.50 your sandwich better be amazing).  Inedibly hard undercooked potatoes (I really hated these).  Lackluster monte cristo sandwich which I ended up just taking apart and eating in layers.  Haven't been back since.

They definitely cater to "the regulars" and don't seem interested in attracting new business.  They better take heed.  Karsh's next door closed for a reason...

I'll stick with braving the parking lot and traffic for Miracle Mile.  It's much easier to zip through their cafeteria line, and their food quality is much higher.
I'll get straight to the point.

Thursday Special $1.50 Oysters - they were not the worst oysters I have ever had, but they were not exactly plump and sweet. They were what you would expect from a bar.

Mussels- the absolute worst mussels I have ever been served. The mussels were so small they were not even worth eating. The shells were broken into small pieces. I was shocked that they served them to me.

Crab Cakes - definitely not lump crab and they were cold.

My expectations were not high to begin with, but com' on man. You can't serve people that kind of mess. That was a waste of $67.00. I was better off on my first trip when they were closed. Very disappointing.
First things first - I am a road cyclist and a spin class junkie (though I prefer the term "aficionado"). Last week, I posted the following to my Facebook status after yet another predictably boring YMCA spin class, "If 90+% of your class has us out of the saddle or doing ridiculous 'jumps', it's not a cycle class. It's an elliptical class. It is also a waste of my time."

After reading that Facebook status, a friend of mine sent me an invitation to the "Open House Week" at Flywheel Ballantyne. I had never heard of Flywheel before, but my friend said they were offering free classes all week and suggested we try them. I wrote her back saying, "Given what they charge, I'm interested in seeing how - if at all - this is different from a general spin class." Frankly, having spent hundreds of hours in YMCA spin classes over the past 3 years, I was not expecting much.

I told her as I gripped the handrail down to the parking lot to steady my legs after our first Flywheel class together: "I was wrong."

I *know* your average spin class. Nothing fazes me anymore. I'm not the most fit looking person in the room, but this bod was built to spin and spin hard. I went into the Flywheel class with the mindset that it was cute and theatrical with dim lights and stadium style elevation for the bikes, but that it probably wouldn't be very challenging. 

As I said though, I was wrong. There are some key things that Flywheel does that make it much more challenging than your everyday, garden variety spin class.

First, there is the "tech pack" attached to every bike. Most spin classes have a manual dial, or a dimly lit display that shows your RPM's and other stats. You can walk in, saddle up on a bike, and sandbag the whole damn workout and no one's the wiser. This is NOT THE CASE at Flywheel. Your "tech pack" is a brightly lit display, easily visible to all from several feet away. It shows your RPM, Torque, current power output, and cumulative power output. Gone are the good ol' days when your spin instructor would tell you to "turn the dial 75%" to add more tension and you mimed that, while leisurely pedaling. It's been replaced by cold, hard, brightly lit numbers. Forget the other competitive aspects of the class, when I realized that the six people to my left could easily make out my "tech pack" numbers in the dark, I stopped sandbagging and started sweating.

There's a second highly competitive aspect to the ride, the "Torq Board". During "demo" mode, which is what Flywheel Ballantyne is using during their Open House week, the "Torq Board" shows the top 20 bikes. The instructor flashes the "Torq Board" during a few key sprints of the session, and you can see how your power output measures up against everyone else's power output. I'm not the fittest person in the room, but when I saw that I was "on the board" out of 35 people, I rode harder to see how I could hold up. When you sign up for Flywheel, you can opt-in to get your name on the board to see how you measure up against others.

The final, most unique aspect of Flywheel classes, is the 5-ish minutes of upper body work with 2 and 4lb bars that are available at each bike. At first I scoffed at this "workout" with such light weights, but around the 3rd to the last song, your instructor guides you to whip these out. I grabbed both (6 lbs) at the start feeling this would be easy. Soon, I dispensed of the 4lb bar in favor of just the 2lb bar. Two minutes in, I was in agony, struggling to keep proper form. Suffice to say, cycling "aficionados" such as myself haven't had a lot of upper body work opportunities  thrust upon them. It was enlightening how weak I was. The upper body workout toward the end is one of my favorite (or, perhaps least favorite) parts. 

I have been to two Flywheel classes, and I'm signed up for a third on Friday through their Open House week. I am planning on taking a fourth one on Sunday as well. The prices are somewhat expensive. Individual classes are $18\/per though you can buy packs of 20 for $280, making them $14\/per. This is still too rich for my blood, but through10\/31, they're featuring a BOGO deal on the 5 & 10 class packs, so conceivably you could get 20 classes for $150, or $7.50 per. 

It should be noted that Flywheel Sports offers a truly "all inclusive" experience at that high price, though. Each class includes use of a pair of cycling shoes, towel service, bottles of water and fruit, as well as access to lockers. I usually stuff these things into my gym bag before heading to the Y, but it's nice to have it all provided for you. Is it $18 per class nice? I don't know, but there you have it.

My final word on Flywheel classes is this: The instructors know what they're doing. They are true professionals, capable of motivating you to a spin workout harder than you'd get anywhere else locally.  If you are in a rut with your local gym's spin classes, give Flywheel a try.  I used to think all spin classes were all the same. Now, I know better.
Puke in the pool, place was DEAD as a private party was starting in a few hours and they still wanted to charge for lounge chairs even though they were closing early at 3pm. What a joke, I'll go to the regular pool and have a better time thank you very much
I would never have thought to stop here if it wasn't for the Yelp Shopping Crawl for Local Businesses but I am sure glad it was on the list to go! Velvet is a cozy store with cute clothes, accessories and very friendly staff! I personally didn't buy anything here but my shopping buddy found a few Christmas gifts for her nieces. They did have a shawl piece, which can be worn many ways, but was a little out of my price range at $48. Once I obtain a little more spending money, I will be sure to return!
THEY SELL WRECKED VEHICLES! 
I purchased a 2010 Nissan Altima with 41,000 miles on it in 2013 from Planet Nissan. They charged me $18,000 and provided me with no warranty, except for manufacturer powertrain. Immediately after purchasing the vehicle I began having to make out of pocket repairs to the suspension, brakes and exhaust system every 6 to 9 months with absolutely no clue as to why after all the repairs the car still drove somewhat unsteady at high speeds. 
    Two years after I bought the car I was finally sick of the constant problems and decided to trade it in with another dealership, during the trade in process I found out that Planet Nissan had sold the vehicle to me knowing that it was involved in a "major" car accident which caused frame damage six months prior to them selling it to me.
Unfortunately there's not much I can do now, but I would advise any savvy consumer to avoid this dealership by all means possible and go someplace that is a bit more reputable!
Unique locally owned gift shop- perfect for browsing on a girls day out shopping.  By far my favorite boutique in town.

I've been to this shop at least a dozen times- of course it's not cheap but what do you expect?  Doing business isn't cheap, especially with the prime real estate on central & camelback.

My recent visit on Monday afternoon was pleasant with a nice welcoming greeting and assistance from the shop girl.  I picked up some floral temporary tattoos ($6 for 2), a card, a Christmas ornament, knit knee socks, and a free people dress.
Came here last night and had a real good time. I've been to a few D&Bs but this one is really huge. This is the first time I've been to one with a bowling alley in it. It also had a section for pool tables to add to the arcade area.

Bowling (expensive imo $35 for an hour of bowling) was fun but they didn't have a rack with spare balls for you to choose from. So that means whatever lane you're in, you're stuck with the balls that's given to you unless you can find another lane who's kind enough to trade balls with you. This was an issue because my gf wanted a lighter ball but luckily the group next to us left so we were able to switch the balls out while the lane was vacant. 

The arcade games were cool. Just $20 gave us enough game credits to play everything we were interested in.

All in all had a good time but probably won't come here if bowling is the main thing we're looking to do. As for bar food, drinks and gaming, it's great.
Had never been here but for my first experience I would defenitly be back ... Nick who attended me was very knowledgeable and helpful highly recommended for a good ice cream.
Silent Sunday is my favorite day of any month!  What a great idea!  We ran the 5.5 miles from the parking lot up to Dobbins Point on the paved road, and love the comradery of everyone out being active and enjoying the day.  The 5.5 miles down was definitely the best part though - but watch out for the bikes and skate boarders!

The only disappointment is all the broken glass beer bottles on the side of the road....I wish people would take care of their parks.
The admirals club has been newly renovated and it looks alot better now than when it was US Airways lounge. New furniture with their own charging stations and bars with outlets.

The bar is in the back with the light snacks and always hot soups. Usually two choices.
Great photographer, all of my clients who have used Sheena LOVE her!!! She's professional and has a wonderfully calming effect on the babies and families who she shoots. Book an appointment today for your family photo session!!
Suprised to see low reviews on this spot because my visit was quite nice!  

We were seated in a huge booth that made us giggle and had great service from a young gal.

I went old school with an orange float- delicious with 2 huge scoops of ice cream.  My moms cherry Coke was just fine.

Onion rings were nice & hot!!  My patty melt was decent but not memorable... I did eat it all though!

Love the juke box & vintage decor.
Customer service is dead these days, and Century Link is a prime example of this.  We used to have DirectTV but switched over to Century Link Prism TV when our DTV contract was up.  What a hassle, I thought DTV customer service was bad......Century Link is 10x worse.  Bills are wrong every time and speaking with customer service is a total nightmare.  Expect to spend over an hour getting anything changed.

We called to add a second receiver, they missed two appointments and I sat at home all day each time waiting for them.  Each time I called to explain the situation they were clueless, even when I gave them my confirmation number.  When I asked for a free month or something for my time wasted sitting at home all day they refused.

They assured me it would be done Monday....we'll see.
Oh Costco - how I dread going to thee on a Sunday afternoon.  Those big carts + samples + families shopping with their children = me wanting to run your customers and their little children's toes over!  But, alas, it's not your fault entirely....so therefore, I like you quite a bit.  Enough to shop on a Sunday afternoon.  

See, I don't eat a large variety of foods, so the things I do eat, I eat almost every day.  Like most things Kashi - Waffles (they're baaack!), Go Lean and Rolls bars are all available in bulk.  And then there's my raisins and peanuts and Skinny Cow icecream bars.  Oh!  And Jarlesburg light swiss cheese!  I like that they have healthy items.

Despite it always being packed on Sundays, the long lines aren't really that long and the employees are friendly for having to deal with all those people.  Me likey.

Oh!  And that pizza and frozen yogurt!  Yum!

P.S. - If you're one of those people that leaves your cart next to your car or shoved up on the curb.....stop it.  It makes you look lazy.
This place smelled really funky when I walked in.  Pizza is better than average.  If it didn't smell, it would get 4 stars.
I've been looking for a spot to grab a quick bite to eat in this area of town and I finally heard about this place from a friend and came here with her for breakfast. 

First impressions were nothing to write home about. Located in an industrial plaza, you would never know this little joint even existed from the main street. When you pull up there are only two parking spots immediately in front of the restaurant. I believe the others are around the corner but we came at 9:30am on a Friday and were able to snag both spots. 

Upon entering, I noticed we were the only two patrons. We weren't greeted for quite some time as the only employee (possibly one of the owners) working behind the counter seemed more focused on finishing the ticketed orders. Another patron walked in - he seemed like a regular - and asked if we had been helped yet; we both said no. He spoke to the woman and cracked a joke about getting some service. Even still, the woman didn't speak or stop what she was doing! Finally, she helped us but by that time, the other gentleman had left out as he got tired of waiting. Once she helped us, she didn't apologize for the wait and wasn't super friendly. Interestingly, as soon as she began helping us, two other workers appeared from the back. It was actually quite strange. One, I believe was her husband (maybe the co-owner). They bantered a bit back and forth and apparently she had made a bunch of the orders incorrectly. After ordering at the counter, my friend and I grabbed a table and sat down to wait for our food. After a few minutes, I asked for a cup for water and overheard them discussing how he had made my friend's breakfast bowl with sausage when she had ordered it without. I actually watched him physically pick the sausage off of it - thank goodness he was wearing gloves! All that being said, the service, eh, was not the best. 

In terms of the food, I ordered a panini bacon egg sandwich and it was just ok. It didn't come served with any sides. For $7, I'm not sure it was worth it. My friend ordered a breakfast bowl and she noticed there were a few sausage pieces remaining in it. It came in a very small paper bowl - she seemed to still enjoy it. 

I was looking forward to ordering a coffee drink but they only had one of those diner coffee pots that was just about empty and looked like it had been sitting on the burner for several hours. They had refrigerated drinks but I opted for water from the fountain machine, which turned out to be Arizona tap water (blah!).

If I was in a jam, starving, and in the area, I would consider giving this place another shot. But my first experience here definitely wasn't great.
Great service, with great people.  Nice clean cars and very easy to do business with.  I asked them for a white BMW and with in a week I have it.  Great job luxury motor sports.
It's nothing special, the ramen is very mediocre but the compost cookie from the milk bar is good! I would only go back for the milk bar, that's it.
Ok, so here's the deal - it's Little Caesars Pizza where you can get a large pizza for $5. Not some specialty Italian gourmet restaurant where the chef did a 6 month internship in a world renowned pizzeria to learn the ways of generational pizza making.

With that said, it's decent, borderline good pizza. I prefer the deep dish and their cheese breadsticks. They also have a nice variety of sodas (they had Dr. Pepper which is a rarity).

The employees are decent. Except once I pulled up 5 minutes before closing. A guy literally leaped over the counter to lock the door and turn off the "Open" light sign. 

Um. Rude.

But it's essentially fast food so I don't expect much from them. As long as my food is edible and no one insults\/assaults me, I'm good.
Quite possibly the most beautiful street in all of Edinburgh, this elegant, curving, twin-layered goddess of a thoroughfare is perfectly placed to catch the light at the best time of the day. Its shops are a jamboree of colour and variety - book shop, pig shop, tweed shop, map shop, juice shop, dress shop, red, blue, pink, green. Up until recently it even featured a Christmas shop, and landed itself a starring role in the film adaptation of Filth.

I absolutely love this street, but I must confess to never having bought anything other than comestibles from it. I walk past Walker Slater every time with an aching heart and a longing eye, but I might as well be wishing for a platinum pony.

All the same, I often take a slightly longer route down Victoria Street and back up Candlemaker Row instead of straight over George IV Bridge, just for the pleasure of walking down this beautiful street.
great chicago style thin crust pizza with a sweet sauce cut into squares. simple as that!
Played here back in August of 2010. Pretty nice course for the middle of summer. It was in excellent condition. Greens, fairways, rough, everything was immaculate. I'm a 4 handicap, and the tips provide a nice challenge, especially when you're hitting long irons into a majority of the par 4s, as well as hitting a 3-wood into a par 3. The signature 16th with it's island green is stunning. The hardest part about this course are the greens. Trees don't really prove a challenge since most are palms, and relatively easy to negotiate, but the greens are extremely difficult. Most have several tiers that place a premium on location.
The only negatives are that they don't have a long range, only 100 yards or so, so it makes it difficult to judge your distances when warming up. And the planes overhead don't help either. Planes are arriving in the early afternoon, so it's not terrible, but when they change the active runway later in the afternoon, it sends the planes departing right over the course; and departing planes make much more noise than arriving planes.
But, all in all, a great course. Although you're definitely paying for the location.
Terrible service. I ordered through Just Eat and waited over 2 hours for my meal. Which is fine I guess, it happens. The real issue is they forgot my yellow tail tuna roll and when I complained they told me they will refund my roll but will reject every future order I place because " I'm unhappy with them ". 

Really? This is the treatment I get after waiting 2 hours for my delivery?
Pinkberry is the jam! I love that this is NOT a self-serve place. I don't need a FREAKIN' bucket of fro-yo. I want fresh toppings that haven't been tainted by small children's germ ridden fingers. I love the consistency and flavor of Pinkberry. Their tart flavors are actually tart! They have non-tart offerings as well. Their offerings change with the season, which I love. There is always something new to try! Sign up on their website to get a free small yogurt with toppings on your birthday.
Clean!
Fresh, Grade A quality sushi and ingredients here!
Friendly and accommodating staff- a pleasure!
The food, GO and have some!
Create a burrito! A bowl!
Add that wasabi aioli and I'm telling you!
Drinks get you drunk. Video games. The crowd is quite pleasant. No food, but a cool place to spend 10 minutes or 2 hours.
In full disclosure, Victoria and Antonio are friends of mine. You ask then, of course, I would give them biased stellar reviews. The truth is, as long as I've been yelping and it's been 7 years long, if it's not honest, I don't write and share it. 

Hence, this is like hearing from a trusted friend that Victoria and Antonio are great people. They are hard working for themselves, the community, and most of all for their clients. 

I've had some estate issues myself and when I turned to Victoria for a sound ear and advice, she without hesitation helped me out and not only provided some much needed comfort, everything she told me was helpful and has enabled me to move forward with my issues in a way that is assuring that it will be for the best for all involved. 

They are two of the most warm hearted people you will ever meet!
Best place for pho I have found in the valley. Get the #1 with everything: tripe, tendon, fatty flank, meatballs and the regular beef. Don't let the ingredients intimidate you. It's out of this world good!

If pho is in your future, be forewarned that the serving sizes are massive. I have never been able to polish off an entire bowl. So come extra hungry and skip the tempting spring rolls (also delicious with a killer spicy peanut sauce). Because if you've ever made the mistake of trying to stretch out a bowl of pho by taking half of it home, you know the disappointment that comes along with that cloudy bowl of watered down leftovers. Rice noodles just don't hold up well. Le sigh.

Lately I've taken to phoning in my order and picking up my Pho To Go (someone needs to snatch up that name, stat!) at the same price as the dine in option ($6-8). I have discovered the secret to pho longevity this way. Noodles and beefy parts are packaged separately and the broth is also in its own container. Nothing gets water logged and cloudy and I can easily make four meals out of one order. They toss in all the baggies of goodness too! Bean sprouts, basil, limes, jalapeno and mint in one; cilantro and spring onions in another. Hoisin and sriracha on the side. I seriously get hog wild with these additions. It's like a new bowl every time I try it!
Stopped in here today while visiting Boulder City. We enjoy visiting the different antique stores.

Many unique items to be found in here, although the couple items that I was interested in seemed over priced. I didn't have a chance to discuss these items with anyone as the one person working the store was busy trying to buy some merchandise from an older woman in the store.

I know business is business but perhaps this should have been done somewhere else. It almost sounded as if you were trying to talk a poor old woman out of her family heirlooms.
Very cool venue!  I saw a show here a few weeks ago.  My only complaint is that for "standing room only", there really isn't much room.  You have to be tall or really persistent to be able to see anything.  But, that being said, I look forward to coming back and trying the restaurant part of this place sometime...
Visited Shane's for a late lunch this past weekend. It's a small place, located in the strip mall in front of Wal-Mart. You order at the counter, they take your name and give you a glass for your drink, and then they call your name when your order is ready.

I ordered the smothered sandwich and a drink for under $10, with a side of potato salad. The food came out fast, and there was plenty of it for lunch. The potato salad was served in a styrofoam container next to the sandwich, which was packed with plenty of pork and cole slaw. I was a big fan of the cole slaw.

The food was good, but it wasn't great. It's what I'd expect from a strip-mall barbecue place. I didn't taste much smoke. It doesn't taste like authentic Carolina barbecue to me at all. Still, it's plenty of food and a tasty meal with plenty of tangy sauces to choose from. It's on par with other chain-style barbecue restaurants in the area -  not knock-my-socks-off awesome, but solid and tasty.

I recommend this place for families or couples looking for a low-key meal at a decent price. The restaurant is clean, and the service is attentive and friendly.
I went to pick up food from an order that I placed online. When we got there, this lady that appeared to maybe have been the manager pointed to the food sitting on the counter. When I went to go grab it she just put the bags on the counter and walked away so I had to call her back to get the cups which when she gave them to me she was rude about it. I gave it two stars cause the food was good though.
One of the most incredible desserts I have ever come across.  The sugar waffle is so nice and moist, I had it topped with strawberries, bananas and vanilla bean ice cream.  It was such a satisfying sweet.  Best dessert in pittsburgh hand down.
I don't give out many five-star ratings, but I love this place!  I've been vegetarian my whole life, so I've always been a fan of restaurants with this hippie-happy vibe.  I love that one of their walls is covered in (real!!) greenery, as well.  It's about as much real greenery as you'll see in one place in all of Vegas, haha.

The food itself is so good.  I wasn't feeling daring, so I had their veggie burger - YUM!!  My friend and I also enjoyed their chips and bean-dip appetizer.  Even my friend, who isn't vegetarian, enjoyed what he had.  Their alcoholic drinks are not to be discounted, either.  The one we got for free for doing a Yelp! check in was SO good!  I can't remember what it was called, but it was apple flavored.  (I also consider myself NOT a fan of alcohol in general, so this is a huge compliment coming from me.)  I definitely plan on coming back here to be more daring and try everything on the menu!
Overall, great brunch spot with LOTS of gluten free options!

A few facts about me... I love brunch... a lot... It's my favorite meal of the day. I just moved to Charlotte and I've been searching for my brunch spot. I've recently adopted a gluten free diet... which sucks because i LOVE things that have gluten... like toast... 

Enter Toast of Dilworth... There was a short wait to get a table... We grabbed some coffee from the bar for our wait. The coffee was nice and strong. It was a gorgeous day out so we stood outside and soaked up the sun. We were seated at the bar because we were ok with the first available option. We had three or four different people waiting on us, which was ok with me. I always had a full cup of coffee :) The orange juice was quite tasty. 

The spicy scramble was good. A nice blend of flavors with a bit of a kick. I enjoyed my cinnamon raisin gluten free toast. It was nicely toasted and not gross and dense (like a lot of other gluten free breads). 

Looking forward to returning!
My sister and I were having a pretty busy morning, and we were getting hungry. She is a bit of a health nut, so she suggested this restaurant! It was beautifully set up, and very bright and welcoming. 
It was noon when we decided to eat, so it was rather busy. The menu has some great options, but I ended up making my own salad (to-go). They have tons of toppings\/extras you can add to your salad!! I got romaine lettuce, jalapenos, egg whites, edamame, feta cheese, tomatoes, and grilled chicken. The lady that was helping me, pointed me toward the gentleman that was going to be chopping my salad (there were three of them total). He was very welcoming, and asked what dressing I would like. He chopped for a couple minutes then asked if it was chopped to my liking, I actually wanted it chopped more and he was happy to do so! My sister has been to Chopt plenty of times, and advised me to get the dressing on the side because I will not finish my salad. When I went to check out, they offered me complementary bread, WHAT? 
It was a beautiful afternoon, and they had tables outside so we just grabbed one. The balsamic vinaigrette was amazing! It is definitely thick, but that is actually how I prefer it! Everything was so fresh! And it was enough for two meals!! I will definitely be back.
Love this theater, along with all Harkins. AMC is pretty much out of the picture for us anymore.  If we want to see a movie (which is pretty frequently)  we check times at this place first.  We love the loyalty cup and tshirt which gets you free popcorn.
Very pretty and peaceful but much much smaller than I anticipated from the website and reviews. 

My family and I were excited to come here on a December afternoon. As recent transplants from the Midwest, we're still in awe of having nice enough weather in December to take a walk in a park. I've had this place bookmarked for a while and wanted to come and experience it for the first time with my husband and daughter. From the pictures and reviews, I thought it would be bigger and for there to be a bit more to see and experience. The cost for entry is only $5\/person, which isn't bad. They give you a map of the garden so again, we were a little shocked when we walked in and saw just how small it was -- we kind of laughed, because you really don't need a map. Still, it's a very pretty, peaceful place to come for a short, peaceful stroll -- or to sit on a bench and enjoy the waterfall, pond, and scenery. 

I probably won't return or recommend it to others but it is certainly pretty. If you're into peacefully sitting for a while and enjoying scenery than this is a nice spot for you. Just don't expect to enter a large park or take a long walk (without taking loops around the garden), like we did, or you'll be a little let down.
I spotted this place a few weeks ago (I'm new in town), and couldn't wait to return when I ran out of my soy protein because they had a rice-based protein that I'd tried and loved before.  They have a fantastic selection of protein powders\/bars and supplements.  Their prices on protein powder are lower than what I've seen on Amazon (at least for the one I was looking for), and I agree with another reviewer about the associates - they are helpful without being pushy.  VERY important in any store, but especially here, where there are so many comparable products and it's vital to have someone who can help you with your individual needs and not talk you into buying something that you don't really want\/need.  I didn't really utilize that, since I knew what I wanted, but I did notice it with other customers who were there at the same time as I was.  Definitely coming back here!  Thank you, Vegas Discount Nutrition!
Stopped in for just a drink & appetizer at the small bar.  Two open seats were open and we sat right down on a Friday night.  

I had a lemon drink (forget the name) but the bartender put a lighter to the lemon.  Really enjoyed this cocktail!

We just tried the bruschetta with asparagus and prosciutto- outstanding!  

Nice little spot to stop- in past visits the cheese charcuterie is amazing as well as great salads.
Wowza! Stumbled upon this new spot last weekend and decided to come check it out this wknd. Man, this is our new go-to for sushi in Old Town! 

Ambience - super nice, clean, and they have both indoor and outdoor patio seating. Decorative pink flower blossoms on the ceiling and a cool scenic mural on the back wall. 

Service - outstanding! We were the only customers until right before we left when another couple dined in. The three employees were all very attentive and went out of their way to ensure we had a great dining experience. 

Food - superb! I ordered a hot green tea and it was made fresh and had some sort of wonderful flavoring. It was probably the best green tea I've ever had at an Asian restaurant. The miso soup was warm and comforting. Crab rangoon appetizer was made with fresh crabmeat\/cream cheese and the dipping sauce was flavorful. For sushi, we tried a Shrimp Tempura Roll and the Godzilla Roll. Both were excellent! We had every intention to order more but both rolls were so massive we were completely stuffed! 

The sushi chef gave us a sample of his specialty pickled, spiced jalapeño salad mix and it was sooo good! When I explained I was pregnant and couldn't eat any raw fish he was really understanding and said he could cook and prepare any fish the way I'd like it. He made sure to take his time and you could tell he really put some love into our dishes

Quite impressed with this spot and I will definitely be back soon!

When you join this gym, it is like you are joining a very loving, caring, smiley, happy family, who all actually do care for you, for your goals, and always trying to help you get to where you want to get to fitness wise. It is a small quaint facility, it does not feel like a corporate establishment who only care for memberships. Personalized group training and your very own fitness program, is the only way to get fit, meet some of the nicest people, staff or members, this is the gym, I love it here.
I've been to Bookman's a few times and have mixed feelings about it. If you're going just to look around, it's fun to see all the stuff they have in there. Between the movie selection, CD's, books and trinkets, it was fun to shop around. But, as someone interested in selling to them, I would never do that again. I brought in a huge selection of books I was interested in selling and they only took 4 of the books and offered me a few measely dollars. I was shocked. I understand they need to make a profit but I wasn't even getting $1 for each book they wanted. A total rip off if you ask me and a waste of time waiting for them to look through my stuff. I'm not sure if I will be returning anytime soon.
I know diners, I'm a NYer;)  
It's not about being fancy, or necessarily upscale. Metro is about serving good, regular food. I just wish it was open 24 hours & would serve disco fries.  Ok, those are fries with BROWN gravy & melted mozzarella:)
Metro serves up piping hot generous portions and at lighting speed.  Another thing one can bank on is friendly and fast service!  They have pretty damn good coffee, plain or choice of hazelnut.  Nope, no blue plastic creamer containers for the hazelnut- the hazelnut has its own pot of coffee! Insert clapping hand emojis please.  I built my own omelet, and it was cooked perfectly with my choice of sautéed onions, asparagus, mushrooms and melted Swiss.  Excellent, neat and plated oh so nicely. 
I did keep eyeing other people's choices (dishes, yes I eyed all dishes leaving that kitchen)!  Next time, that apple French toast with almonds is
Mine!!  I will share, but only share the picture of it:). Our waitress was quite the server with one of he best dispositions of polite.  I have her warning, asked permission and snapped a picture of her and posted it here on Yelp!
Loyal Starbucks customer here- trying out this spot since it's less than a mile from my home.

Today I had a large iced coffee- which I was worried about it being bitter... But it is a nice bold iced coffee not over-roasted like Starbucks!! Plus zero calories and no sugar I can do this!

The cashier was minimal in interaction- though not rude.

My friend got something with almond milk & coconut YUM- trying that next time. Like maybe tomorrow.
In the city of Longueuil, which is across the water from Montreal in what is called the south shore area, is the quaint old town area of Longueuil. This little strip is dotted with little shops and restaurants, including this one, La Magia. 

The restaurant is in a sort of old house, with the front room cleared out for diners. The food is casual, and good for lunch, offering salads, pastas, and pizzas. I had a nice Spaghetti Pancetta, which included a nice side salad, for $11.95, very reasonable and done well. Service in the busy lunch hour was good, too.
Nothing to do with little flutes - piccolo is Italian for small, which suits this Mondrian delight on the south-eastern corner of Grassmarket perfectly. Primary coloured benches surround three sides of a table in the window, unsinkably cheerful - rather like the proprietor (who, for the sake of clarity, does not surround three sides of a table by the window). I had a delicious panini - I can't remember precisely what was in it; bacon and some other things but they had me at bacon. It was perfectly done - fluffy yet crispy and generously filled, but not overly so. There's a good range on the menu, from droolworthy-sounding focaccias to a couple of really lovely soups. My partner for lunch that day had the vegetable soup and I'm told it was... brace yourselves... soup-erb. (Thank you, thank you...)

You pick up your soft drinks from the fridge, and it's £1.50 for a can, which you might wince at if it were a vending machine but which seems reasonable in a cafe. The fact that you pick them up them yourself and they're still in a can does kind of emphasise the markup, though, despite the fact that we were later brought glasses to decant them into.

However, the touch I really liked was - oddly - paying. Apparently, they had ordered the wrong kind of card machine - one that has to plug into a telephone point instead of a wireless one - so I had to toddle on through the back door and into the kitchen to pay. Seems funny, but that little touch of character and quirk actually made it for me! I really hope they keep it that way.
Love this place!! The staff is super friendly and it's only $20 a month for yoga, spinning, Zumba, and now boot camp! You can't get better than that :-)
After my last hairstylist "broke up with me" by moving to Wisconsin (what-EVER!) I decided to go "low maintenance" for awhile, coloring my own hair and getting my bangs trimmed at a local cheap walk-in place. That is, until the cheap walk-in place (see my other reviews) butchered my bangs so badly it took months to grow the remaining bits out. That's when I realized I needed to pony up the money to go to a real salon. I chose Armis Salon based on the reviews here on Yelp and elsewhere.

Armis herself was behind the desk and greeted me warmly when I entered. She was my stylist, and I couldn't be happier with the results! First, she took plenty of time to look at my hair and talk to me to understand what I was looking for. She carefully tousled her way through my hair checking the cowlicks and texture, and asking about what side I parted my hair on, and what I might consider. She even managed to get it looking pretty good with some skillful maneuvers and said, "Something like this?"

Yes, something exactly like that, please. After we talked through colors, she was off to the races, getting me started with partial highlights, then finally cutting my hair.

The resulting cut and color was exceptional by my standards. I'm the type of person who can't wait to leave a salon so I can go home and "re-do" my style more how I like it, but Armis' work was perfect and I left absolutely happy and satisfied.

What I liked most about Armis was that she talked with me and got to know me and my hair. And better yet, when she styled my hair at the end, she instructed me step-by-step on how to achieve the same looks she was magically pulling off. She recommended I purchase some clips (and told me where to buy them) to help with styling, and recommended a hairdryer with brush attachment from Target. 

Leaving with not only a great cut, but also the information and tools I needed to keep it looking fabulous, was something I've never experienced before. Armis and her salon are fantastic, and I can't recommend her highly enough!
I love this place! It's such a cute go-to when you're craving Mexican food in the area. It has such a friendly staff and they're always so quick! The fresh chips and House-made salsa is always waiting for us as soon as we sit down! Also, their salsa is delicious! It's not as chunky and has sort of a lime hint to it - it's just so original.

I typically order the shrimp fajitas (I believe) and it comes with all the fix-ins on a sizzling dish of cheese - veggies, refried beans, lettuce, shrimp (obviously) and a handful of warm and fresh tortillas. Now, I'm not a bean person whatsoever, but I could eat an entire plate of El Camp's refried beans! They're more on the sweet side and don't have a weird texture!

This time around, I was craving a smothered burrito and boy, did I make a great choice! I ordered the Burritos Tipicos, which is 2 burritos in a warm torilla with shredded beef, refried beans (YAS), topped with lettuce and guacamole (no, it's no extra here!), swimming in a puddle of nacho cheese (not the kind you buy from the grocery store, I promise). LISTEN, it sounds like a mess, but it'll go above and beyond your expectations. And most importantly, the food is not pricey for what you get. Two burritos are about $10, while fajitas and other dishes are closer to $15-$20. But again, they make sure you get your moneys worth!
This is one of the better Starbucks I have been to.  It is large and open.  The decor is clean and more upscale than most.  The staff is friendly.

The most important positive is the fact there are almost no leaches that have set up shop for the day, to mooch off the internet.  Real patrons can actually sit down and enjoy their coffee.
Yup, it's my 4th time having sushi in 4 days.  This time I took my son who is 4 and has already developed a taste for sushi just like his mama.

We ordered the tuna, salmon, and yellowtail sashimi (6 pieces\/ $10 each) and an order of chicken teriyaki ($12)

The sashimi came first and to my surprise, there were 10-12 pieces for each kind of sashimi!  We were delighted of course and still fought over the number of delicious slices of fish each one of us ate!

Then the chicken teriyaki came and to my surprise, it was a lean cut of chicken breast with very little sauce (which was just perfect for my low\/ no carb diet!) with a big bowl of rice which was perfect for my son!

My son said, "Thanks mommy for taking me out to this supper dinner!" which sums up our meal.

Why not 5 stars, there was just one waitress for the whole restaurant and while she was very friendly, service was slow which can be hard for this mama with a hungry 4 year old in tow!
I drive by this place just about everyday on my way to work. I've always been curious about it.

While out and about yesterday we decided to stop in and give it a try.

I ordered the shrimp PO Boy sandwich. My girl ordered the BLT.

The BLT was edible. The Shrimp Po Boy was not. 
I'm not a picky eater, but I was only able to take two bites of the Po Boy. It tasted like old grease. The shrimp were tasteless.

The waiter stopped by and asked how the food was. I told him horrible. He just smiled and walked away. I think he must have misheard me  LOL

Other options may be better, but you've only got one shot to make a first impression. The impression they left won't have us coming back.
This store is always busy. Plan on spending some time there after you type your name in on the screen. I was turning my equipment in because I am done with Cox cable. Waste of money. I have one word for them,.......Directv.
I'm at a loss for words.  Ellington Funeral Service Is definitely the cream of the crop when it comes to Funerals and memorials.  My son, Tyler's service was in the care of Mr. Hunter.  He treated my son and all of us as if we were his own family.  This type of customer service in a time like this cant be taught, it has to be wholesome and come from the heart.  I cant say thank you enough Mr. Hunter.
The German pancake is great, it's a very light tasting meal, I recommend giving it a shot. You combine butter powder suger and lemon juice inside the pancake bowl.
Or
The omelets are yummy but take awhile to cook because of the size. Unlike other places that fold the egg in half. There's is the size of a plate. 
The location on flamingo and fort apache is very clean. The booths aren't broken down so here's plenty of cushion.
The quick one liner: standard shawarma for $5.99, garlic sauce is underwhelming and for comparison I'd prefer Pita & Grill down the street or Bamiyan literally across the street.

For those who want to read on:
The owners of this little spot are brave souls, with Paramount, Bamiyan Kababa and Pita & Grill all within the vicinity of this restaurant, they're going to have some tough competition. 

This small shop located at the corner of Dixie and Eglington (connected to the Canadian tire gas bar store and Mary Browns) servers up falafel, chicken and beef schwarmas and dinner plates. I think they also have chicken breast kebabs, but I can't be sure. It's a small menu and small shop, meant to be a quick grab and go. 

Some smart cookies running the place. They had a $2.99 promo running last week for a falafel, chicken or beef schwarma to get the word out (regular $5.99) and it did manage to generate some buzz as there were fairly long lines during lunch for the special. For $2.99, it's a steal...for $5.99.......... questionable. 

I tried the chicken shawarma. The chicken didn't have much flavor, there wasn't a whole lot of meat, but it was larger than the tiny sandwich offerings at Paramount.  It was your standard chicken shawarma, topped with the standard lettuce, tomato, garlic sauce and hummus (you can add parsley as well, which I would recommend), wrapped in your standard pita and grilled in your standard panini press for several seconds. It may be because the line was long and they were trying to get people through, but the shawarma wasn't put in the press for long enough to do it's work. The whole thing was just standard, middle of the road shawarma. 

As I mentioned, there are other middle eastern options in the area, and in my opinion they're all better than Anoush.  I was told the beef was better, and I'm willing to give it another try. Maybe it'll be a different experience if they're not rushed because of long lines.
On rentre à cet endroit et boom on rentre dans une nouvelle époque. De la musique de troubadours, une belle décoration, des hommes et des femmes aubergistes qui nous racontent des jokes et SA PARLE TRÈS FORT! Bref, c'est une belle ambiance jouviale. J'ai mangé des côtes levées de sanglier et de porc. Succulant! Vous devez absoluement essayer les chips à la canelle dans vos choix de patates, c'est incroyablement bon! 

Mais....... J'ai été un peu déçu quand même. Le service était incroyablement long....mais très long...Nous étions un groupe de 7 et on a dû crier AUBERGISTEEE, ON A FAIM.... AUBERGISTE ON A SOIF...à plusieurs reprises...Vous devrez débouser 6$ pour les troubadours (Ce qui est correct, car c'est eux qui font l'ambiance et le méritent amplement). Le choix de l'alcool est okey...cependant pas de Happy Hour malheureusement....

Bref à essayé une fois dans sa courte vie!
A disappointing, but well earned 1 star.

Service, service, service. This makes or breaks a business, and the new Kona Grill at Scottsdale Quarter lacked everything that defines service. Let me say that I absolutely love Kona Grill and have been a customer for years at both the High Street and Fashion Square locations. 

Our server Alec was kind, but lacked skills and expertise that is usually employed by Kona Grill. He came about 10 minutes after we were seated and took our drink orders. 15 minutes later, our drinks came and a martini which had been ordered dirty and with an olive came straight up and with no olive. After bringing this to the attention of Alec, he sent it back. Another 15 minutes later another martini came, this time dirty and with an olive, but on the rocks? Quite the way to serve a martini. 

One of our 2 rolls comes before any of our other meals come and the manager comes to apologize about the martini. I explain what happened and explain that although the martini was served on the rocks, I would drink it anyway. He brings me a final and third martini, dirty and with an olive. We had been here for about 45 minutes now with myself and another person in our party not having their meals (3 total in our group.)

The meals come another 10 minutes later. The quality of the food was good, what you would usually expect from Kona. However, that second roll we had ordered never came throughout our whole visit. 

Fast forward to about an hour and a half that we're here, and we ask for our checks. Two appetizers come on the check full price (we came during happy hour) and they charged me for two martinis! 

I bring this to the attention of our waiter Alec who then comes back with a revised receipt of $24~. I give him my card, and another 10 minutes later he comes back with a receipt to sign, but now for $31?! I immediately ask for his manager and a different manager comes to our table who then listens to our whole negative experience. He apologizes, comps our food, and we only pay for our drinks. 

The manager did the right thing, but I'm a bit concerned about the way this new Kona Grill is being managed and the employees who are hired. It's definitely not the same level of service I have been receiving at Kona Grill the last 4 years, and I most definitely will not recommend this new location for at least another 6-12 months until they get some efficient work flow established. 

Corporate and owners of Kona need to pay attention, as I could hear others around me having bad experiences. Scottsdale Quarter is too good to mess up.

I get it is a new location and there are some problems to work out, but this was bad. Kona Grill at Scottsdale Quarter needs some help, quick.
Date night at this second story wine & beer spot with freshly prepared food.

We stop in for a light dinner & drinks and are invited to sit where we like.  We get the last indoor high top table with a glimpse to the outside patio.  

The charcuterie & cheese plates were awesome!  The charcuterie featured at least 4 meats, pickles, artichokes, and a horseradish cheese.  The cheese plate had half an apple, 3 cheeses including an herb cheddar and Brie.  This was served with seeded crackers and crostini straws.  I subtracted a star because they did not explain the charcuterie or cheese types to us and it does not detail the cheese selections on the menu.

I enjoyed chatting in the lively weeknight environment and our service was just enough to be taken care of.  We never had an empty water glass and never felt rushed.
The valet at the Biltmore recomended this place.  There was a live band performing the night we ate there.  We sat outside in the patio area.  We ate late enough that the temperature was comfortable enough to eat outside.  There are some creative dinner options on the menu.  There are the traditional clasics, but there are also some twists.  The chips and salsa were good.  The red salsa was very tasty.  The green was just ok.  I was disappointed with the queso fundido because it came with spinach premixed in.  I had the beef short rib tacos.  The meat had a great sauce on it and was tender.
I had just had a small Birthday gathering for my sister there, we won this package through an email contest.  Liz who handled everything was really nice and friendly and the server we had was top notch. I don't make it over here much because I moved a bit far away but it is a great place to watch sports, play pool, drink, and eat some pretty good food.
Service here is prompt. Our sever was a funny guy and really liked talking about the balls he offers! It was a ton of fun. Actually had some decent choices for gluten free and it was excellent. Four meatballs is a bit much for me, looking forward to the leftovers. Would recommend this place for a fun, casual night.
Average to above average in every which way.

Started with caprese salad and wedding soup. Caprese salad was more of a balsamic vin tossed salad w tomatoes and mozz instead of your classic caprese. Mozz also wasn't the freshest. For an entree I had the chicken scallopini which was actually pretty tasty. Chicken was very fresh and the sauce was quite nice, alittle heavy though.
 
Overall my biggest complaint would be the price of our meal , for the price you pay on an entree it should come with a side and a larger portion. The atmosphere and decor was nice but my girlfriend and I felt the tablecloths were unnecessary in this casual "olive gardensque" restaurant and to top it off they were pre-stained with tomato sauce when we sat down.  A decent restaurant I would eat at if there was nothing else nearby of the same stature, but I would not go out of my way to make reservations in the future.
Its small gym .. I like it the only thing I don't like is this guy working at the front he was like mean .. But ill put 4 star coz the rest of the staff nicer.
I'm addicted. The line is always long and for good reason. There's only 20 seats but it's open 24\/7. We ordered the combo pan roast their most popular, shrimp and lobster far diablo, cold seafood combo all was delicious. I ordered shrimp and lobster etouffee to go for my child and it was good but not as good as their pan roast. 

Next time I'll try their cioppiono or bouillabaisse. Oh why not, I'll try both. Lol

I have been to every oyster bar in the city and all over the U.S., I have to say this is the best I've had. Fresh plump gold seal oysters and clams. Highly recommend this place, worth the wait.
This review is for my room only. The rest of our three day stay was enjoyable.

I've stayed in many hotel rooms, but this is the first time I've stayed in one with no coffee pot. Not only no coffee but no small fridge and no ironing board.
We wanted some Pho because he was feeling under the weather. We usually go to two different spots, but decided on going to a place closer and new. We looked up the closest one and this came up with four stars! So we drove literally three minutes down the street. When we first walked in, it looked like most pho restaurant and had about four tables already sat. After we ordered we were looking around and I noticed how DIRTY it was. We sat next to a wooden block (a support beam?) and it was covered in splashed food. The condiments on the table were also caked in fingerprints. Ew. We wanted to leave but since we already ordered we stayed. After we got the food I went to check in on Yelp. The sanitation score is horrible!!! Below 90... what had we gotten ourselves into?! 

The Pho was alright, not the worst. But definitely not the best I have had. The broth is way darker than other restaurants as well, and a little thicker. 

I will definitely NOT be coming back. 

P.S. He picked this place and did not look at the sanitation score before we sat... we would not have stayed if we have known the score!
Based on the reviews, I was really excited about coming here for my 30th but I guess I chose the wrong night to come with my wife. We showed up at 7:50p for an 8p reservation in a private booth. There's only 8 of them in the whole restaurant. The hostess comes to us at 8:05 and says our table is ready and begins to bring us to the back of the restaurant, not where we had reserved. When we said this isn't where we reserved, the bitchy hostess says "We're fully committed." What kind of a response is that especially when we reserved a spot. She said if we wanted to wait longer, we can have a private table. We decided to wait, and wait, and right before my 31st birthday the manager came over and said its going to be another 20-30 min. It's now 8:50p. I explained the situation and he apologized and said he'd comp a few drinks and apps. We settled and sat at a table and 10 minutes in he came over and said he'd love to move us to a private now because the couple before us left. He continued to explain they were there for almost 5 hours. We moved and began to order food. 

Salt Block shrimp was good not great. Very fishy tasting so you can tell it wasn't as fresh as it could be. 

Black truffle gnocchi and crushed potatoes were bland and needed salt. 

12oz tenderloin was actually pretty good. I ordered medium and it was on the rare side. 

The pan roasted chicken was really good. 

Waitress was very nice but seemed robotic and not personable. 

$250 later, 2 stars.
I've been going to this place for pedicures and the occassional manicure or acrylics for over a year now, mainly because it's conveniently located for me.  They always do a good job, prices are very reasonable, and Pita Jungle and JUJU are right next door!  I actually like getting mani's and pedi's without having someone talk my ear off, so this place is perfect.  Over the past couple months they went through a renovation and have a new manager\/owner - so things have looked up.
Welcome, bold adventurer, to Falko Konditormeister, den of marvels.
Do not hesitate at the entrance; do not baulk at the door handle shaped like a giant pretzel. You might wonder at its size, but come in through the door, travelling one, and behold the real pretzels of similar proportions within. Behold the glass counter that miraculously does not fracture under the weight of unimaginably large and intricate-looking cakes. Behold the arrayed bags of exotic teas, or the rich hot chocolate swirling hypnotically in lavish perpetual motion.
Your knees may weaken, but take heed: you may have to wait a while before you can sit down, for many others have already found comfort here. Here, where there is light and cheer. Here, where the denizens are quick and eager to serve. Here, where there is... cake.
Peruse this menu, adventurer. The options may swim a little before your eyes at first. White pomegranate tea. Hazelnut tea. Chocolate tea. And here, look: these gigantic slices of cream and liqueur, of fruit and chocolate, of pastry, of sponge - yes, these colossal confections of bliss - can be yours for less than £4.
Lay down your burden, and loosen your belt. You are welcome here.
Our party of 4 all loved every part of our meal at Hula's!  The food was delicious and full of flavor with just enough spice to make it interesting.  There was a great atmosphere with fresh air flowing through the restaurant and an upbeat environment.  The service was above average.  We will return again and again.
I was in the market for a new 2017 Nissan Sentra SV and decided to go to ABC Nissan again, as I had purchased a 2009 Nissan Altima from them back in 2010. After being there for 2 hours, we were told the sale price they advertised online was not the price they could do for us. They wanted to charge us $2,000 in EXTRA ADD ONS and when we told them we weren't paying for that, they told us "every Nissan dealership adds these add-ons and couldn't be negotiated." What bullcrap! We also had a trade in and they weren't willing to give us anywhere close to what the car could get. The manager came out at that point and insulted us about how my car wasn't "worth" what we knew we could sell it for private party and how they weren't going to budge on monthly payment terms and price. Mind you I have an amazing credit score, we were putting money down and genuinely wanted to do a deal with them. They basically told us to go somewhere else. Wow.

I am happy to report that I have since purchased a 2017 Nissan Sentra SV from AutoNation Chandler and had an outstanding experience! Great staff (not pushy), great interest rate, monthly payments and terms are exactly what I wanted AND I got what my car deserved for trade in! I highly recommend going there and not wasting your time with ABC Nissan!!
Never a caffeine miss at MadHouse!
I'm addicted to the walnut sauce in the sweet potato food item!
The drinks with intelligence coffee beans all pretty phenomenal!
Great pizza!! Chicago style!! Good thin crust Good cut in squares like back home good sauce and cheese. Best pizza in the west valley!! Small hole in the wall, no AC in there I think, had to call and ask where the hell it was, I passed it 3 times but was dark out lol I drove from near PIR race track and was well worth it!! It was great and will go here few times a month I bet! A must try and not to far from sox spring training for Chicagoans to get some descent pizza!
We usually have such a good time when we go but it seems like many of the familiar faces I've seen are all gone. The wait time wasn't bad at all but the service wasn't good. We went to golf, eat, and drink and the food was great but we had to ask for everything as our server kept forgetting. Brought food with no plates. We ask for napkins thinking he'd bring silverware and brings just napkins. Then we wanted to change the channel because our bay had a broken tv and it took 30 min for someone to change it. By then, our time was up. After spending X amount of dollars in 60 min on play, food, drinks we get told we can't sit there anymore because there's a wait to get in. Two things wrong here, first off we just spent a ton and for a kid server to tell us we can't stay and sit there but we can eat inside is wrong. Second off, there was absolutely no wait. It was probably the most dead I've seen it ever. Just a poor experience last night. But hey, everyone has a bad night sometimes.
I've been here twice now, first time for tires and the second for an oil change. Service here is pretty slow and employee's always seem to be scrambling, like they are under-staffed. It took an hour and a half for an oil change and this is with me calling the day before and making an appointment. I don't really understand why they take appointments if they can't get you in and have you wait like you just walked in. The only reason I came back was because if you buy 2 new tires, you get a free oil change voucher. It was nice not to pay for an oil change and my tires are great, no problems whatsoever.
I've been in here a couple of times.

Today I stopped in and wanted to pick up a few common wheat back pennies & a ounce of silver. Their salesman Dominic was great! Even though I wasn't spending a great deal of money he took the time to help me find exactly what I was looking for.

When it comes time to pick up those key dates I'll definitely come back here because of the great service.
I've played rounds here in the past where the pace of play was so slow golfers were stacking up at holes.  Not so today. We played 18 holes in 3.5 hrs. No rushing but fast steady play.  The course was wide open ahead of us with a foursome gaining ground behind us.  We ended up having a great round. The clubhouse was clean and organized, the staff friendly and helpful - even clearing up a double booking mistake at no charge. My only complaint was that it's definitely due for reseeding as there were quite a few dirt patches on the fairway.  The rough was literally rough with sand and hard pack dirt.
Bad, bad, bad.  Poor service, flavor was off on almost all of the food, we both ended up with a horrid stomach ache the next day.  Quantity  Quality. This place is overpriced for what they offer.
Amazing!  4 stars all the way....

I want to start by saying I wanted to try this place because of a yelp review from a pretty decent yelp reviewer.

Fantastic!!!! This place is legit, one of the best hole in the wall joints in Henderson.

No reservation required, just walk in and order up. Ordering the Clam chowder and the Steak Bomb I was pumped to get some of this grub into Maa Belly. These did not disappoint, the Clam Chowder was hands down freakin amazing, I nearly licked the cup it was that good! As for the Steak Bomb, Boom! This steak sandwich was out of this world, with great steak chunks  and fresh bread I was pretty blown away!! If Your hungry and want a suggestion, get these two!

Now where my experience got even better was the customer Service. Yeah the food was amazing but the service was outstanding. I had my 1 year old son with me, they had nice clean high chairs for him and played with him a little!!! Not only that, they made him some mash potato and blended up some veggies for him, it wasn't on the menu but they didn't even hesitate to make him something as well!!!! I believe this is real customer service, the staff were so nice to us that I would recommend them to anyone and everyone.

I really hope they open in Summerlin, if they do I maybe there 6 out of 7 days a week. It's pretty close to the 215 for anyone coming from Summerlin.
They have a East Coast Eats app. If you want to get stamps or send pictures etc grab it from your cell phone App Store!!


Great Service and amazing food 

A strong 4 stars
Hash, you have a hankering for Hash!  Well, this is for you! Hash with twists, incredibly delicious and succulent.  Have a seat anywhere inside and you'll soon see why this place will become a staple.   Just be prepared for eyeing all the plates exiting their kitchen.  Smell that rosemary?!  Order a fried green tomato app and then peruse their quite extensive menu.  Wait, still not past the array of beverages.  Let me suggest the smores latte- it's a succulent dessert in itself!  Well, perhaps it will suffice for breakfast, or dessert or both;)  
The hash dishes here could very well be considered a 'creative journey' for eating:)
First I must disclose that I'm coming from a vegetarian stand point, and would have never chosen this restaurant if it was up to me.  This night, it wasn't up to me so I joined a group of 6 on a Friday night around 7pm.  It was packed and we had about a 20 minute wait.

We were sat with 2 strangers at the community table, which seemed kind of awkward.  As a vegetarian, I saw one large slab of grill? skillet? and could only think of meat juices touching my noodles.  Sure, I get it, my grilled cheese at another restaurant may be made on the same surface as a burger....but at least I don't have to see it!  

Anywho, my edamame and noodles were tasty for what they were.  The service was pretty attentive and the cook was somewhat engaging (could've been better).  

Overall, it just wasn't my cup of tea.
This is another one of those reviews where I wish I could leave half stars. Since I can't, I'm giving it a lower grade because I just don't think it's worth 4 stars. For lunch, this place definitely hits the spot and tastes good. I have 2 criticisms though. One, I do not understand paying the exact same for a sandwich because their options vary in meat selection and non-meat selections. A turkey and provolone should not cost the same as a meat stuffed with 4-5 different meats. Just sayin. And two, which is my biggest criticism, is they are ONLY OPEN UNTIL 5PM?!?!?! What kind of crap is that?!?! How much business is this place losing by closing so early? I came here for dinner once and was shooed away at the door at 4:59PM. Wow.

All in all, this place is good and would recommend. Their meat and cheeses are sliced fresh every order and I do like the fact there are 2 separate counters for ordering. Prices are also reasonable, way better than Jersey Mike's. Location here isn't awesome, it's a little hidden off Broadway and 48th street. It's next to Papa John's so when you see that, turn into the complex with Staples.  It's minutes from work so I am somewhat of a regular here. Will keep coming back because it's yummy!
we went twice to Jerusalem restaurant, the first time we get the mix plate and the second time it took Hamburger  and my husband took shawarma plate. I didn't like the first time, the shawarma was to much sweet to me. but in the second time, the hamburger was very very good! it was a big burger and they put a lot of french frise in the plate. I recommend on the hamburger and also on the hummus with mushrooms. like
So I've given myself a rule that I'm going to a place at least twice before I give it a review. This is because in the past I have been going to places, been pretty pleased, written stellar reviews and then gone back and been less than pleased...and having to awkwardly revise those great reviews. 

I have been to a few different locations of Civello before and been quite happy, but I have found it to be on the expensive side and it's also a bit out of the way for me, so that led me to begin the search for another place. I did get my wedding hair and makeup done there though and was very happy. 

But let's move onto NOW. Here's the thing: If you want quality, you MAY have to pay a bit more. Now that I've gone all over Toronto searching for a hair salon, I actually don't find Civello to be that expensive. I mean, consider that you are stuck wearing your hair every day of your life, right? If you had to wear the same pair of jeans every day for 3-4 months, would you buy the $40 pair, or the $200 pair? EXACTLY! Except it's really not crazy expensive and I don't know where I got that idea from exactly....

Okay, so I'm getting off topic.

I went to Civello the first time (since I got my hair styled three years ago for my wedding) at the beginning of the summer. Now there are LOTS of people that work at Civello, so I almost don't want to say who I went with, because I'm worried that everyone is going to start flocking to Civello and demanding this one stylist and I'll never be able to get an appointment ever again (yes, yes, #firstworldproblems). But it wouldn't be fair to him, to not say and it's maybe a little silly to think my yelp review has so much influence on the Toronto community. So yeah, they put me with Byron. 

I feel so selfless!

I had some crappy pictures of what I wanted on my phone, but he worked with them and me. In the end it was gorgeous. Seriously, I wish I had taken pictures it was so pretty.

Approx 4 months later and I'm back again, this time with a few adjustments in mind. 

Once again, I think my hair looks great. 

Besides quality hair, Civello is quick to offer coffee, tea or water. They also give lovely back massages while your hair is setting. Or Byron was getting fresh. Who's to say?

Everyone there is really lovely, but Byron may be one of the better hairdressers I have had. Conversation feels more natural and he has some sort of weird, superpower memory for people, which is both amazing and unsettling. Either way it makes conversation a pleasure. And of course he does hair well, which is why we go to hair salons at the end of the day. Life isn't REALLY like Steel Magnolias...thank God. 

I'm starting to feel weird, like I'm creating some creepy fan club, so I'll just leave it at that. Civello = good.
I often feel higher priced Mexican restaurants or overrated (why go expensive when you can go to filibertos?? ;);)) but the mission took mexican food to another level... maybe it was the ginger cilantro margarita and flights of tequila that made it all taste so good... but I was in taco guacamole heaven. We had the mahi, sweet potato, and pork shoulder tacos and the were each extremely unique and delectable. I loooooved the green\/verde salsa they served on the side and the two different reds were amazing as well. The waitress suggested the corn and grits as sides and I was somewhat annoyed by her persistence to have us order more more more, but I'm happy we listened! Grits seem to be MIA in most breakfast spots in AZ (east coast I never have a problem finding it) so I was surprised to see it on a dinner menu..and excited to know they were chipotle spiced grits... no words.. so good. 
The corn was mouth watering and I realllllly hope it wasn't just soaked in butter, but they tasted awfully creamy-yum yum yummm!
We got the expresso soaked churros for
dessert and I wasn't in love with them-they weren't overly flavorful and looked kind of sad. However, the fried bananas were to die for and came with a peanut butter mousse that made me catch my breath... :):) Back Patio was nice except we were seated next to a huge fan.... bleh. kind of an ambience killer, but the food made up for it.
I think as far as airports go, Sky Harbor is pretty great. As other Yelpers have stated, for such a large airport the security check goes relatively quickly. Terminal 4 is the biggest\/best with restaurants, shops, etc but the other terminals are fine as well. Make sure if you're getting dropped off\/parking a car that you're at the correct terminal. They're working on a tram but for now you either have a hefty walk or have to catch a shuttle to get to another terminal. Plan ahead, know where you're going and you'll be just fine. Free wi-fi for your layover pleasure and an overall well kept building makes Sky Harbor a great departure point from Phoenix...c'mon, you wouldn't want to be here when it's 115 degrees either.
My family and I decided to go here for my dad's 60th birthday. I was excited to try a new restaurant. The service was amazing! We had waiters and people with meat coming constantly so bravo on service. The salad bar was good but nothing spectacular for the price. I also didn't enjoy every meat option I had (I had 8 out of 12). I remember the lamb being disappointing. I left the restaurant extremely full but not extremely satisfied. I'm glad I tried it but honestly, this place isn't for me.
My goodness this place is good! I've been several times and have enjoyed my cupcakes each time. My sister and her husband ordered their wedding cake from here and enjoyed their overall cake design and taste. Not a ton of flavors for cupcakes but they are better known for their cakes. My favorite is the cookies and cream cupcake. Plus their sandwich board on cooper is great, check out if you like cupcakes!
Ok, so, as promised, here is an update... and it's still four stars.

I wonder if it's because I have this unnerving habit of actually going into the office in person when I have a question, but EPM have been nothing short of angelic to me. Back in December, when we had that maaaad weather in December when the rain was kinda blowing UPWARDS under the eves, I emailed them two days before Christmas to say a couple of drips were coming through the ceiling. That's all it was, a few drips, but I was sad that when I got back from Christmas they hadn't got back to me. I'm cutting them some slack because they'd probably left for the holidays when my email came through and things get lost. If I'd been really bothered I'd have phoned, but there was no damage done.

Now then, a couple of weeks ago, my washing machine broke down. I did my usual trick of walking into the office to mention it and at the same time I explained about my email that had gone astray. They were supremely apologetic. In two days, an engineer was round to fix my machine, and today I had a call checking to see that he'd been, and asking if anyone had sorted my ceiling yet too. I said yes to the former, no to the latter, and they promised to get onto it.

I never expected unprompted communication from them on any matter not relating to finance. I'm impressed! This is the key, folks. Don't email, don't phone. Walk in. That's kind of my approach to stuff anyway but that's my tip to you.
I've been here a few times over the years. I'd probably eat here more if I didn't live on the opposite side of town.

I've always enjoyed my experience here and look forward to eating there again.
This is a decent casual dining option.  The prices are ok and you can get in and out quickly.  The service is ok as well.

I ordered a 12" Miles' Ten Meat pizza.  The crust, sauce and cheese or ok.  The pizza comes covered in several different meats.  You get a good amount of toppings.

There are other options as well if you are not in the mood for pizza.

This place is realistically a three star.  I am taking away one star for one petty thing that annoys me.  They offer a 10" pizza as well.  That would have been the preferred size for me, but it is only available in gluten-free.  I am not sure why I cannot get what I want just because hypochondriacs found a new "allergy".  Evidently lactose intolerance is no longer in so they needed a new go to issue.
This is our #1 go to pizza around us, and even though they don't deliver to us, we make the drive! I usually get the ranch lover's pizza because who doesn't love cheese, bacon, and ranch ON PIZZA?! Their pizza is always fresh and hot. I'm a huge crust fan and I approve of IVP's! Their wings are pretty delicious, too. I guess what I'm trying to get at is there's really no going wrong here!
Looking to go out of the Las Vegas Buffet landscape? Tired of paying 20$ plus for breakfast? Go to the Ocean One Bar and Grille!

5.99$ will get you 2 eggs any style served at a cleaned, well set table, accompanied by either Bacon strips, Sausages or home cooked Ham!

Bravo, they even serve your toast with homemade strawberry jam, Wow.

A good bet near the strip and a sure win!
We recently saw Tom Papa at Stand Up Live and while he was hilarious, I was less than impressed with the venue. This experience was overall much better than our tickets for Pablo Francisco over the summer. We chose the earlier show this time  which started right on time and didn't have nearly as many openers. 

My husband and I both opted for the 'bottomless' fountain drink to cover our two drink minimum. Our server was nowhere to be found after our initial drink service and she reappeared 15 minutes before the end of the show with our first refill and the check. She was all over the place, never said thanks for coming in (or anything of the sort) and refused to smile. It's a comedy club! It is definitely tight quarters without much wiggle room. I am sure we'll be back because they really do have the best headliners in the Valley. However, I would expect better service as this is not a cheap night out. After tickets, the drink minimum and gratuity included in the tab (for just two people?) we easily dropped $100. Hoping for a happier server next time around.
Very quick, efficient service. I stopped in for a state inspection and I was in and out in about 10 minutes. The inspection price seemed lower than what I've seen other local shops charge.
One of my favorite places to go. 

Atmosphere, food, and the people are the best part.
I am so relieved! Dr. Burquest and staff; Jenny, Melinda, were amazing with my little guy, Marco. The doctor was thorough and was nice and took the REAL time to explain all the tests that were done. We're going back in a couple weeks for a checkup, but no crystals or blockage! I've been over watering his food! You can actually over do it!  Thank you all!
The party was so fun and amazing that I want to give it TEN stars. I MUST
MUST give Lindsey and her Yelp team kudos and applause- this party was so big
and had soooo many Yelpers that if the logistics were not planned out 
perfectly, it could have been a real nightmare for the vendors and Yelpers alike. 
Instead, Lindsey and her team made running such an enormous event look 
easy and I kept overhearing what a great time everyone was having. It was so 
well planned out spacing out the vendors that the event did not even feel
crowded!!!!! 
Fort McDowell was extremely generous to sponsor the location, the buses, the Tequila and Rum buses. There were food, alcohol, and entertainment vendors galore. 
Once again, Wild Flower Bread Company came through with an excellent fitted t-shirt
of good quality. I think they got their promo worth from me because I wear their t-shirts so often from this year and last year that people often ask if I work there. Lol. 
For a list of vendors, please read the other informative and often hilarious Yelp reviews. 
My review is all about kudos to Lindsey and her team for organizing such a
FABULOUS event for vendors and Yelpers alike. Thank you Lindsey and her Yelp team!
Let me start by saying that I have recently moved here from Portland, Oregon and the ice cream bar is set pretty high.

When I walked into PS all the ice creams were covered!  I asked if they were closing, I have never in my life seen lids on two cases of ice cream! I want to see the flavors!  I tasted two flavors, I was so taken aback by the lack of a visual...

I chose the Banana Nutella, it was good, nothing earth shattering.  I also requested a waffle cone, the lady behind the counter pointed to a small empty jar on the counter and told me they were out.  It was a cup only.  I would have liked to get a scoop of nuts on top, however, I saw no nuts on the menu and nothing on the counters!

The atmosphere in this store was horrible, uncomfortable chairs, awful decor, literally nothing visibly appealing. I couldn't wait to get out of there!

My two cents, when you have an ice cream store in the desert and it's in the 100's and you don't have a line out the door your doing something very wrong.
I called to ask for an appointment for my dog who seems to have a uti. Hey ask for my last name and once they heard I'm a new patient they said they have no availability and offered to give me numbers to other vets in the area. 

Who turns customers away?  What if I was a walk in?

Not helpful to my pets health!
With a friend and I craving sushi, and being in the area of Yasu, we decided to give it a try on a weekday night. Having never been there before, I was drawn in by the atmosphere inside. We sat by the sushi bar, which wasn't very big and therefore felt kinda awkward, like a table facing the corner used for Kindergarten time outs. 

The service was a little disoraganized and I have to admit it wasn't the best rainbow roll I've ever had.

Was hoping for another sushi joint to add to the list, but not sure this will be it.
I went here with my husband and another couple as the start to our double date night. I reserved a table on the Wednesday before and I'm glad I did, but even still we were originally seats in a less than ideal table. I spoke to the hostess and a manager came out and graciously moved us, which was very nice of them, because apparently many people call and reserve specific seats! 

I have walked by this restaurant a million times and never known it was there. It is directly on Bloor, but in a small "mall" which houses The Japanese Foundation and some other businesses. The restaurant is on the second floor and there are no readily visible signs on the street, so you would never think to just walk into this place...maybe that's the point! 

The decor of the restaurant is really lovely. They have a huge, stain glass ceiling and dark wooden furniture and Art Nouveau decor. The bathrooms are large, individually sectioned off stall, with white and black tiles everywhere and large, vintage, French ads on the walls. 

Two of our party ordered from the Winterlicious menu, one ordered from the regular menu and I ordered from their regular Prix Fixe menu, which they have available all the time and is $7 more than the Winterlicious. 

They were also offering some Winterlicious cocktails...I had three (the same one) and they were excellent. 

Our appetizers included two salads, which looked great and (according to the orderes) were. My husband ordered the onion soup from the Winterlicious menu and it was great and I ordered the mushroom soup from the prix fixe and it was excellent!

The main courses included steak from the regular menu, which were ordered with steak frites. The steak was a nice cut of meat, prepared exactly as asked and the steak frites were served with a garlic aioli (which we all tried) and was really good!

The lasagna and pork belly were ordered from the Winterlicious menu. Lasagna came in a rounded dish, where it had been baked and was on the smaller side, but satisfying within a three course meal. My husband had the pork belly from the Winterlicious menu and I tried that. The sauce on it and the tenderness of the pork were really nice. 

I had the pistachio chicken, which was a huge dish! The chicken breast was served on top of another cut of chicken, but in dark meat. Both had pistachios on top and delicious sauces drizzled along the bottom of the plate and a few apple slices as garnish. I couldn't finish two pieces of chicken and I stuck mostly with the white meat, but it was a nice option to have to two and I tried the dark and it was really excellent as well! 

The reason I chose the prix fixe menu over the Winterlicious, was because of the dessert. The Winterlicious had the pistachio chicken as a main and the onion soup was an option for the appetizer, but the desserts set the prix fixe apart. On the Winterlicious menu the option was a rhubarb crumble, or chocolate mousse. Neither of which I really cared for, although I tried it from my husband and it was good. On the prix fixe menu you have a choice of creme brule (which I have heard good things about) and a sticky toffee cake. I asked the waitress what she recommended and she said the sticky toffee, because it was such a lovely, winter dessert. I had been set on the creme brule, but you know what....brules are a dime a dozen. How many places have sticky, toffee cake? 

I was NOT disappointed. The cake was amazing! It was a small, singular bundt cake, topped with a toffee crisp and a small scoop of caramel ice cream and surrounded on the plate with warm, caramel. It was decadent and delicious. 

Finally I'll mention that our server was lovely and attentive and not a single person in our party were disappointed in any way. We all left very happy and satisfied. 

This place is a little on the pricier end (would have been less so except for the three drinks myself and my friend had and the beers that the guys had), but it's great for a nice night out, or a romantic date. 

I will definitely come back some time in the future.
Inside the $200+\/night downtown Phoenix Hyatt Hotel, this is the casual dining watering hole for the hotel where mostly out-of-town conventioneers grab a bite and stiff one. 

It has a bar and tables with TVs inside, and a reasonable sized covered patio outside area where you can enjoy the warm Valley of the Sun evenings and watch the car hops park other people's cars. 

If you are here the Friday of Halloween weekend, like I was, you can sit and sip a Zombie while you watch as the Zombie Walk of 700 people come screaming by you with "Night of the Living Dead" limping gates and fake blood splattered all over them! Did you order a Bloody Mary?

Otherwise the food is ok for what it is, but the service is slow. I did have the Buffalo Shrimp, and that was good, with 4 very large battered prawns with a spicy buffalo sauce over a bed of finely chopped slaw.

They do have at least 4 red varietals by the glass, and a couple of brands in each for you winos.
Great food, excellent cocktails!! Very unique dishes, and thoughtful drink ingredients. Staff are excellent at helpful with all choices. What a gem on Spadina!!
The food was very good.  I would definitely order the Tavern Burger again but... the service sucked!  This is why I only gave it 2 stars.  There were 3 of us and when we have to wait 5 minutes for drinks thats a little long in my book.  Everything was slow from the drinks, food, and even check getting to us.  

I may give this place a second chance just to see if it was an off day.
Since attending the first tasting way back at The Liberty months ago, I have wanted to dine at Lumiere. My daughter and I saw the add for the Tasting menu and thought  what a great way to try this new french boutique restaurant. The interior of the restaurant is modern , with clean lines. Very pleasing to the eye with a view into the kitchen. We were greeted by a very pleasant server named Stacy. She gave us the wine list and menu. There was actually Two Tasting Menu's, a three course one for 45.00 and a five course one for 65.00. We chose the Five course. The wine list is a little pricey-mostly wines over 100.00 a piece. I think they should offer more options for people to try the wonderful French roses' at a better price. We opted for a St Emilion Bordeaux . We started out with a delicious Amuse Bouche of a Mushroom Potato Bisque, just heavenly and served with an extra treat - a cheese Gougere!  On to a Foie Gras Torchon,which was delicious but a little too cold and then into the 2nd course of a Lemon Ricotta Agnolotti in a great sauce of Tomato. capers and olives and fried parsley.  It was  delightful. Then "A" Scallop with a Lobster sauce, could have used more than the one. 4th Course is the Double Cut Lamb Chops-Delicous!
Topped off the night with a Coffee Pots de Creme and a French Macaroon. It was a great tasting, the regular menu looked awesome!  The only negatives were the  way expensive wine list and I felt rushed. I don't like to be rushed with a 65.00 menu!
Thank you Dr. Wong for getting me in so quickly yesterday.  I really appreciate that  you were able to take the time to help me with my glasses and getting them adjusted.  As always you guys are the best!!!!
Je vais être honnête, j'ai juste été le jeudi ...et ça vaut le coup... Open bar pour les filles toute la nuit, pour un cover de 8$ (avec guestlist) et 12$ je crois sans... Ambiance avec des rythmes latins ou tout le monde trouve sont plaisir pour danser... Je suis vieille pour clubber je sais...mais j'adore cet endroit :) Allex-y vous verrez! Fun fou de jeunesse retrouvé!
Without question, THE BEST sushi I have EVER had!! The hubs and I stopped in for dinner a couple nights ago, and we ordered 3 rolls to share, and each one was amazing! We usually like one more than another,  or maybe don't quite care for one.. but this night, we loved all 3. We ordered the Saga Monster Roll, the Rocking Volcano and the Phoenix.. and they were so so good! Our service was good, as well. One thing I love about getting sushi is that you can typically get in and out pretty quick, and this was no exception. We were seated immediately, served promptly, and of course, loved our food!
Yum! This place hit the spot last night. I had dinner plans with a friend and we were both craving something flavorful as usual, and also wanted to go somewhere we haven't been. Scared of encountering yet another lackluster Thai restaurant we decided to try Cafe Lalibela and convinced two other friends to go with us. I haven't had Ethiopian in awhile and it was like experiencing it all over again. 

The inside was small and quaint... and packed! However, after being told we'd have a 20 minute wait, we only had about 7, which was great because the smell in the place was exquisite and was starting to make my stomach sing. 

The four of us ordered the Lalibela Exclusive with the addition of an order of the Asa Wat, which was fish. I had a glass of Ethiopian honey wine to go with it. It was incredible. I was so glad we added the fish because that was by far my favorite, followed by the spicy beef. The cabbage and potatoes was pretty delicious too, though I didn't really find one thing I didn't care for. It was very flavorful and the injera was the perfect addition. The wine was great also. 

The service was pretty slow, which became an issue with us wanting to hit up sweet republic after and we had to hunt down our check ourselves. It wasn't enough that I wouldn't go back again though. And again. And again.
I recently moved to Scottsdale and took my RAV4 in for routine service.  Although I did not get the call back to schedule my service, once I got in, it went very smoothly. The service rep, Bob, was efficient, gave me a very an accurate estimate and the work was performed in a timely manner.  However, we had to call to find out that the work was completed.  Phones seem to be their weak link.
Not bad, though I expected more for the prices they're charging.  Great warm sourdough bread that went well with the creamy New England clam chowder ($5.95).  Water was kept filled.  Waitress was knowledgable and friendly, though a little overbearing.

I ordered the tilapia ($15.95) and it was just fine.  It tasted a little muddy, but not nearly as bad as (for example) catfish I've had in the past, and it definitely was better than Olive Garden's.  I didn't try it with its sauce since I don't care for lemon (or capers).  The accompanying French fries were hot and crisp, and much better than the cold (not even lukewarm) cheddar mashed potatoes (hopefully those will be better as leftovers).

The manager was very pleasant, and I admire that he was out working on the floor.

Considering their high price point, I don't know if I'll be back.  Maybe for lunch one day?  Or if someone really wants to buy me crab or lobster?

Parking was plentiful but the spaces are striped a little close together, and it got a little congested when multiple people were trying to get in and out at the same time.
Grayson knew exactly what I had in mind for my project plus he gave me a pretty good price! They had everything done in around a week. Let's just say my yard looks awesome :)
This place is just amazing! I went here this weekend when I was in Downtown Summerlin shopping. I was feeling a bit under the weather so I wanted a drink that has ginger in it. I tried the "Toxin Flush" asked for extra ginger. Man, it was the best tasting juice I've had! It was green so at first I thought it would taste bitter somehow, but when I took my first sip, I was in love! It was refreshingly good and the taste was very mild. I can drink that thing all day, every day!  

I cannot wait to come back here and try their Acai bowls! I saw that they have different kinds here and I will have to try them all!
The large bean and cheese burrito tasted like mush. It fell apart. I used to like this place but either it's gone downhill or I've developed a taste for better, like Quesada.

Plus, they won't give you a glass of water? Inexcusable.
Quick summary: Average bar, but probably the best in the immediate area to catch the game.

As with other F&F's, the decor is nicer than your average pub (the other pub in the area is a Firkin on Leslie) with slightly higher prices to match.

It has a nice atmosphere, clean, modern and tons of 60+" LCD screens that show a number of games.

Chicken fajitas ($16) were ok, chicken was overcooked and bit dry, but there was plenty of it and tons of peppers and onions, enough to stuff 4 tortillas and then some. Typical for a pub.

Beer selection was boring - big brands like Molson, Creemore, nothing remotely interesting to try. 

Took quite a while for fajitas and wings to come out, but if you're with company and having some drinks or watching the game I suppose it's not so bad.

Overall an average bar to go to, between Firkin, Fox and St. Louis in this area though, Fox is probably your best bet to catch the game.
Came here for Saturday dim sum. Was told the wait is 30 minutes but ended up waiting for 1:30 minutes. Everyone was told the wait is 30 minutes while at least 1 hour is the minimum. At the same time they gave away tables to their friends before normal customers. If they told me the wait is an hour I would have gone somewhere else. They lie to keep you waiting around.
Average place. Would not recommend unless you are on a strict budget.
Beds are worn and rooms are dated.
Twice. Twice in one weekend. Twice was I able to taste this majestic glory - the greatest rice pudding ever known on this little planet. Through the dark and cold of a winter's evening, amid the grim determination of throngs of Christmas shoppers, there shone a warm light from the market on Castle Street... the light of hope. The light of rice.

On my first visit, I was presented with a tray laden with shot-glass-sized free samples of tiramisu-flavoured rice pudding. I declined, explaining that I'm not a fan of tiramisu (I know, I know). I was immediately offered my choice of sample and, requesting the vanilla, was thrilled to have a little sample served up specially. 

Ohh...

I don't think I can effectively convey the joy that this rice pudding brought to my heart, soul and stomach. Straight away, I was whipping my wallet out for a full portion. There was choice - tiramisu flavour, vanilla flavour, chocolate flavour, and sticky toffee flavour. There were toppings - apricots, chocolate chips, crumbled Oreos, strawberry coulis and more. There was size - a cardboard tub the size of my palm filled nearly to the brim with steaming sweet goodness, to be eaten with a plastic spoon whose headlong puddingward diving destiny I truly envied. All this for just £3.50.

On visit number one, I had the vanilla with strawberry coulis topping. Classic bliss, and the vanilla just sweet and present enough for the pudding not to be called "plain". On visit number two, I opted for toffee, holding the toppings so as to allow the flavour to work its magic all alone. I honestly can't decide which I preferred. Both are memories I shall treasure.

My second visit was meant to be to try the bubble tea, but it was the stall's last day at the market. Having fallen so hard for the pudding, I couldn't bear the thought of perhaps never sampling it again, so I ended up having portion number two instead of the bubble tea which had so excited many Yelpers. Nevertheless, I live in fervent hope that the Rice Bubble will once more take up residence in Edinburgh before very long and I will get the opportunity to do so. And to eat more pudding. Please, Santa, I have been ever so ever so good this year. Bring me back that Bubble.
My go to eat in\/take out pizza, wing, cheese steak spot. Open late and they have cheap lunch specials. 

Check out their coupons. They had one that was x4 1 topping large pizzas for $20 -- and they're good pizzas w flavored crust and all -- you can't beat that!

They recently got one of those cool, new coke machines where you can customize your flavored beverages (lime coke, or any other flavored drink you can think of). Great addition. 

Cheesesteaks are bangin. Honey buffalo wings are on point. They also have $5 chicken bacon ranch fries that are great and will fill ya right up for cheap. Even their Greek salad is pretty good for a pizza take out spot. 

Love this place!
OPA!! This was my first time attending the Yiasou Greek Festival and I was not disappointed. It was everything I expected from a great Greek fest - Authentic Greek cuisine, cultural exhibits, dancing, music, art, and shopping. KC & I went on Saturday around 7 and BOY was it packed!

The space was small and there were a lot of people and things packed in. It was difficult to navigate the tight pathways due to the crowds. Just be patient. Lots of people were loitering in the walkways making traffic move slowly.

The food was really the highlight for me. We got the baked chicken platter, which for $11, was a great deal. It came with a quarter chicken, triangle of spanikopita, greek salad, dolmade, pastisto, a piece of bread, and your choice of tea or coffee. I got white meat but they do not ask if you want dark or white meat. I bet you can request either if you have a preference. It was a TON of food. Everything was excellent. We also ordered a gyro. So good!

For dessert, we bought an assortment of pastries and a baklava sundae. The baklava sundae wss worth the price of admission alone. Enough to send you into diabetic coma. Three generous scoops of ice cream topped with a scoop of baklava bits. Amazing.

A few things I learned for next year...

Divide and conquer - There are a lot of different spots that serve food. There were different menus offered inside and outside. I wanted a platter and KC wanted a gyro so we got my platter and then found out we had to wait in a different line outside for the gyro. When you are outside, look for the signs on the tent that tell you what is served in that line. I also wanted a to try a feta pie but I found out that we would have to wait in a different line for that. You can't get anything else. The lines for food were really long but they moved quickly. Next year we will split up get our respective food choices and meet back up to enjoy them!

Cash is king - There were food lines that accepted credit\/debit but they were not well labeled. Definitely bring cash. It would suck to wait in a long line and find out they don't take cash. There were a few ATMs around but I'm sure the fees were exorbitant.

Parking sucks - We found parking a few blocks over in the neighborhood. I would recommend taking the light rail or, at the very least, carpooling with friends. They offer a parking shuttle but you'll have to wait. Oh and avoid driving on East Blvd at all costs. The traffic is awful. 

Go early - The food was crave-worthy and I wanted to reprise the meal on Sunday after a long day of watching football. I decided to try out the drive-thru dining option that the festival offered. I patiently waited in a long line of cars to turn onto Worthington. When I did, I was disappointed to see that most of the food was crossed off the list. I was able to order a gyro and a piece of spanikopita but all the pastries were sold out. Until next year... 

Fun fact: yiasou is the Greek word for hello, goodbye, and cheers.
This place is a hot mess but I love a good deal so I will be back! It's in a shopping center with a HUGE parking lot and it's right outside of the westtown mall.....I love when all my favorite stores are close to each other!!!

As long as you come armed with a shield of patience you will find some cheap, unique items here. They are very similar in their offerings as TJ Maxx (i've been to both in one day and seen many of the same items) BUT Burlington doesn't only carry name brands...they also carry some VERY cheap quality items, especially in the shoes department. 

I would def. hit up BCF and score some of your basics and (maybe) jewlery before heading to west town mall and investing in some quality pieces.
Tanners is a nice upscale bar spot with great food. The only issue that I've had is with some of the bar  tenders, they tend to move a little slow and not be very attentive to their patrons. Other than that it's a nice spot to grab a drink with your girls or with your man.
Seven Lives serves up (albeit slowly) some good west coast style tacos in the heart of Kensington.

With little counter space, this small place has a menu of 9 different tacos, priced at $5 each ($4 for the vegetarian option). I tried the blackened mahi mahi (grilled tuna) and the spicy shrimp w\/ cheese tacos on my first trip here, and I'll echo other's opinions that they do a fine job here. Double layered toasted, soft taco shells, and cooked to order with great flavours. Of the two, I preferred the spicy shrimp as it was pretty flavourful (read: spicy) and dripping with goodness (tip: grab some napkins). I'll be back to try the octopus!

Be warned that there may be long lines, and the orders come out rather slowly.

Now, if only someone will make a burrito ala SF's El Farolito, I'll be a happy camper :)
Wow. This breakfast place used to be the good egg and they changed it. First Watch was beautifully decorated and the staff was incredibly friendly. The food was amazing. My wife and I started off with their freshly made juices. I had the ginger root and my wife had the glo which tasted like an orange side with carrots. Sounds funky but was delicious. We then had their raspberry walnut fresh baked muffin, butternut squash bisque, Floridian style French toast, and the elevated egg sandwich. These were all A++. This place is a must and I can't wait to bring my family.
I like this place. It's like the happy median between a fast food joint and a traditional sit down restaurant. The menu is great because a lot of the ingredients are more on the healthy side but the overall meal still taste very good without you feeling like you're eating like a vegan. I had their Cajun Caesar Salad which was very good.
A nice find away from the strip. Great for hangovers.
Small family owned restaurant with great home cooked meals. 

A bowl of Pho is $7and you pick and choose your items.

I also tried some of their rice plates. I recommend the diced beef $10.50 and traditional plate $7.50
Great customer service and great selection. The associates are very helpful. Had an old wallet that I used forever and they were very helpful in having it repaired for me.
Andra recently did our taxes. We found her to be very nice. She was helpful and explained things in a way that was easy to understand.

We'd definitely use her again.
The Vig is fantastic! Delicious mac & cheese, get with broccoli for extra fun (: 

Love the vig!
I was VERY pleased with how my Zulu turned out! Twenty times Better than where I used to take her and so affordable! Everyone was friendly and efficient. Not to mention it was very clean! Normally when she is done at the groomers she sulks all day, but she came out happy and I'm sure she felt lighter! They even gave her a cute little scarf, I highly recommend this establishment! I can't believe how wonderful of a job they did on my sweet lab!
I happened to be on this side of town visiting my sister this evening and we decided to order from this place because they enjoy it. 

We actually ordered from here once before when we were visiting her as well.

We ordered a variety of food. All of it was good except the spare ribs. Those went right to the trash. Mostly just bone and gristle on them.

Everything else was good and they were fast.
Brunch here was very good. English\/Irish breakfast. The special that day was fantastic. I had the traditional English breakfast and it was everything I expected. Filling, delicious, perfectly cooked- the beans soaked the bottom of the toast but the top and sides were still crispy!
A good local buffet. I thought the sashimi was very fresh, especially the salmon. Chinese traditional dishes we're very good and everything is refilled extremely fast. Crab legs were very good as well and plentiful. Spring rolls were terrible and the dumplings could be better.  
***Make sure you read the sign on the table before going up to to the buffet." If you take to much food and leave enough waste your plate then there is an $8 additional charge"**
Recommended though as far as Chinese buffets go.
Fantastic new location with something for everyone! Regardless of your climbing expertise, you'll find something here. 

The staff is friendly and helpful. The other climbers could become your new best friends. I highly recommend getting a membership and having unlimited access to this awesome facility.
This location was crazy busy. I think one reason is that Sunset Station is more accessible to locals. When it was in Rio, it was not as bad as this. The food was okay, there were fewer trucks than when it was at the Linq (or at least the ones that I like most). 

I do not like the fact that the rides\/carnival part was literally right next to the trucks. It was so cramped. There were fewer places to sit so even if I wanted to try a lot of other food trucks, it was always a dilemma to try and find a spot. If you're with a group of people it's even harder. I mean, I do not mind just standing on the sides while eating my food. But with this much crowd, even standing anyway was not a fun thing. 

The foodie fest is always an event I look forward to. The location could have been better though.
Decent food, surprisingly.

EXTREMELY dirty place though.  Filthy really.  This former Hometown Buffet is a prime example of why you should NEVER carpet restaurants...rice everywhere!

Also, am I the only one amused and confused when Chinese buffets serve Mac and cheese and similar items?
Come really, really hungry.

That's the best advice I can give to anyone that wants to visit Hash House a Go Go.  You will have more food on your plate than you can comprehend in a glance.  Galaxies have been known to be smaller.  The gravitational pull of the chicken and waffles may trap you in its orbit, forcing you to consume the chicken just to have a chance to escape intact... not that you'll mind doing so.

We've been to HHaGG multiple times for both breakfast, brunch, and lunch, and have never run into a meal we didn't like.  Their reliance on potatoes as a filler sometimes borders on the crazy however.  I'm tempted to ask for my next meal without any potatoes, if it's listed as an ingredient.

The meals we've experienced are the stuffed burgers, fried green tomatoes, chicken and waffles (with strips of bacon through the waffles), the chicken pot pie, the home-made corn beef hash, and some of the specials.  The chicken soup was also very flavorful.

I can't think of anything I'd improve on when it comes to the food.  Just remember that your eyes are larger than your stomach.  No one's going to think less of you if you suggest splitting an entree here!
I was able to stay here due to a conference I had to attend for work and man was I lucky, this hotel is amazing. Very elegant and classy, beautiful marble title through the whole hotel. The casino area is clean and it's packed with tons of great bars and restaurants. The staff is friendly and very helpful. They will go out of their way to make your stay pleasant. The rooms are spacous. The pools are rediculous. There are five different pools to choose from - one of which being a wave pool and one being the only pool in Vegas that offer a sandy beach. The only thing that I did not like about this hotel is that it is one of the last hotels on the strip - which means it takes awhile to get to the other hotels on the strip. At least there is a free tram that takes you to the Luxor and the Excalibur.
Wonderful service!! Our first time in tonight and I was impressed, both Tony and Mike shook our hands and remembered our names. Why can't every pizza place be this good?? These guys totally understand the hospitality aspect and the pizza & wings were delivered quickly and very tasty!
The best middle eastern food in AZ . I loved there gyro and falafel . I will love to come over here every time I come to AZ. The owner is amazing cool guy .
My husband reserved a room for our wedding night over the phone and room and bar service were ensured to be available.  When we arrived, I was still in my gown and he was still in his tux. The front desk man did not congratulate us and said rudely that he would be unable to give us a bottle of champagne as the bar was closed and it wasn't "pre-arranged."  Once in the room, a glance of the info provided on both room and bar service indicated that it was open for another hour, but when we called no one answered.  The front desk wouldn't answer either, so we finally went downstairs to ask what the discrepancy was about. He told us that even though we had been told both on the phone and by in the information provided in the room, it was closed. He said he could do nothing to correct it. In fact, he said it had happened before. We asked to speak to a manager but he (Kenyon) was the only one on duty. We not only contacted the general manager, Timothy, that night and left a message, but we have since called a main line to complain who promised he would contact us within 72 hours. He did not. We called again and left another message and have received no return call.  Our card was apparently not charged. The level of disrespect and dishonesty in regards to our stay and issue is appalling.
Great place in a not so great hotel. They have a great choices on cuts of beef and sides. I took my kids here ordered the hot rocks, tuna tartar and oysters for appetizers. For the main we shared the monster size ultimate steak 120 oz, they cut it in pieces for easy picking and all the trimmings, literally we couldn't decide so we got all of them. Lol.

Atmosphere is lounge style, service was great, food was great and definitely got what we paid for. I would come back for sure.
I think this place might be better to actually dine in but our first experience was take out. Restaurant is very small but it appears they provide spice options for dine in that they don't for take out. Anyways, I ordered the Mr. Thai Fried Rice and my fiancé ordered the garlic beef with sticky rice. $25 for both. I get home after picking up and the sticky rice was clumped together inside a Ziploc bag- weird. The portion on the fried rice was good except there were only 2 pieces of shrimp (which you pay $2 extra for) so that was a disappointment. The garlic beef was OK. Fried rice lacked flavor so I ended up adding soy sauce we had at home to bring some flavor to the dish. Overall, the food wasn't all that great for take out. I would be hesitant to try this place again.
After having ate at this restaurant at the M Hotel and Casino yesterday and sharing the experience with my girlfriend she was anxious to give it a try.

Rather than drive all the way across town we opted to visit the one a little closer to us.

My girlfriends review is right below mine. Her name is Karen. Although it is very detailed and accurate. I'll add a few things. 

She gave it four stars so apparently she was a little more impressed than I was.

We each ordered one of their fancy drinks off of their drink menu. Both drinks were overly sweet and really just not that tasty. I do admit they both looked great and we did keep the souvenir glasses as they looked pretty cool.

I felt that the wait time for our food order was longer than needed. Strange as this is the same complaint I had about the one I visited yesterday.


I ordered the blackened chicken and she ordered the pot pie. As usual the portions are humongous. 

Both items arrived piping hot. All of this is good but again I found the food to be only satisfactory. It'll definitely fill you up and it was tasty enough. The presentation is terrific. ....... but again I just don't fell the urge to have to visit this place again.

I'd recommend other places before recommending this place.

The check was around $60.00..

Again we had a overall satisfactory experience. Good and hot food. Friendly staff. Clean environment.

Something just keeps me from giving this place more than 3 stars.
Wow, I'm surprised that there's only 1 review for Hailo. This app is the best. Love the graphic looks and how easy it is to sign up. It's very helpful during the last snowmageddon. I hate walking in a blizzard to catch a cab, so I just used this app and the taxi will come right in front of the building. It only takes 8 minutes for me to wait my cab during last weekend snowmageddon! I also love how I can pay with my card. I'm not a cash person and hate carrying cash. I mean come on, this is 2013. Paying with plastic sheets are just more convenient.

The only problem is that the taxis that are using it is still limited. So, I had to keep on tapping my phone to keep on finding cabs. I think that the app should make it an automatic thing to find another cab if I got rejected by one cab.
Very good pizza.  The crust was crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside - the way it should be.  The pepperoni was perfectly crispy on the edges and oily in the middle - the way it should be.  

Cheap, clean, friendly, and plenty of seating.
TACOS TACOS TACOS J'EN VEUX ENCORE. J'ai connu cet endroit cet été, car je cherchais des toilettes sur St-Denis...quand je suis rentrée à cet endroit...l'odeur m'a dit...que je devais revenir très prochainement....ET BON PROCHAINEMENT FÛT LE 30 NOVEMBRE 2016. wow...c'était bon! Le truc de fromage, chorizo dans un petit plat en terre cuite et EXCELLENT...c'est à essayer. J'ai bien aimé les taquitos frits aussi offert en entrée. J'ai pris des tacos al Pastor...ils sont 3 pour 6$, un bon prix :) j'ai pris de l'extra avocat...malheureusement...ce n'est pas le meilleur avocat que j'ai mangé de ma vie...il était ben ben pâle et les tranches étaient ben ben minces. Les 3 sauces servient avec tout sont bonnes...par contre j'aurai aimé avoir des tortillas ou quelque chose pour les essayer toutes.

Mon ami m'a donné un de ses tacos...je ne me souviens plus c'était lequel...c'était du porc..mais il était dûr..pas trop triper. Bref, au prix qu'on paix et à la déco qui est offerte...on y va pas pour le service....Il est minime....ahhh et PAS D'INTERAC!! (Ça vient de perdre 1 étoiles...pas d'Interac en 2016...c'est poche)
The good: Chicken & apple sausage. Yum!
The bad: VERY limited gluten free options. The waitress wasn't willing to work with me. I ended up ordering off the a la carte menu. How difficult would it be to add a plate with eggs + protein + fruit\/side.
Ugh!  I want to LOVE this place. . . but:

This weekend my wife and I went out to eat here for my birthday.  I liked the place, having gone there with my Dad a few weeks ago, and wanted her to get to try it.  The plus side is, she really liked the food.  I did too. . . sorta (explanation follows).  

They were out of a few things, but I decided pumpkin pierogies sounded awesome and different.  She got steak. . . rare. . . as usual.  We got mussels for an appetizer and the sauce was fantastic!  I always want to drink what's left as soup, but I didn't, cuz I'm klassy.  

They brought out my wife's steak (cooked just the way she likes it, bleeding as if stabbed) and chose that moment to inform me that they were out of the pumpkin pierogies.  Now I'm very easy going when I dine out.  I'm mostly just excited to have someone cook and clean up and try new things.  But if you're out of something the time to inform them is not as you bring the other person her supper.  I stared blankly at the waiter (who seemed sort of "new") and said, "And you're telling me this now?"  

I eventually settled for skillet-seared scallops with bacon on honey-siracha polenta.  They were good, if somewhat over-sweet, and we were going to cap the evening with coffee. . . but they were out of it, so we settled for their version of a molten chocolate cake.  After a few minutes they stopped over to the table to inform us they were out of that as well.  At that point it seemed appropriate to say, "we'll take our check now".  

Although the owner, and both waiters came to the table to apologize for effing up my dinner so spectacularly, when the final check came, there was no "hey, sorry about your dinner, we took one of your cocktails off the check" sort of gesture, and I admit I was thinking they would do that.  Not that I expect it, or even ask for it when it's not given (unless it's a total debacle) but it's still something that a "good" gastropub should do.  

I was mostly disappointed because I really wanted my wife to have a good experience there so I could convince her to go back, and it was my special magical birthday week dinner. . . and they botched it. . . so I tucked my birthday tail between my legs and we went home.
New to the area we took a party of twelve for a special family event. Petros and his team did a great job, and his Mom even made a special Greek dessert. A must visit in the Upper Beaches!
Food is terrible, ambiance New Orleans decor, but not quite the right feel, service terrible, didnt have silverware for our appetizers, food took 25 min,  Strip prices, not really worth all the inconviniences.
This place has great pastries. I'm a big fan of the almond croissant (esp if they warm it a bit) and the hazelnut cake is to die for. Soooo good! They also have a nice crepe selection, both sweet and savory. I've tried both and they don't skimp out on the fillings. The apple strudel crepe was particularly good and the filling wasn't too sweet and the apples were still crisp. They have a nice coffee selection too. 

I've been a few times and the service has been wonderful each time. Definitely one of my favorite bakeries in Tempe and I'll be back often!
Arizona sunshine, salsa, wide open park space, beer, margaritas and good vibes to be found at this festival.

Benefiting the hemophilia society, tickets to this even are tax deductible and either $10 in advance of $15 at the door.

The competitors must prepare their signature salsas on site each morning providing fresh spicy goodness all around!!!!!

Macayos is dishing up the drinks with margaritas and beer for all.  We wish they had a menu posted with prices and all available margarita variations.  Also the top shelf tent is cash only.  We got drinks from a little set up by the salsa booths and the girl used a square to ring us out.  She said it overheated on Saturday so maybe that's why they stopped using the card readers.

For the salsas!!!! You get to sample about 25 different booths and vote by donating money in a jar.  

My favorites are all the hot ones!! Some use Serrano, jalapeños, or habaneros to add heat.  My favorite was the "effing hot" which had a bright fresh tomato and sweet habanero with slow lingering heat that doesn't overpower.  

We were struggling to get by with no "chip tray" ($1) and I spilled salsa on my shirt... oh well I just used some water to clean and cool off and we were on our way.  I saw some people with trays they brought from home- nice!!

They had a margarita mix off but the emcee was super tacky; boasting about getting his ankle monitor off that morning.  He then proceeded to greet the audience by telling us we are in "his house" and we will "do what he says with no hesitation."  He then choose 2 young female audience members to come in front of his stage, kneel down, and open their mouths.  He poured shots in their mouths and complimented the second girl for sticking her tongue out.  Was this dude from Jose Cuervo??  We left immediately and I am not the type to be offended!  Because of this tasteless event I reduced my rating.  In the past cozadores has hosted this mix off which I found to be informative, fun, and interesting.
Came here with the hubby last Sunday and was pleasantly surprised. 

We ordered the beef salad which had all the right spices, the ratio of spicy, salty, and sour was delightful and tasted wonderful! The bits of lemongrass takes me back to my moms cooking when she makes Larb, a different dish but taste is very similar. 

I had the red curry, which was just okay. Felt like they had way too much curry paste in it and wasn't diluted enough. I probably wouldn't order this again as I would want to try other things on the menu. 

Hubby ordered the crispy garlic chicken. He really enjoyed this dish. It had just enough crunch but wasn't heavily drenched in flower like orange chicken. The sauce was a little too sweet for me but I enjoyed it as well. 

Overall, I would come back and try other dishes. The menu and flavors seem authentic thus far. We also saw an older Asian lady working in the back, hopefully cooking the food so you know it's legit. LOL
This town has a variety of all kinds of dining styles. The Charcoal Room is more than substantial and durable. The menu has just the right amount of choices and it's not one of those imposing 'book' menus.  The first dish to arrive was the scallops as an appetizer. The depths of these bay scallops were perfectly cooked. Next up- the entree which was in a pool of delicious drippings. As a friend and myself dined at the bar we had the pleasure of Carrie being our server.  Carrie is not your amateurish bartender, she's poised and makes that connection in knowing you and your preferences. I informed her  to surprise us with a dessert- perfection! That chocolate cake is scrumptious, BUT what had me was the rock candy.  Yes, rock candy along with my espresso. I will return for that!  Well, The Charcoal Room's food and service as well;)
The operations GM gave everyone who entered the craziest attitude because the place was packed for World Cup. I didn't appreciate it at all. I asked for a seat and she said they're not seating anymore. I then asked so if someone leaves what happens. She said then if you're on the list you get the next seat. I was confused. I asked her to add me at the next available table.
I've been coming here for over 2 years.  I can honestly say it's the best gym I've ever been a member of.  This is the place where everyone knows your name, it's what initially kept me coming even though I was to sore to move.  All the instructors are very knowledgeable and seem to care about each person completing the workout with proper form.
Wow.  I remember expecting to really enjoy this concert, but it touched me very deeply.  I've always loved Celine's music, but when I went, her husband's death was still fresh enough that she honored him in her concert.  To feel her love for him, and to feel the crowd's love for her (and I was among them), and her love for her fans - a sincere and kind love - was almost overwhelming to me at points.  There is no lip-syncing here.  She is real, and completely amazing, in every note of every song.  I look forward to seeing this show again sometime.
How has it taken me this long to discover the awesomeness of CM's deli. I always knew Common as the place to go for beer and look at the weird gag gifts - horse head mask anyone? Thanks, Bethany D. for helping me discover how great the Later Hater is. The breakfast sandwiches are awesome and the lunch ones aren't too shabby either. I have a love hate relationship with the slices of Carolina Pie Company pie they have in their coolers. I love to eat them but my waist hates it. If you frequent the CM for coffee, make sure to take them up on their buy 4 cups and get the 5th free deal. The funky vibe and tasty eats can't be beat.
OMG - just had their special:  baked cod on mashed potatoes with brussel sprouts and "mom's special bacon vinaigrette".  It was to die for - seriously one of the best fish meals ever.
Great flavors and fab margaritas, finally!

The hunny and I stopped in in a Saturday night around 8:30 pm.  There was plenty of open parking.  Tqla is located one light south of the 60.

The entrance is very nice, facing Val vista with 2 oversize doors.  We sit in a booth, only 1 large group nearing the end of thier meal with 3 small children.  We ask to sit one booth over which they obliged. 

We started with a passion tea for him and a Chambord Rita for me and guacamole.  The Rita was great, swirled Chambord into the frozen house which did have a nice bite.  The guacamole was a large portion but the avocado was not quite ripe.  The house salsas are very good, one yummy Limey green and a hot smoky deep red thin sauce.

For our entrees we got the steak quesadilla and the carnitas tacos.  As for the carnitas, it was tender but most likely slow cooked.  To me it was more of a red chili pork not a true carnitas that's shredded and crisped.  The steak quesadilla was awesome with yummy cheese and all sorts of flavors.  

We were full and did not try dessert. Nice and accommodating service at this New Mexican spot.
You Guys are Amazing you Make Shaved Ice how it is supposed to be! Round of applause for you guys! By far this is my favorite location!
Highly recommend. They are a professional experienced dog trainers, who teach with positive productive techniques, that get results. 
WE are thrilled with our two five month old German Shepherds! We took the three week overnight training! Could not be happier, are dogs are happy that we did the training also. Ha Ha! We can live in harmony now. They learned to swim and also had the rattlesnake protection training also. They had a blast.
The fish and chips were delicious and flavourful, but I can't give 5 stars to fish and chip places that give you little packets of tartar sauce. Come on guys! Step up your game. Make your own version. Sell it for an extra buck. It would set you apart.
Food was good but  took forever. It seemed like they needed more help. 20 minutes for not being that busy.  Hopefully next visit is better.
Dr. Shelly is the best! She knows what she's doing and what she is talking about. She is able to work on anyone. I use her, and I refer all,of my clients to her. Local Vegas\/Henderson residents get their first adjustment free! What could be better than that? Go in and have Dr. Shelly adjust you. Now. You're still reading...call her, or better yet just drop in. Just do it. I promise, you will not regret it!
I was tempted to give this place two stars, but I'll explain why.  First and foremost, the view from their balcony is absolutely the best thing about this place.  It offers one of the best views of the Strip you can possibly get.  My date and I got free tickets to go up and enjoy the place.  It has a really cool vibe to it, as well.

But, unfortunately, my date was Completely ignored by the bartender when he went to get a drink.  He stood there 20 minutes(!!), with a $100 bill in his hand, all the while trying to get the guy's attention and watching others get served.  Finally my date told him he was the worst bartender he'd ever met.  Best part: the guy didn't even react.  Wow, Foundation Room.  Way to not impress.  Bottom line: go for the view.  If you're lucky you might not be ignored by the bartender.
Always a great place to get authentic, home made Mexican food in a casual environment. The house Sangria is also home made and delicioso!
This location is the worst, food quality fails big at this location . I used to order frequently . But it seem the food is horrible dried out most of the time . I stopped ordering from here I have complained to Cara on 2 occasions , but it seems that they don't really care about the customers, that this particular location delivers to . I'm assuming cause its a franchise. This restaurant gives Swiss Chalet a bad name. The manager promised correct the problem, but he's full of it. It seems like they give people dried out day old chicken and get away with it, when you complain the give you half the cost of the meal and actually expect you to order from them again. Beware
I have worked in the area for years and tried a number of lunch items. Everything always tastes very homemade and high quality! 

Soups are always delicious - Carrot ginger is a favourite, and they always come with a piece of bread for dipping.
Cobb salad is excellent, they are pre prepared but come with a creamy and tangy blue cheese dressing on the side.
Quiche with greens - my favourite lunch which I get fairly often from Le Gourmand. They always have 2 or 3 types (ham and cheddar, goat cheese and roasted veg, smoked salmon and dill are all common options). With greens it comes to 6.99 which is well worth it, the pastry is flaky and buttery and the portion size is very fair.

They also always have hot lunch specials (lasagna, curries, meatloaf etc.) and a range of sandwiches that can be put in a panini press.

Finally you can't go without grabbing a cookie, particularly the chocolate chip w\/walnut are the best cookies in the city without a doubt. I think they're around $2ea but I would pay 3 no problem. They are crispy outside and gooey inside just like you would attempt to make at home but fail! 

Give it a go if you're in the area, they also have a nice little patio area on Spadina.
Went for dinner last night, food was awesome, especially the onion tart we got for starters.  Drinks were good too, but I got a cranberry lemonade with vodka and it was kind of weak.   For my entree I had the Mediterranean salad and split a mushroom pizza, both of which were very good.

The only negative was the length of time to get our food.  We had a 7 year old boy with us and he was very hungry
Great chicken fingers and Bread. However charging for lemonade is nonsense and they need to get some ranch and BBQ sauce. Otherwise some of the best chicken fingers around.
Where you can find me most sundays. But lately the service is getting SUPPPEERRR SLOOOWWW. Plus the price has gotten insane, last weekend it cost $42.00 for my bf & myself, crazy for breakfast. The french toast is extremely good and their bagels are fresh.
This is a great little find in a stretch of Eastern that has a ton of restaurants. You can tell they put a lot of thought and caring into their meals. The fries are fresh cut, the bread on the sandwiches is great and the value is exceptional. It will be well worth your time to stop in this little gem. I had the Philly Cheesesteak (with no peppers). It was exceptional.
I have been to Judit's twice now. The first visit was for a pedicure, the second for a manicure and pedicure. Both time, I found the spa to be relaxing, clean, and professional. I went with my mom and mother in law two days before my wedding and Judit and all of her staff were so warm and welcoming. They gave us fruit and mimosas, helped us pick our colors, all while giving top notch service. I have never received a compliment on a pedicure before coming to this spa. I have received multiple since my first visit!!! I will absolutely be back again!
My go to place for  takeout Mexican.  Chorizo tacos are on point, as well as the chimichangas and enchiladas.  Can't beat the prices either.
Charlotte's premiere indoor sports and entertainment arena. I've been for sports games and concerts. TWC Arena is clean and centrally located. Easy to access via car, bus, light rail. Drink prices are my biggest complaint - but I guess a premium is expected.
There's a lot to like about Bali Hai golf course, and as others have mentioned, the price is high so it's a splurge round for someone like me.  This place is beautifully maintained, especially when you consider it's in the middle of a desert.  They were also pretty smart about the design. Since people are paying big bucks to play here, they emphasize enjoying your round & playing from the tees that are most appropriate to your ability.  No one wants to fork over a ton of $ and then get super frustrated, so they very wisely put a lot of variety on the distance from black vs. gold vs. silver tees.

Everyone here is super polite, practically grabbing the golf bag out of your hands when you show up, putting it in the golf cart for you, and giving some friendly advice.  I thought the variety on the golf course is pretty nice - some holes have lots of terrain & uphill carries, and several holes have water that you definitely want to avoid.  It's a tad noisy from the airplanes from nearby McCarran airport, but honestly, it's not even a distraction.  Just a reminder that you're in prime real estate on the Las Vegas strip!  The bunkers were REALLY hard the day that I played.  They felt like concrete - no fluffy sand at all.  Maybe that's because it's late fall, or maybe they're always that way.

There are lots of ways to avoid paying full fare on this golf course by booking early morning or late afternoon tee times.  If you are the least bit curious about playing this golf course, I recommend  trying it.
I am such a fan of Lucy.  I'm a bigger fan of Lucy at Kierland Commons in Scottsdale, which is a bummer because this one is closer to my new home in Chandler.  

The store itself has a weird layout, in part because of the two entrances I think?  And the saleswoman I encountered (not the preggo one) was a little too eager for my taste.  She was really, really enthusiastic.  I did finally let her help me, and she was helpful.....but still.  

Anyway, Lucy has great active wear for the avid runner (like myself) and your every day yoga gal.  Plus, if you give them your address you will get discounts from time to time!
Chinese and mexican together?! Yes please! This place is really great and I can't believe tonight was my first time trying it!! Location is a little hidden but once you pass Dobson, it's clearly visible (turn right after Circle K). Restaurant is really large and staff was really friendly. Since it was my first time in, they let me sample a few of their menu items. I thought that was really cool! I ended up ordering the jade chicken (similar to sweet and sour), gringo chicken in a quesadilla with chicken fried rice and refried beans. We ordered to go and waited about 10-15 minutes for our food. When we got home, I was excited to try all the food! Quesadilla was amazing...jade chicken great, beans good and rice was OK. I LOVE that they give you a warm snicker doodle too! Cookie was really good and the perfect way to end the meal. Overall, this place is great and will return soon!
This is Terrible I wanted to try this location (power Rd.) and they made the shaved ice terrible they didn't even put the flavoring though out the entire thing Poor customer service they treated me like i was just another customer. (I Strongly recommend the one on Mesa Drive they make shaved ice's how they are supposed to be.)
Holy effin' eff! Best happy hour anywhere in the valley! 

Challenge: If you can find a better happy hour than the three dollar bonanza at Cafe Zuzu, I will eat one of the wretched pickled eggs from Palo Verde Lounge, the gray-green eggs that time forgot.

I'll start with the tapas-style appetizers because they really blew me away. Two fall-of-the-bone tender braised pork shanks that will melt in your mouth and fill your belly? Three bucks. A surprisingly ample mini prime rib dip with (unassuming) horseradish mayo and au jus? Three bucks. Two buttery, rich grilled brie and thin sliced green apple sandwiches with fig jam reduction? Three bucks. I'm salivating right now. 

The other two options included the border chili, which had fresh chunks of meat but was a bit bland compared to the rest of the apps, and the bruschetta that was utterly forgettable. Standard tomatoes, olives and capers, nowhere near as memorable as Il Postino or La Bocca's stellar examples. 

Since these apps are a bit on the small side, the best bang for your buck to sate your hunger would be the mini pork shanks, followed closely by the prime rib dip. The artisan grilled cheese was my personal favorite (sooo perfectly buttery, sweet and savory!), but it really would have benefited from another little grilled brie sammich on the plate because they're quite small. 

Several of our party tried the wine (chard, pinot, merlot, and I think they've even got some bubbly) and had positive things to say. While we all had zero interest in trying the beer, since it was just PBR on draft or domestic swill in bottles. There were much better options to be had for three bucks, like the specialty cocktails! 

The waitress that took care of us was kind enough to explain what each of the cocktails entailed. Best liquor bang for your buck? The Hot 'N' Dirty, an extra dirty vodka martini with a splash of Tabasco and three olives. They even bring it out in a little cocktail shaker to pour tableside, ensuring that not a drop of goodness is wasted on the way to your table. Second most potent potable was the Bourbon Smash, a whiskey cocktail that's the illegitimate love child of a mojito and a mint julep. In the words of Sammy J, "It'll getcha drunk!" 

The Gin Fizz was one of the most refreshing cocktails, kind of a gin and tonic with more prominent citrus notes and a splash of simple syrup. And for the girlie girls in attendance, the Bramble, Basil Showbiz and Cherry Limeade will treat ya right! The Bramble was heavy on the blackberry, the Basil Showbiz strawberried out and the Cherry Limeade had me second guessing whether someone had spiked a Sonic limeade. Superb, one and all. I haven't a single bad word to say about any the cocktails taste-wise, although the more frou frou drinks seemed a bit light on the pour. 

Three dollar beer, wine, specialty cocktails and appetizers? A frenzy of (relatively sophisticated) gluttony? A mere 15 bucks. Cafe Zuzu is my new go-to for happy hour!
This is a nice addition to the food choices at Aria.  We were sat quickly and our server was friendly and helpful.

We started off with some meat and cheese.  We chose the chorizo rioja and the rogue river blue.  Both the cheese and meat had great flavor.

For my pizza I chose The Gotham.  It comes with pepperoni, sausage, salami, mozzarella, and grana padana.  It is a good pizza.  It has a relatively thin crust and the sauce has good flavor.  The toppings and cheese provide a good assortment of flavors.  Two people could likely split a pizza especially if you get a salad or appetizers.
If you're an Indian food fan and are looking to try something new then you should definitely check out Thanjai! South Indian food is a completely unique flavour profile then what you might try at your standard Indian resto in Montreal like Maison Du Cari or Le Taj which serve up North Indian fare. 

The menu is vast and most of it top notch. If you're a first timer my advice is stick to the south indian classics. 

Starter:  Idlis or Rasam vada. (the first a steamed rice batter dumplings, the latter are fried)
Main: Dosa! Be adventurous and prepare to get your hands a little dirty as you eat - it well taste best if you attack with your hands. Every dosa comes with sambhar - a lentil soup and chuntneys which are high quality and absolutely delicious.
End: must try the south Indian filter coffee. It's unique to the south - sweet and strong.  

Thanjai does a great job serving up south indian cuisine - with great service and a great ambience. It's a must try and you will want to return!
The guy working was such a nice guy. My boyfriend and I got chicken teriyaki bowls. Delicious. Especially for the price. We will definitely be back.
Steve, the Chief Marketing Officer at Trufusion followed up with me really quickly to resolve the misunderstandings. It turned out that the second girl looked up the wrong account, therefore did not see a note, and charged my credit card for the wrong account. I brought up this issue with Braeden at the front desk, and he was super patient and helpful. Unfortunately only managers are authorized to issue refunds, so the money was refunded a few days later. So the next time you go to pay for something, make sure they are looking up the correct name!
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for salvaging a horrible meal at Armstrongs. 

What a hidden gem this place is, tucked away in a strip mall at Thorn Run Rd\/Beaver Grade Rd. They close at 9PM, but stay open for a few extra minutes to let the late stragglers (like me) through. GREAT business strategy.

The girls working there were easy on the eyes, but more importantly, VERY helpful. Thank you for the conversation and welcoming me to the area! 

Kip's has great names for all the ice cream flavors (like PENNDOT ROAD for rocky road hahahah) -- mostly dog themed. Some flavors rotate in season. However, so as not to leave the customer guessing, there is a cheat sheet to show what is in each flavor. 

Everything here (except the no sugar offerings) is made daily on site. Prices were excellent and it's a very inviting store. I had a double scoop of a dark chocolate and fudge ice cream for under $4 that was out of this world. Very creamy and clearly of a fresh flavor. Nice benches outside too once it warms up. 

Do you like ice cream?
If yes, is it before 9 PM?
If yes, do you have cash?
If yes, DO NOT GO to Dairy Queen, Cold Stone, Baskin Robbins, etc... 
GO TO KIP'S. 

5 stars and I will be back repeatedly (weight loss pending).
We stopped by here for lunch this afternoon. The place was packed.

I thought we'd have a long wait, but we were shown to a booth in just a few minutes.

The hostess and our waitress were both very friendly. I appreciated them taking the extra effort to stay friendly when it was crazy busy like that. I deal with the public on a daily basis and know when it's super busy like that it can sometimes be a challenge to keep a smile on your face and a kind word on your lips.

All of our meals were excellent. If I'm ever in the neighborhood I'd definitely eat here again.
BEWARE: SERVING SIZES ARE GINORMOUS!

We did not know this^^ and over-ordered!! Next time the BF and I are splitting a plate of pasta! 
Calamari appetizer was SO inexpensive and SO much food! In fact I think all their dishes are underpriced for the quantity that you get. This was the most delicious app I have had--so flavorful and so FRESH! 
On top of the calamari we also got the sausage pasta and the seafood pasta. Both had heaping amounts of food and delicious in their own sense. We were seafood-ed out after the appetizer so we were devouring the sausage pasta. The sauce for the sausage pasta was amazing--we took the noodles from the seafood dish and dunked it in the other plate's sauce to drink it all up :)
J'ai savouré une fois un cornet de crème glacée  au beurre d'arrichide et de chocolat C'était bon ,mais la dimension  moyenne  était trop grosse  pour moi je n'ai pas pu le terminer. Aujourd'hui  j'ai commencé un sorbet au citron et framboises.  Rafraîchissant  !
I started coming here the day they opened their doors for the first time and I'm so glad! The place is super clean and organized, they have a light (but nice) vintage touch on their decoration and everybody is just very friendly! It's the only nail place I've been to that I actually met the owner and see her regularly greeting costumers and making conversation with them. It just makes it for a more inviting place. 
They have a good size selection of regular nail polish and a great selection of gel and sparkles. And just like many nail shops they offer other services like waxing, facial and lashes extension. Their prices are similar to other nail shops I've been to so I consider them fair.
My nail technician is Andy, I've known him for a little over two years now and I promise you, his massages are amazing! He does a great manicure and pedicure too, of course! 
Check this place out and have fun with the gorgeous pin-up pictures and vintage mirros on the walls.
While it may be bigger and have lots of things hanging from the ceiling, I do not like this REI as much as the one in Tempe. It's way more pretentious and getting good service is about as common as seeing someone in Scottsdale without Uggs and Daisy Dukes on.

However, sometimes I'm in the area and sometimes they have things the other store doesn't. I strictly go here to pick things up and leave as quickly as possible.
Dave is honest and trustworthy. He has been a lifesaver during the hot weather in Phoenix when our ac went out. Thank you Dave
Honestly the best pizza in the south hills that isn't Mineo's.  Fresh, hot, pizza.  Generous toppings.  Friendly staff.  Seating inside for folks that want to take their kids.  The only problem is that the wait time wasn't very accurate which was odd since I had gone on a Sunday night.
I. Love. Sprouts. This store is truly fantastic. Unfortunately, there is not one close to our house so I do not frequent them as much as I would like to. However, this location is near my work and I will sometimes pop over there on my lunch to do my grocery shopping.

I think stores like these have a reputation for being much more expensive than a typical grocery store. My experience has proved otherwise. Granted, we do not eat meat so I am not sure what the comparative prices for those products would be. However, the food we do buy--vegetables, fruit, dairy products, etc--is very affordable. They may be a bit more than what you would spend at Fry's but the quality is certainly a cut above.
Surprisingly good. I was just walking out of the South Point sports book and saw this place. Excellent steak. The Decor is a little out dated, but very good food. I had no idea this place was even there. Glad I walked by. Someone was telling me they have been around for quite some time. I guess they moved from the strip to this location a while ago.
I had a tummy tuck and the whole staff was amazing. I am so pleased with the results!
This gem is tucked away in an alley at Green Valley's District area, but don't let that fool you - going here, you almost feel like you're no longer in Las Vegas, Nevada, but rather in a different part of the world.  It has a romantic, intimate feel.  The food is delicious, and the drinks are fantastic.  I came here yesterday to meet someone, and a friend of mine - Dominique - was bartending.  Others have commented on her ability to make incredible drinks, and I will add on to those positive comments!  Whether you ask for something on the menu, or something not on the menu, it will be one of the best drinks you get in all of Vegas.  I've lived here a little while, and I can testify!  They are thinking of adding live music soon, out on the little patio out front; with the right artists, this can only add to the experience.  Definitely recommended!
Avoid this car wash.  Tempted by the coupons from Safeway's receipts, I decided to try them out.  Over several visits I have found the employees to be highly unprofessional.  There is also a. very high chance of your car being damaged.  Don't chance it!
Went here for a some authentic street thai food. Service is okay for a busy night. Waiting in line is frustrating. I waited 15 minutes until a waiter noticed me. I came alone so they just gave me a random bar seat. Some people behind me were obviously there for 10 minutes before a waiter noticed noticed them and had them wait another 15 minutes because they were in groups (and plus 15 more minutes before their food come). So total wait for groups is at least around 35 minutes(possibly more) before they could chow down. 
I ordered the beef khao soi, squash fritter and thai ice tea. Love the squash fritter. It was not greasy at all. Sweet and crunchy is a nice way to work up my freezing palate. Their thai ice tea is the best. Really fresh compared to other places. I'm not sure what they added, but it was definitely more than sweet condensed milk and sugar. They might use rock sugar or palm sugar. I'm not sure, but the sweetness feels familiar to soupy desserts that my mom used to make. I don't really dig the khao soi. For me, the spices are too light that it tasted bland for me. I think they're trying to fit it into north american tounge. I will definitely come back to try their pad thai and curries because I love their thai ice tea.
Crispy is my jam. Get the Grilled pork and a Thai tea with boba. You'll be a full and happy camper for less than $9.
My husband likes his shirts fitted. I'm serious - we have his T-shirts altered for perfect fit. And after they closed the FCUK in San Francisco, I was at a loss, yeah I know there are other places - but my husband has the body of the statue of David and the men's selection here pleases him. 
The guys helping us was super-friendly - wish I got his name, but his service and the product is quality - will have us stopping in again.
Arcadia Farm is a Phoenix standby, I moved here over 10 years ago, it was thriving then and it's still thriving. It's a ladies who lunch kind of place full of nutritious, delicious light lunch fares and a wait staff with extremely low turn over. It is not surprising to find a wait staff who has worked there for over ten years. 
I used to go there often with clients when I had my architectural office but it's been years since I was there last. 
When Lindsey organized a CMYE $3 donation (for a delicious baby cake) to St. Mary's Food Bank, I happily signed up. 
There were 15 of us there and we were seated in a private back room with fresh flowers on the table, very nice. 
The waitress was very friendly and bragged about the owner which is always a good sign when the staff is happy. My friend and I ordered the crab cake and grilled shrimp salad to share and although it took awhile for the food to arrive, it was delicious. 
They also surprised us with complimentary hummus, pasta with grilled shrimp, and a desert tray. So really, we didn't have to order any food and we would have been plenty full!
The generosity of the owner who I hope one day to have the pleasure to meet as she seems like the kind of wonderful lady I would enjoy sharing a conversation with, is apparent. And this stands to reason why after so many years when many restaurants have opened and closed, Arcadia Farm is still as successful and popular as ever. 
I and Yelp thank you for a generous and enjoyable afternoon of lunching!
If you are craving KBBQ in Las Vegas, this places is open 24\/7!

It is large and each table has the BBQ built in the table with a full hood over it. Most of the tables are actually booths large enough to fit 6 people. The service is friendly and attentive. I was checked on several times.

I went with Bulgogi ($21.95) , which came on a heated platter after I was served a large plate of salad leaf greens with a vinegar chili dressing, and 6 side dishes including potato salad, seaweed salad, spicy daikon, kimchee, and Age tofu slices,  The bulgogi was well marinated and served with grilled green and yellow onions, with sesame seeds and a little oil. Bowl of white rice and an OB beer completed the picture.

Dae Jang Keum is the name of a woman of 400 years ago who served the royal queen in Korea as a famous and inventive cook. It is also the name of the lead character in a Korean Soap Drama about the same woman. The restaurant decided to name itself after her.
Love this store selection, employees helpful but not trying to SELL you.

Ever since I found this store years ago I've been a loyal customer.  I love the self service aspect to try on as many shoes as you want without feeling guilty.

Great prices & rewards!!
Unfortunately I was looking forward to trying this place. But when we got in, we sat for 2 minutes and we  could not breath . Just not ventilated enough for both of us and it was way too smoky . very small place. If I do make it around again maybe ill try take out. Rating just based on our experience of the restaurant itself not the food
Love this hotel!!! Stayed in the "Forest Gump" room. It had memorabilia from the movie and a great view of the Eiffel Tower. I love gambling here  as well at the Pleasure Pit.  Overall this is an awesome hotel\/casino.  I recommend checking this place out!  The only thing I don't like is that they recently started charging a resort fee. But, I still love this place...
Pho Bang is a chain of franchise restuaurants started out of New York City. There are 3 in NYC, 3 in Houston, and one each in Taipei, New Orleans and this one in Phoenix. 

It is old and grungy, and hard to get to with the light rail construction. The prices are dirt cheap, the decor is dirt cheap and the food is un-remarkable. They offer most of the usual Vietnamese dishes, from Goi Cuon appetizers (summer rolls) to Bun (vermicelli), Mi (egg noodles), Com (rice plates) to stir fry chicken, pork, beef; also seafood, some specials and Pho soups (16 different ones).

The Pho comes in 2 sizes, with most regulars costing only $3.95, and the large costing $4.50. Their large is equivalent to many places' medium, however. The broth is average at best, and all the accroutements are too. 

I am not sure how the franchise works (royalties, menus, common logo, etc) but if you want a very cheap meal and you are not a snob or afficianado of Vietnamese food, this places works for a quick filler. They will show Korean Drama DVDs dubbed in Vietnamese on the TV if you ask. They will watch Korean Dramas themselves when it is slow anyway, even if you don't ask! Winter Sonata anyone?

PS - Pho Bang in San Jose is not affiliated with this chain.
This place sold me two pairs of glasses. That's fine. But I needed to return one of the two of them because I needed a more specified type of glasses than the optometrist here prescribed for me. I returned one pair. I needed to change the prescription on the other pair. The customer service here is poor. The individuals I dealt with on the phone did not know how to treat customers--to provide an example: I was told to call back in a half hour when someone who would know how to answer my question would be there. In other words, the right foot has no clue about what the left foot is doing. Nor does it care. The doctor's portion of the office seems to have nothing to do with the glasses' fitting portion of the office. They have nothing to do with them--and want nothing to do with them, and vice-versa. 

There is an obvious lack of communication acumen here. I will never go here again for glasses.
Ocean Trail never disappoints. They have a variety of Cajun style food. You can order gumbo or pan roasts with either white or dirty rice. One dinner meal is enough for two people, the portions are that generous. You can specify the level of spiciness, on a scale of 1-10. I order the shrimp pan roast with a spiciness of 4. That's about medium spice level. 

The restaurant is right on the casino floor so it's pretty noisy. There is limited seating, with about 6 tables and about 15 seats around the bar. It gets busy on weekend nights, with long lines forming. Get there early, about 6ish to get seated quickly.
My husband and came here for a quick break from the hustle and bustle of vegas. Very enjoyable.  Our drinks were very good. The lobster tacos were delicious.
I haven't been here in awhile ever since we have been going to Jasmine Tokyo but my friend and I were in the neighborhood so we stopped in for lunch.
Happy to write that cozy, friendly feel is still there and the hour and a half we were there for lunch there was a lot of foot traffic of people coming and going for lunch. 
They still have their Chinese menu, 40-50% off different rolls and all you can eat sushi for $24.95. 
Still a great neighborhood spot and great for a quick lunch. 
Of course . . . the only sushi place my son will ask for by name is Jasmine Tokyo . . . but I still like this place!
I came here with my parents after we went to look at a house in a nearby neighborhood off of Durango. It's about 15-20 mins off the strip, so I would only come if I were in the area.

Upon arriving to the complex, it looks dark and like everything is closed. Once you open the doors to the restaurant, there's so much light and space!

When we came in, the two waitresses were busy with other customers, so they told us to sit wherever. We also had to get our own menus since we were in a hurry. I'm used to the type of service where they pamper you and can get annoying by asking you too many questions. This was the complete opposite, but the waitresses were super sweet so I can't complain! Plus since I told them that we were sharing, they brought out an extra plate. Some places you have to remind or specifically ask for a plate.

The portions are HUGE and extremely filling! We got the Teriyaki Beef (I'm not sure exactly the name) and the Chicken Katsu Moco Loco. It came out relatively quickly. Each plate came with the respective meats, two scoops of rice, and a scoop of macaroni salad. 

My mom and I shared the Chicken Katsu plate, which had chicken that was deliciously crunchy and well-made and came with some sort of BBQ sauce on the side. The macaroni salad was also good; it is light and a good complement to the flavorful food. My dad's Teriyaki beef was good and reminded me of Korean BBQ. It was slightly salty and too flavorful for my liking, but if you mixed it in with the rice, it was much better. 

We saw some other people get the Korean short ribs, which looked awesome so if we're in the area, we're definitely getting it!

The prices were relatively cheap! It was around $9-12 for a plate with meat, rice, and macaroni salad. I'm not sure what the poke was, but it was listed three times on the menu, each time ranging around $17-20, which deterred me from ordering it.

Summary: Good (tasty food and pretty good service) Bad (far from strip and not too visually appealing building)
Having just moved into an unfurnished flat, naturally my first stop for fitting it out with the necessary furniture on a tight budget was the Mystical Realm Of Flatpack. You know what you're getting with IKEA, and (assuming what you want is in stock) you get the same at every branch. So what's so good about this particular branch?

Well, for starters, it's on two levels. Other branches of IKEA that I've been to have all been on one floor, which is fine and dandy until you reach the "Marketplace" (that's the bit where you can actually put stuff in your trolley instead of just writing down the name and number of things too big to carry) and suddenly you get totally lost. You walk through an interdimensional gap in the chopping boards and find yourself way back in Sleeping Solutions with no way to reunite with your companion ever again, like a Rose Tyler of futons.

Not so in this natty two-storey arrangement. That two-phase approach to the IKEA experience is neatly divided by a set of stairs.

The staff are also rather pleasant. The lady who scanned my multitude of pallets wished me "happy building" and the chappy who served me my hot dog (you gotta have a hot dog; it's the law) was almost skipping around the counter. Strange but true.

Everything that I wanted, with the exception of a mirror that I really shouldn't have been thinking of buying anyway, was in stock. Lucky me, or efficient them, or both. (Clearly if breaking a mirror is bad luck, intending to buy one that you don't even need is very good luck.) And I sailed away with a song in my heart and a desk in my van, and a merry afternoon was thereafter had sorting out screws and cams and what-the-heck-is-this-things and generally converting two dimensions into three.
Arrived on opening day!  Got in the monstrous line at 8:26.  Ordered at 9:01.  Food was served at 9:13.

The cashier was thoroughly trained on the register.  Not all the registers were open but I'm not sure if the kitchen could keep if they went any faster.  

There are two sets of smallish flat screens mounted on the upper wall of the dining room.  The patio was very large (they took Modern Steak's entire patio space looking out into the parking lot) and had a lot of larger capacity communal type seating (lots of benches, long tables, ring of seats around the fire pit).  The brand new wood-decorated interior was a perfect temperature when they had the front open to the patio.

The salted crinkle cut fries ($2.99) had a great texture, and are best when they are fresh and hot.  They become less crunchy and fluffy as they cool.

The chicken sandwich ($6.29) has a noticeable yet mild kick and a really great crunch.  The bun was toasted well.  The chicken was somewhat oily, but very juicy, and you can tell it is non-processed white meat.  Compared to Chick-fil-A, this chicken's crust was much crunchier, and the bun also had a better texture thanks to the toasting (CFA's sandwiches tend to be very "soft" though their seasoning is always spot-on.)

The black and white shake ($5.29) was incredible and actually tasted like the cookie's frosting.  I couldn't really place the chocolate flavor, but it was unique.  It was not too thick, but not watery either...just perfect.

Nitpicks: The ketchup dispensers were empty, but they had large plastic Heinz bottles out for customers to use.
 
It's quite loud inside due to the louder volume music and all the hard surfaces, and because it was very busy due to the opening day rush.

Their water comes from a self-serve dispenser on the condiment table, so there doesn't seem to be a way to get ice water.

They front the valet lot, but for parking I just used a parking garage and walked through the mall.

Overall: The employees are what push this to a 5.  I was surprised at how helpful and hospitable the employees cleaning up the dining room were, even offering to take my trash and throw it away for me.  Many employees made friendly small talk with customers, and a gentleman who I believe was the manager was on the floor.  This is also a great location for younger people, as it's more relaxed and quite a bit cheaper than Zinburger, while offering a more upscale (nicer decor, serving alcohol) atmosphere than Five Guys, The Habit, and Smashburger.
Usually this course is beautiful. I came today and spent decent money to play. The greens and fairways were horrible. I'd rather putt my ball on a bag of dicks then putt there again. Seriously it was that bad. I've played at courses where I spent the same amount of money and the course was just beautiful and lush. Last time I'm going there in the summer.
Purchased a Groupon for a Brazilian this week and decided to check this place out. The online service made it easy to make an appointment and there were plenty of available time slots which was nice. 

The aesthetician was very friendly and worked quickly but also missed 3 large patches. I appreciate a quick wax but quality is definitely more important.

Probably wouldn't return, disappointing to pay for a service that was only partially completed.
Yummy donuts. They are made a la minute, so if you are ever in need of a warm, light and fresh donut you will never be let down. Only complaint I have is the cleanliness of the place; I live in the Mile-End so I like the antique and mismatched vibe however I don't like the idea of my food being handled by the same person who gives me back my change. 

Besides that it's a cute place and I will definitely be back when I need to satisfy my sweet tooth!
Yes, I'm guilty.....

I love Juicy Couture terry and velour.  
I love the plain ones....no logos, no crystals.  
I love the J pull on the zipper and the snap pocket pants.  
I love when I can find those for 30% off....which is right now. 

I love that I have a dark purple zip up and pants to wear on my wedding day, while getting ready.  I don't care what anyone else says - they're super comfy and make me feel better about myself when wearing sweats around.   So there!  

Oh yes, and the women here are very friendly and helpful!
Great beer and music!

Came here with the wife and her mum while waiting for our dinner to be ready. Filled up quick. Would come back again!
I have checked prices at Most stores in las vegas and found they not only have the best selection but the very lowest prices one beats them on price and service they are awesome they have laminate engineered hardwood tile carpet and the lowest prices baseboard crown molding and trim About half the price if other stores
Sugar Bowl is a fun, whimsical ice cream shop in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. It's cheap, yummy and makes you feel like a kid again. I have never had regular food there but if it is a sweet treat you're looking for, this is your place!
The nail tech I had was great and it's actually best gel I've had. I would've given another star if it wasn't for their false check in ad of 10%. 

To redeem the 10% off for check in the require you to do a review before they honor the 10%. Who's going to do a proper review while standing at the counter?
I have been a client of Kristen for 5+ years and can't say nothing but great things.  I see Kristen every month for my brows and Brazilian.  Before Kristen, I have gone to so many places for my brows\/ Brazilian and have nothing but horrible stories.  If you're thinking about getting a Brazilian you must call Kristen!    Not only is she a great esthetician but an amazing makeup artist.   When I got married I booked Kristen to do my hair and makeup.  She did an amazing job!  She's really talented and an absolute doll.
You can never go wrong here with any item that you choose.  These guys have been in business for over 30 years in Vegas, and once you eat here you will know why.
I don't know why I always forget about Lola. I visit on occasion to grab a Friday morning kick in the ass to go, but always regret never sitting down to hang at Lola. It looks so comfy and relaxing. Like a spa. The colors, the textures all make me want to stay. 

It's not my favorite white mocha, but it's a good one. I wouldn't come back if it wasn't.
This location is usually really busy but the employees are friendly and helpful. We love all things Apple so this store is fun to check out when new releases come out. If you need to go to the Genius Bar, definitely make an appointment online before heading in to the store.
This is another great activity that the Red Rock Hotel and Casino offers. It is a huge bowling alley that is located near the Regal Cinema. The place is clean and the equipment is well maintained. I am not sure how many lanes there are, but like I said, the place is huge. They even have another section for private events and VIP bowling. You would think it would be over priced because it is located in a casino, but it's not bad at all. I have to admit though, I am not aware of what it costs to bowl anywhere else. I'm not a bowler. I just take the kids here to Red Rock.

I only bowl once in a while with my kids and I'm not an authority on bowling alleys, but I would recommend you check this place out. The staff is very helpful too. Fun times!
We visited Eggspectations twice on during our trip to Montreal.  We would have gone every morning if we could have, it was that good. It was recommended in the Montreal guide I had purchased. Great tasting food, great presentation, very friendly staff.
Mark & Mike rock! They give great service for a great price & will be our go-to guys whenever we're in Vegas. Certified RV technicians and entrepreneurs; a great combination.
Ok here it is .... I really don't know what more I can say I'm running out of all great things to say.. I truly love and consider all the baristas my friends, they truly make my day, I look forward everyday to see their beautiful faces. Even if i send one of my kids to get me coffee they make sure to write a personal note on my cup.  They go out of their way to teach the new baristas my drink , you want your drink done right by the most friendly people you are ever going to meet and an atmosphere that is super friendly and cool i suggest coming here.
It's not a fluke - another great visit at Dolce.  I came for a trim and color with Rylie again, and she really does a great job.  She styled it super cute (if I do say so myself!), and that's always a big plus.  

Oh yes, and they now do Magic Tan - yippee!
Fro-Yo Wanugee here. 

This Golden Spoon is brand new, only opened 10 days ago. It's hidden in the Promenade shopping mall on North Scottsdale near Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd, my old stomping grounds.

It is SPYFY. (Server Pours Your Fro-Yo). Normally, I like PYOFY (Pour Your Own Fro-Yo) because it gives me better control of what I want. SPYFY has set prices and portion controls, while PYOFY has self-serve amounts and is charged by the ounce. 

However, I have noticed that most PYOFY places use inferior Fro-Yo machines. The consistency of the Fro-Yo is, well, inconsistent. I have also noticed that most SPYFY places have better consistency in their consistency. I think it is for two reasons:

1. SPYFY doesn't have every pimple faced kid jerking off the machine to PYOFY. 
2. SPYFY places, more often than not, user a higher quality Fro-Yo machine. 

Like this SPYFY, Golden Spoon. They use higher end Taylor machines (their the ones with blue LEDs on the front), which have better temperature control, and less hands jerking off the white pud.

So there is less dribble before it comes.....out. 

I guess the analogy between PYOFY and SPYFY is like Sex with a partner (PSFSS - Partner Stimulation For Sexual Satisfaction) ) and Masturbation (SSFSS - Self Stimulation For Sexual Satisfaction).

You may get a much more satisfying outcome from the PSFSS  versus the SSFSS. 

Just don't confuse PSFSS with SPYFY and SSFSS with PYOFY. 

You may not get the consistency out of either sticky white streams that you wanted.

Fro-Yo Wanugee here. You know you love me long time!
I've been to Taco Haus twice now.  The first time was actually before they opened while they were having a brief 2 hour open house.  They had a few tacos to choose from, chips & salsa, agua fresca, and toward the end they also brought out some ceviche.  Between my husband and I we tried all the tacos (they were offering chicken, carne asada, and lamb).  We were really impressed. Hubby's favorite was the chicken and my favorite was the carne asada.  The lamb was good, but a bit spicy for me (although it doesn't look like it made the menu anyway).  The ceviche was really tasty too.  I found the chips and salsa to be just okay (chips were really thick, and the salsa needed more flavor) and the agua fresca was watered down (they just had it in a large container with ice already in it).  Overall though, we were happy and it was definitely a place we wanted to go back to once they opened.

We just went back this week for Taco Tuesday.  We had empanadas to start, several tacos, and some street corn.  We had absolutely no complaints about our food. The chorizo empanadas were great, the tacos were super fresh and delicious, and the street corn was new and interesting (the popcorn made it different, in a good way).  By far our favorite taco was the pork belly.  It was so good we had to get a second round of just those (note: those are not part of the taco tuesday special, but well worth paying full price).  Unfortunately I was on some medication and couldn't have a margarita, but I'm definitely looking forward to one next time.

The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because based on some pictures I've seen online (both from the restaurant and from other diners) it seems like their dishes aren't always consistent.  I was expecting my street corn to be on the cob, but instead got a bowl of corn kernels with toppings.  Do they substitute with canned corn when they run out of fresh corn? My pork belly tacos, while delicious, were pretty plain (just a single stripe of avocado crema on top), but I just saw a picture of the same taco with some beautiful toppings.  These are pretty small things, and they won't stop me from returning.  I just feel like they should provide the same experience for all diners.
Came here for dinner while visiting a friend- great place to grab some barbecue take-out. We chose to avoid a sit-down because it was crowded and loud. The Carolina pulled pork is great- light vinegary sauce packed on the side so you could put it on later. Hush puppies were good too. The Mac and cheese was thick and creamy and the noodles were cooked just right- not mushy like some places. Husband had the tacos and loved them! Our friends are regulars here and we know why!
Very goood ribs. I preferred the rub without the sauce. Deep fried corn is awesome.
First time here was about a week ago for the soft opening, the staff was all smiles, food was amazing, drinks kept coming. 2 pool tables, nice lounge area inside. The patio area has a cool setup. Excellent service!! Been coming back ever since.
People - if you come to Toronto, do your mouth a favor and come here. 


Seriously one of the best meals I have had in a good long while. This was our last dinner in Toronto before heading back to the states the next day and it was WELL worth this hike from the distillery district. 

Food: I couldn't even recommend anything in particular, EVERYTHING was DELICIOUS. I think all in all I ordered 12 skewers? Maybe more, I don't know - I was in a blissful haze. Order a pitcher of Sapporo and kick back with good friends and enjoy the atmosphere. We waited 30-40min for a seat and it was definitely worth it.

Ambiance: part of the charm of this place - you definitely get the feeling of being in an izakaya here. The vibe is just...rambunctious for lack of better word. Wait staff are friendly. 

Do it. Seriously.
I have taken my straight razor in here a few times and the Phoenix Knife House brings is back to brand new every time. The customer service here is outstanding, staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Plus the service is pretty quick.

This is the only place I will go to get anything sharpened. Next up are the kitchen knives.
The Rental Center at LAS is about 7 minutes away, after you line up at peak times for a bus with hundreds of others. The line moves pretty quick though. But once you arrive at the center, it is huge, with the main counters in a cavernous room, and the cars behind on 3 or 4 levels. 

Avis is on the right side of the building. Check for your name on the big board if you are Preferred like I am, then take the left hand escalator down (it is counter intuitive, you expect it on the right side) or if you have one of the free luggage carts, take the elevator. Avis is practically an entire garage floor of cars. There is a Preferred building down here, too, with another board to check your name and parking slot. I am always way out there, like G27 or K9, what a dog! 

Get your car, check at the gate, and your one your way. Despite being large, this operation is pretty smooth and efficient, most times. I have had snafus here though, like when they had NO CARS and my reservation was useless. Nobody else had cars, like Dollar, Hertz, Budget, so I was sent to Alamo\/National, and had to pay a lot more, and then file a voucher to get a credit. Good thing it was for biz and not out of my own pocket! I would have been out several hundred dollars for the weeks it took to get my claim money.
Came here for a late lunch with a few of my co-workers; it was probably 2:15 when we arrived. It was not busy, and we were greeted immediately after entering the restaurant. Although it was a couple minutes until we were sat - the server who sat us had a smile on her face. 
We were waiting for a third person to join us, but she was literally two minutes behind us. The server doubled check how many guests we had (3), and came back with silverware - and by then the third guest joined us. 
He greeted us politely, and asked if we were ready to order our drinks. Of course we had to get milkshakes - they were half priced! After a couple of minutes he came back and asked if we were ready to order our meals - and we did. 
It did not seem that long before our food came out! It was all hot, and quick. The food did come out before the milkshakes, but they did come out right after the food.
The chocolate milkshake was delicious! But it was so thick, I could not use the straw. I do like thicker shakes, but not that think - just my personal preference, nothing against SNS. 
I also ordered the 3.99 double burger (which came with fries). The fries are thin and crispy, but yummy! The burger came with lettuce, tomato, mayo, pickles, ketchup and onions (no onions for me though). They are suppose to be thin burgers, but they were flavorful. 

Overall, the food was yummy and the server (and everyone else we encountered) were very polite and welcoming!

P.S. Our server was Keith!
I stumbled into this place over the holiday weekend and fell in love. This is a nice casual spot with a "Cheers" type of feel to it. The bartenders are friendly and the patrons are regulars. They don't have food but sell snacks they also have live music on certain days. The decor of the bar will really grab your attention it has a very tropical feel to it. When you go there be sure to "roll the dice" for 0.50 cent you get to roll two times if you get 4 of the same dice you win a 6 pack! If you get 5 of the same you when the cash in the jar from people who paid to roll the dice but have previously lost! I rolled and didn't win but who knows maybe one day...
My family has been going to T&M for over 5 years. They are honest, friendly and caring. I wont take my cars anywhere else! They are the best in nevada! I highly reccomend them to anyone and everyone!
If you frequent overpriced suburban wish fulfillment adventure outlets like REI, I would recommend you avoid the Taco Nazo and hit up the Schlotzskys instead. That way you can pay in excess of ten dollars for a mediocre meal to be consumed in a lively atmosphere, the perfect compliment to REI. 

Leave Taco Nazo to us trash people that enjoy kick ass pork, pickled carrots, gigando delicious tortillas and as much flavorful (but not scorching) squeezy bottle hot sauce as our gullets can handle. 

This place is in the weekly lunch rotation for me and my lunch crew, who generally show up coated in a thick layer of dust, dirt under the fingernails and salt crusted sweat stains pretty much all over. Nobody ever bats an eye. And if you're lucky you can get some cheap produce from folks hawking their wares out of their pickup beds out front.

Arrive hungry, horf down a burrito, and leave satisfied. What more do you need?
This is an amazing laser salon! I've heard some horror stories of people getting burned after treatments, but this is my second time going and it has been smooth sailing! I did my face\/neck combo and it took about a week to really see the results because it takes the hair follicle that long to come off. I just did my second treatment and looking forward to finishing the rest so I can do something else =) . Ani (the owner) was really friendly, but she is doing more marketing for her business and make it expand. Everyone there was really friendly and the prices were just right.  They don't force you into buying packages like some places - so you pretty much pay as you go. I prefer it that way because you have options (which I like). Their prices are really reasonable and there is a breakdown on their website. I paid $105 for my neck and face. It takes about 6 sessions to really become hair free. This is my go-to laser salon and I highly encourage everyone to go!  There is some pain with any procedure like this, but all tolerable! Take a Tylenol an hour before you go and you can survive it!

Thanks again Ivy Laser Salon! I am looking forward to your next location ( hopefully in North Las Vegas).
Today the service was terrible. The cashier didn't listen to our order. When you spend $30+ dollars on sandwiches, you expect better. Will not return.
We frequent BJ's on girl's nights. They have good food, a casual atmosphere and great beer. I would give it a higher rating if their prices were a little lower for the type of cuisine you get. Can't go wrong with the crispy artichoke hearts, the pizzas or a baked potato.
Great selection of al vintage albums in great quality. Owners are very friendly and hospitable. Love the oldies I found that remind me of my teenage yrs!!
I absolutely love Cave Creek and when I get the chance to drive up there, I love to explore it's unique places. I love all the places to shop and eat and the Horny Toad is no exception there. The name captured my attention and we pulled into the dirt lot and parked. 2 adorable stores are also on property next to the restaurant. Prepare to step back into the Wild West days with the wood panels, floors and funky décor. A friend and I came for lunch and the patio was crowded so we sat inside. Service here was very good and quick! You can smell BBQ throughout the entire restaurant so the pulled pork sandwich was calling my name! We got our food within 10 minutes. Here's where things went south...the BBQ was very average. Coleslaw was OK. I didn't finish my plate. I do hear the fried chicken is what's popular but of course didn't know that until after I had already eaten. Bummer.

If you're looking for a unique experience in a great little town, go here. If you're looking for amazing food, go somewhere else.
Like chipotle- but Mediterranean food!!

The hubby and I came in on a Tuesday night. I got the chicken plate which basically includes everything on the bar from salad to Taboulieh, hummus, olives, pita, so yummy! The flavors of everything were great and I loved the cilantro sauce and tzatziki sauce.

The hunny got the chicken pita and really liked the flavor of the red chili sauce.

The employees were very nice- as we were eating they checked on us and asked if we liked our food.
Currently operating as a "pop-up" sushi bar, but soon to open permanently in this location. They also have a mobile unit for street fare. Fun!  Running a small fresh sushi menu for now (with PBR for your drinking pleasure), however they intend to expand the menu to include hot Japanese specialties. Exciting! Super cool guys adding to the awesome of PGH. 

For now, it looks like you can catch them at this listed location on Tues. and Wed. from 1-7pm and on Fri. and Sat. from 5-11pm. Then also at Bar Marco on Fridays from 11-3pm and Sunday nights at Shadow Lounge.
So much of me wants to love the Vig and give it an amazing review. After all, it was the first restaurant I ever went to in Phoenix over a year ago when I was here for my interview. Two of my friends took me there. I loved the atmosphere and ambiance. The patio is simply enchanting. 

My favorite is the vig rig that will take you home for free if you don't feel like putting up with their valet, don't feel like parking 8 blocks away because it's the closest you can get, or you are not sober enough to drive home. The ride is free and was gratefully appreciated when we were there with no car to get home.

What keeps me from upping the star level?
** Parking
** Non-memorable food
** Didn't impress me enough to make a note to come back
Olive Garden: more like gringo italian food with bagged salad, bottled dressing, and jarred sauce.  But still not too bad!

Our server was Jason and he was accurate to-the-point & quick.  We got iced tea with has a long spoon- nice touch.  The salad and breadsticks aren't bad but far from homemade.  I mention that that they probably have that yoga mat ingredient that subway got in trouble for.

The salad is decent but they probably have the same exact amount of onions and croutons on every single salad.  The lettuce is crisp and I appreciate the few carrot shreds and 2 pepperccinni.

I get the never ending pasta bowl with angel hair and marinara.  My hunny gets the grilled fish & shrimp.  Our food is quite decent but not exactly chef prepared.  Jason reminds me that I can take a portion home which we do.  I ask how many bowls he's seen people eat of the never ending pasta which he says 5!! 

A sweet lady checks on us we are eating & all the tables nearby.  She was nice & charming to everyone which did add personality to the mediocre food- hence my 4 star rating.
Das Essen hat wie schon immer gut geschmeckt,aber wir( 5 Personen) haben genau 1h30min. auf das Essen gewartet.Dies kam in letzter leider schon paar mal vor.
This was a great venue and amazing club. The reason I am saying OK is that I was outside in a cabana. We had bottle service and the service was brilliant, but it was really hot and outside did not feel like a club atmosphere. The speakers in the cabana were distorted and so you could not put the music up. 
I wish we were inside but it was $5k for a table, and the dance floor was too busy and like a concert with everyone holding up their phones to record Afrojack who was playing. 
Music was incredible, people dancing in the pool and loads of amazing girls, again just being outside did not help with mingling with people. IF you came as a mixed group you would have had a fab time.

All facilities in this place were amazing. I have never seen toilet attendants so diligent, I did not mind tipping them every time I went in.

I think the place gets confused with being a club and a chill out lounge outside. It does both and you have a choice...but only if you can afford it.

Maybe need to go back on a different weekend as it was Independence weekend and so it was super busy.

Apparently some guy inside bought 100 bottles of Dom, and was handing it out. Sums up Vegas hey..!
It was my second time coming here while visiting the boyfriend's family in Wisconsin.  Both times we came as a large group, including 2 young children, so this is probably why service was pretty bad.  Quite slow and unattentive.  

I enjoyed the speciality pizza choices, and my Margharita with extra basil was good.  Everyone else liked theirs as well, and the house\/garden salad looked delicious.  

The restaurant itself is set up on 3 pseudo levels.  The main entrance has several booths and the kitchen, down a couple stairs are a couple tables, and the lower level has more tables, a play area for kids, and bathrooms.  The evening we were there, 2 musicians played Christmas music, which was nice but made the main entrance a little crowded.

Overall, I'd love to come back with a smaller group - I'm guessing the service would improve.
I've been here a few times for lunch uptown. Its nothing amazing but its extremely convenient since its located in the Wells Fargo building. If you're looking for quick and simple lunch, this is the place to come. You can avoid lines and its very quite with a view out the window towards the street.
We were returning from a visit to the 716 and after a full day's drive we returned home hungry. We noticed the lights were on at The Lodge, previously occupied by PJ O'Reilly's and were happy to see fresh new occupants and have they been busy!!! 

New front windows have brightened up the bar area which sports a brand new bar. All new booths and tables compliment the bar, a number of well positioned flat screens and many more comfortable tables. They've  also added outside dining which wasn't open, due to weather but looked to be a great fresh air option. 

Tonight was a "soft opening" so we were fortunate to try a number of menu items. The fried pickles were made in-house and had a crispy well seasoned batter which didn't need any dipping sauce although it came with the app. My Bride ordered the Ruben and was very satisfied. A generous stack of lean corned beef but not enough sauerkraut to her taste. Our server was more that happy to revisit the kitchen for more! I tried the peel 'n eat shrimp app and the shrimp were fresh, well seasoned and a large size. Tasty enough to eat alone although the cocktail sauce was well spiced and tangy. I also tried the Jambalaya Pasta which offered a cream sauce veggie based pasta with shrimp, andouille sausage, mushrooms and chicken. A bit to creamy for my taste but the fresh ingredients will likely please most.

The Staff is a high energy Team, very customer focused from their GM visiting each table to the hostess's warm greeting as well as the super friendly and knowledgeable wait staff. We look forward to the grand opening of The Lodge on July 22. Try it.....you'll like it!

PS: The Lodge also has a family friendly feel all can enjoy!
Roadhouse Cinemas is a slightly better Studio Movie Grill. With a western theme that is slightly tacky and almost looks like it wasn't given a full effort. I came to this place for the first time due to a Groupon. 2 tickets, popcorn, and 2 beers for $21. The price is unbeatable and I will agree that it is an amazing deal. 

The reason this place gets three stars is because it is still a great place to come and so far has been the best Dine-In Movie theater in Arizona I have visited, but the service here is truly lacking. Our drinks took much longer than an acceptable time to arrive. I had to press my call button to check on my drinks before they finally brought them. Server didn't really check on us unless we pressed the call button. I would've ordered more had they checked in. 

The Roadtrip for two is supposed to come with two "fully loaded quesadillas" but what we truly got was about a half of a quesadilla to share. I understand it's happy hour, but at least be more transparent so that people know what to expect when they order. 

The White Cheddar popcorn was a huge bowl of popcorn, I was pleased with it. 

The restroom was decent, one out of order urinal but the urine cakes smelled like they hadn't been replaced in some time.  

Overall, I will be coming back and will be recommending this place, but I hope management sees the large room for improvement here in the service of the wait staff. This place has a big potential to be five stars if their staff is held to a higher standard.
It's a little overwhelming buying school supplies from a list here.  I don't know the difference between an accordion folder and an expanding folder.  They SOUND the same to me.  

You know who does know?  The people that work here, and they were unerringly friendly about it.  

"Yeah, um. . . where are the (finger quote)book socks(end finger quote)?"
"Right here, sir." (he points directly behind me) and over here as well (points down the aisle).

Slight modications to this conversation occur over the visit. . . "Where are the . . . (accordion folders\/erasers\/highlighters\/pencil sharpeners, and so on).

Big back to school sale notwithstanding (I bought six spiral notebooks for $.01 each) I found everything I needed and some stuff I did not.
I have stayed at the JW Marriott twice and had a 1 bedroom suite both times, and being in those suites was so enjoyable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I haven't had any of the food here yet, but the mojitos are amazing!  I came here to see a friend play in a jazz trio, which I really enjoyed, as well.  Will have to try the food sometime when I'm here next...
It's fine.  This place is fine.  

They're slow, yes.  Sometimes you can walk in and stand at the "Please wait to be seated" podium for...five or ten minutes before someone approaches you.  That's probably not fine.  

And Thrillist might list the lobster rolls as one of the 50 things you must try when you're in Pittsburgh...but...maybe just visit some coastal venue.  It's fine.  But that's about it.  

And they serve oysters.  But they don't know what mignonette sauce is.  Which is fine.  You don't HAVE to know what to serve WITH oysters in order to serve oysters.  It's fine.  It's all fine.  

It's pretty clean.  Has outdoor seating.  The food is okay.  I've had better.  I've had worse.  

I wouldn't recommend it.  But I also wouldn't warn anyone off it.  

Three stars if they paid more attention to getting customers seated and staff didn't walk by the "wait to be seated" sign pretending they didn't notice a line of 10 people slowly building.  (I've had more than two experiences with this.  Okay three.  I've seen this happen three times.  Two were ridiculously long waits.  One was fine.)
I have struggled to find a dentist office to go to since moving to las vegas ten years ago. Then I found this one. I am always treated well and not made to feel like I have to pay for all those extras that happen to not be covered by insurance.
I love this office
Brand new joint on spring mountain... Absolutely love it!! Tried sea urchin tomato cream pasta & miso carbonara and both were to die for. OK, I guess it's a bit pricey for pasta, but I can't think of anywhere else to eat this kind of food in this town, so I am not complaining... besides, portion is fairly large. Server is attentive, chefs are friendly. Will definitely repeat until i conquer every items on the menu - great alternatives when Ichiza or Monta is just too busy to seat you immediately. No signs outside yet... it's on the same mall as Monta & Raku. Give it a try!
My niece and brother-in-law were both falsely accused of shoplifting on Christmas Eve. It was very embarrassing and degrading for my niece to have a team of 5 people surrounding her and looking through her bags to find nothing. Then once they went through her bags they started with my brother-in-law. The only thing he was guilty of is purchasing a piece of crap pair of earrings from your jewelry counter. So after being humiliated and producing a receipt to show he just purchased the earrings they didn't even have the decency to apologize. Sorry great people of Strongsville Walmart, The African American girl you decided to pick on this evening works very hard and is not a thief. Plus she has family members that work for Walmart and they have advised her how to handle your AP Department for not following protocol that evening. Corporate will be called on the incident. In the meantime, people of color should  beware when shopping in this store you could be harassed for no reason.
I am here for a conference stayed one night and am looking for another hotel.  Rooms are nice, bed is very comfortable, but they are nothing special. No in-room coffee maker.    The staff is another story.  So far they have been unhelpful and some down right rude. When I drove up there were several Bell man, but no one came to help me.  I had to go to the bell desk and ask for help.  (I should add that I have a broken ankle and leg in a boot) During check-in I specifically asked for a room with a view.  I was given a room with a view of the front roof. I could seriously ONLY see the roof of the front overhand.  I called down to change rooms and no one answered the phone ever. I had to walk back down to the Lobby.  When I changed rooms I left something back in the other room and needed to have security let me in.  He was so rude it was shocking.  I said something apologizing for the inconvenience and he literally turned his head and did not say one word. I repeated myself b\/c I thought he must not have heard me and he did the same thing.  No smile, no that's okay ma'am, nothing. No handicap accessible self-parking. Self-parking garage was full due to a prom at the hotel and several hundred yards away. VERY disappointed.
Love the Burned down Brown or Magellan which is a spiced version .. great beers and you should try one !!
Quaint, friendly, and delicious! This is a hidden gem in the Gilbert area. Yummy sandwiches that are handcrafted with love! Fresh meats that a shaved to order, and enormous salads that would be easily shared by two. A sweet guy named Sam greeted us at the door immediately as we walked in, and my heart melted as everyone treated me like family. I ordered the chopped salad and was shocked at the generous portion. My sons ordered the grilled cheese which came with chips and a fresh dill pickle. Loved the shabby chic decor and all the friendly faces. Oh! And the cookies are delicious and fresh baked!! I hope word gets out about this local lunch spot.
I took our family here for my boyfriend's birthday celebration which was a Sunday night. There were 11 of us in our group and only 5 of us opted for the AYCE while the others just ordered from the a la carte menu. So imagine how crazy that can get. I love my family but to be honest, they can be a bit difficult sometimes. The staff handled everyone's orders so well. Even though the restaurant was packed everyone in our group felt well taken care of by the staff. 

To top it all of, everyone love their sushi. No complaint here on our end. Thank you, Jjanga family for taking care of us last night and kudos to everyone!
make your own! mix beef chicken and noodles and a few veggies! and then create your very own flavor!. 

i get the large bowl and a to go box. fill it with beef and push it down with the wax paper. and keep stuffing meat in to the top. the pile on some veggies and pile up a huge mound of noodles! my bowl sits aleast 12-16 inches high!! but the key is to go and grab another lg bowl up where they make your food! this bowl you fill with your own sauce!! then hand them both bowls and its on!!! if you do it the way i said you will have a bowl and a to box filled to the rim! and eat it all day lol
As sushi goes-very good. We had five rolls- Spicy Tuna, Rock and Roll, Yellow Tail, First Date, and the Dragon Roll. They were all delicious. The ambiance was pretty good and the service wasn't too bad-a little slow to start out with. The ginger salad was just odd. My husband and I couldn't quite put our finger on it but it was just odd. The miso soup didn't have any seaweed in it at all. I'm not saying it was understated, I'm saying there was absolutely nothing green in there and it was very salty. 

Since we went there for sushi and the sushi was great we can't really complain.
I would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars, but since that's not possible, I'm rounding down. 

I went here for Sunday lunch with a group for Winterlicious. For $15 we got a choice of appetizer, entree and dessert. 

We arrived first and our table was waiting for us. The restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu.

Once our party finally arrived we all ordered. I had their Chipotle Sweet Potato & Goat Cheese Dip, which was average. The salads looked much better and got better reviews. Same with the soup. The dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle. The dip was good, the pickled cauliflower alright. It was nice when all combined on the crostini (pickled veggies, dip on top of crostini). 

I had originally wanted to order the double pork slider, but I saw it arrive at someone else's table and it was literally just the one, single mini pork sandwich, with a few thinly cut fries at the side. It looked good, but it was appetizer size, IF THAT. The chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized, so I ordered that. It was good. I really liked the bread. The macaroni was also more reasonably sized. I sampled it and it was fine. Didn't blow me away. 

Dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone I think. Some people ordered the mousse, which I thought was fine, but the people who ordered it loved, so there you have it. My husband loved his apple terrine, which I tried and was good. I liked the flavour of my creme brule very much, but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin, hard candy. It was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth. 

The service was consistently good, so no complaints there. None of us had wine with our lunch (although some had other drinks), so I can't comment there. 

This is a tapas bar, so I expect sizes to be small. BUT when sizes are small I expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions. They gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually. These would all be hard to share and wouldn't really be worth it. They are nice as a Winterlicious meal, but I'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to.
This was my first time ever in the side of a Hobby Lobby. I had to pick up a few things and thought this place might have them. It did.

Very large store they have everything here.  The store was clean and the staff was friendly.

I'll definitely keep this place in mind for next time I need something they might carry.
Parking is far ( although another Yelper told me theres free valet =) +1  )and you have to walk through the mall with all your luggage. And well - check-in is horrible if you're travelling in a big group. There is no where to sit! It was kind of odd posting just in the empty space behind the line. The elevators to the rooms are camoflauged pretty well. Aesthetically nice, drunkenly not nice.

The hallways are nice - the wallpaper modern and pretty. We stayed in the Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen room. Our room memorablilia was Michelle Tanner's overalls. It was nice - I loved that show.

The double pool is nice, we were able to choose to sun where the bachelor\/bachelorette parties were nursing hangovers, or where there were kids splashing about.

It was a good location, lots of things to do - I met up with my friends and the kids that live in Vegas at the mall and grabbed a bite. and the heart bar was cool. I would stay here again with family.
The standard for decor and atmosphere for Montreal dumpling places is unfortunately low. HarBin shines out as a beacon within a land of despair with its stylish and cool interior. 

The service was quick and the waitress gave us great recommendations. The dumpling skins were soft, flavourful and the perfect thickness. My advice to vegetarians is go for the tofu&veggie dumplings! They were much better than the egg&chive. The pork & coriander dumplings were also a hit. The only bummer was that the filling in all the dumplings we got were slightly soggy so water started sogging out by the last few dumplings. 

Polish off the whole experience with a pot of jasmine tea. It's the best remedy for a cold winter ; dumplings and freshly brewed tea.
I would really give 3.5 stars but decided to be generous with 4. We went on a weeknight and were seated right away. Place has trivia to play on your phone so my boyfriend loved that and it was fun to play a game while eating\/drinking. Our servers were pleasant and nice, chips and salsas came out right away. Love the chips and salsa, as well as the homemade bean dip! I could eat an insane amount of these! 

The menu has a lot of options to choose and I went with the chicken fajitas. Food came out quick and was hot! I wasn't a huge fan of the seasoning that was cooked with the fajitas, a little spicy for my taste. Rice and beans were delicious, too bad they charge an extra $1.25 for sour cream and guacamole. The margarita was also really good but $10. 

I haven't been on taco Tuesday but am interested in checking it out!
Where do I begin?.... 

I stayed here last week for my vacation, not at all what I expected the service and people are not worth the price.  They have no idea what customer service means, only the front desk do unfortunately.  If it weren't for the front desk I would give it 1 star only.

I went to the concierge to ask for a great  Italian restaurant for lunch.  Unfortunately concierge recommended a restaurant they haven't eaten because the food was horrible you can read it from my other review Dal Toro, don't go there please. 

I went back to concierge after lunch to ask where can we sit since we are waiting to check in and it's not 3pm yet.  A lady told me there is no sitting area, we have to go to a cafe.  I thought this is odd, a big hotel like this no seating area. I can't bring my kid to the gaming area, this is why I need a place for her. I found at least 3 areas on my own, thanks for nothing... 

I got to my room, the cheese crumbs was still on the couch.  My hubby is nice enough to clean.  We had to wait 2 hrs for our luggage from the bell boys. REALLY!!! My husband had to call to ask them about it. 

We ended up sleeping in a comforter that was wrapped with a fitted sheet, which means no comforter cover and no sheets. We got hot at night and realized there was no sheets... The next day I asked a house keeper is it normal they don't provide sheets for the bed. It turns out my room wasn't clean.  Oh great mind you I took a bath and used the bathroom too. Now I am really disgusted.  

The housekeeper told me he will talk to the manager for me. They offer to clean my room ASAP. It turns out the room was clean and the new sheets had stains on it. 

I had it and went to the front desk and told an associate of my dilemmas with the hotel. She apologized and comp me $75.  Really for how much crap I endured with my family $75 should be fine. I didn't really care at this point, I will never go back. 

The next house keeper changed the sheets and told me she couldn't give me new wine glasses and that I have to call priority desk. OMG! 

The rest of the time the guests that stay here are nicer than the staff.  The guests would  greet each other, but the staff don't greet you even when you talk to them.  It's like your inconveniencing them!!!

The hotel is beautiful.  Next time I will only stay at the Wynn.
I love Settebello! Napoli style pizza rocks my socks off! Get the Diavola pizza if you like spicy! Mmmm
Very impressed. They have a gluten free menu & they offer a burger with a lettuce bun option & broccoli instead of fries!!! I got the house salad with steak and it was phenomenal. For less healthy option, they have the best Rueben in Charlotte!!!! Cool beers on tap.
The only thing I hate about this place is how many times I should be going there for lunch and forget about it. 

We've ordered takeout here for work on several occasions, and just recently I was able to eat at Defalco's for the first time. What I've realized? The line is absolutely well worth it. I've tried to order a different sandwich every time and every time it's been just as amazing as the last, if not better.

I love how the line goes through the store, allowing you to see all the wines, beer options, foods you can buy and the deli section in slow motion before you make it to the counter. Next time I am definitely getting the German potato salad!

Two minor issues I had with eating in last time:
1)  One of the displayed beers, a microbrew I look forward to every year, wasn't actually available.
2) Upon going up to the counter to get a refill on my beverage the man taking orders was very upset. He told me the people in the line were gonna come after me. And I'll stop there. I think this took longer than actually refilling my drink.
The line is always long on Saturdays and Sundays from 10-12. So expect to wait just a little while if you want to go on those days.
I would say that the food is okay, although I have had better. The service is so quick, which is really nice when I am hungry in the morning.
I should order something that they are known for in order to give them a better rating.
So first of all, I would like to say that I will NOT be speaking on the food. Now... As far as the Bar and drinks go? Unfortunately I have to say its pretty mediocre... A standard college bar with standard college people with standard college crowding. Not very original, but great drinks prices. Now... what it does have going for it? Great drink prices... and a great Patio. Not a lot of downtown bars have private patio seating. It is fantastic! Now it still gets pretty crowded even on the Patio but it is still great fun. 

Still a great place for a bit of fun, cheap drinks, and some fun with the local college people.
This place was absolutely fantastic! After reading both good & bad reviews about this place on yelp me & my husband decided to take a chance with this steakhouse. I was a little worried me being a african American girl I read a review that said this place was racist against black ppl. Absolutely Not! I got a different vibe from them. My husband is italian & although I did feel like the host at the front door who greeted us upon arrival & sat us down @ our seats was a little weird.  When she told us to enjoy our dinner she only told it to him not me, I mean literally looking him in his face, I almost felt imaginary lol. Idk maybe I was being too sensitive. Then when she sat us down she asked us if we wanted the small table sat for 2 or a bigger table set for 4. We choose the bigger table because the table for two was more for a table of 1 once you have food on it. We had to wait for the table to be cleaned off and set. We saw napkins forks & knives set on the table so my husband asked the lady if we could have a seat now, she then sarcastically said "glasses" as if he was dumb for not knowing that. After the table was set we had a seat & the lady apologized for the table not being ready upon our arrival. Our server was very nice & polite always checking up on us. I can't stand when your @ a resturant  & you have to look all over  for your sever. That was definitely not the case here. The food was excellent I got the brick chicken & my husband got the bone in rib eye steak. I'm usually not a steak person, like I don't even like Fogo De Chao. But the steak here @ this place was phenomenal!  I had the brick chicken & it was delicious so much flavor! Will definitely be back to visit this place next time I'm in Vegas! Go! You will not be disappointed
It reminded me of the dirty restroom at the gas station on HWY 40 driving through Texas. Dirty and nasty.
I preffer target great lands to some other super centers because it's clean, the employees seem more helpful and I don't feel like I going to robbed while shopping
After my coworkers and I claiming a million times we were going to go to the interesting place behind Fiesta Burrito, it took a friend being in the area and proclaiming its glory for me to head over after work one day for a quick impromptu meetup. 

It was well worth it.

Talk about a million different types of sodas for almost every desire humanly possible. Most of them are not cold and in a few aisles across the store. A select few are cold in the coolers in the back and ready to drink on the spot. I headed straight to the back and decided on one of the ginger beers, which ended up being a great choice. It was just a little over a dollar, and I was asked if I wanted a straw as I paid for it. Um yes, I heart all accessories.... even beverage ones such as straws. 

They have some seats outside in case you want to sit and enjoy some Scottsdale people watching. The staff is very friendly and helpful also. 

Warning that there is a $5 purchase limit to use a credit\/debit card.

I will definitely be back. My only real wish is that the inside was more inviting. I didn't feel persuaded to browse the aisles and instead went straight for the cold selection.
I met a girlfriend for lunch and was pleasantly surprised with the sushi selection. I got the pure pear martini and it was amazing! A great local place to grab a cocktail and dinner.
after being in disgusting tequilera or taqueria pronto! mexican food definitely need a drink specially since this places are all disgusting.  i have a bitter taste in my mouth after ordering eating half my food before i throw it away. disgusting restaurant.

this bar people is very friendly drinks are very good good price good service deserves good tip always. i recommended for all of you don't have an idea what to eat or drink well this is the place something fast.
This is an ok dinner option at The Palms. The decor inside is cool. The service is ok. The food is solid. The prices seem ok. It adds up in a hurry though, especially if you add appetizers or sides.

We ordered several options for our table so we could try more things. I tried a little bit of the following; General Tao's Chicken, Boiled Beef Tenderloin in Spicy Szechuan Sauce, Kung Pao Beef Tenderloin American Style and the white rice. Each was ok. None of them stood out as being exceptional or bad.

The time we were there it was not busy so reservations were not needed. During weekends or peak times you will want to make reservations though.
I think AMC has snagged me ever since I got sucked into paying to be a Stubs Reward member~ the thing is, they do make getting rewarded easy so I find myself picking AMC theatres over Harkins lately.
Location is convenient, right off of Tatum and the 101.  Parking can be a bit of a nightmare as Desert Ridge is a popular mall.
The trick is to drive north on Tatum and then turn right on Deer Valley then turn right I can't remember the name of the street but then you can drive straight to the AMC and miss all the internal traffic that is part of Desert Ridge.
$5 matinee movies can't be beat either!
Aggressively remodeling this old store.  I came here to pass the time while I waited for another store to open. They had some great deals of which I partook.  This may have been a hub of commerce 20 years ago but it appears that that hub has moved up the street. I hope it's worth the remodel.
Its good stuff but i dont understand the hype? its all very fresh, taste good but not the best. better than any other fast food burger place. and its cheap! milkshake is good! i do love the fires tho! i love onions but not theres, its just to dam much! just good fast cheap food!
I really loved all the pop-up shops for Christmas this year. I ended up getting most of my gifts at them. This one was no different. The organizers did a great job transforming Atherton Market in to a holiday shop full of local vendors. Nikki was on hand with her adorable dimples and a smores bar! Triple C was pouring beers and Not Just Coffee was slanging caffeinated beverages. Looking forward to next year!
My favorite place to get pizza and beer with friends in Tempe. This place has a tendency to get busy and parking is terrible, though, so try to go during not peak times, and definitely carpool or ride share.
Holy Macaroon!!! Do yourself a favor and get your butt down to barChocolate in the 7th St Market today!! The hazelnut crunch macaroon is phenomenal!! And get more than one... at $2.50 a piece, why not!
I've had many burgers. I've tried those crazy burgers like Dangerous Dan's Quadruple C, the Burger Priests.. Don't remember what it was called and this place is hands down the best burger place I've had. The burger is tasty and fresh. Their poutine is flavourful and not overly cheesy. They put the right amount of gravy to make one of the best poutines in town. 
Their prices are very reasonable. I can never get it when I pay close to $20 for a burger, fries and drink. It's a burger combo for petes sake.
I will be dropping by quite often. My brother first recommended this place and now we both love it.
J'ai  été là    pour     bruncher  avec  un  groupe  d'amis    Verdict  !!! C'était  super  bon  !!  Il  y a beaucoup de variété  dans le  menus   :   J'y  retourne  c'est  mes  amis   qui  ont  aussi  adorés !!!
I asked for extra sauce and got zero sauce shows this place is a complete bag of ass I do not recommend it to anyone
WORST experience EVER!!!!! never have i ate anywhere to the level of grossness this place offered. They actually served me garbage for food. I ordered a chicken sandwich i got to work took the bun off put some ketchup then took a bite of my burger it was so stale and hard i immediately spit it out. So after being in shock of what just happened i took the bun off once again and saw some of my lettuce was black. And the worst part it that the chicken patty was grey with some spots of meat missing inside its really hard to explain when i called the manager she really was not too concerned with the quality offered me to remake the burger . I couldn't possibly eat at that location again. She then offered me a free burger coupon i had to go and pick it up at the carls jr. So when i got there i went inside for my refund and it was not the best looking inside either all the employees seemed to not even care that they served me that and they gave me a small fountain cup while i waited and the soda was flat. I then realized the problem is with management and not running that location right.  Lack of employee quality.   you can even see how  stiff the chicken looks on the pictures i took.
Food (lunch) was decent but hardly memorable. And this review is written within one hour of paying.  Service was extremely slow, as I think there's only one or two waiters scrambling around in the restaurant.  Management really needs to step it up and schedule its staff better... Lunch took about two hours because everything took so long. Six empty cups and we had to work hard to flag down another waiter, as ours failed to check in for so long.  Waiter later threw down desert menus without even looking at us. Came back ten minutes later to throw.down plates as if he were dealing cards in the casino floor. I dont recall any eye contact the whole time... To avoid seeing the obvious disappointment in our eyes? 

Watch your bill carefully, one of our entrees was priced $10 more than on the menu. This could have been missed easily because of the way they individually divided and repriced items on the set menu.
So far it's been 1.5 hours and the sushi still has not arrived. I ordered chicken bulgogi and they bring out beef without telling me they ran out of chicken and would only comp 10% on food I didn't want.  It is very loud and drunk people screaming and cursing while kids sit near causing people to leave.  The table next to us has been waiting even longer then us and they are still waiting.  I do not recommend this place as far as service goes.  I couldn't tell you the quality of the food because it never made it out.
So in love with cost plus for stationary, home decor, wine, kitchen gadgets, and non perishable international snacks.  My go to for stocking stuffers and the only spot to find something for guys & gals alike.

I visited this location for a change- I typically go to the one at camelback & 18th street.

For coworker gifts I grabbed some mini-wines and single serve shortbread cookies. Vintage bottles sodas galore to throw in ice on Christmas Day that family will enjoy.  I found a mug for my uncle as well as lobster pate for his stocking.  I found gourmet wrapped soaps and a Christmas dish towel for my mom.

While I was shopping an associate offered me help with finding anything.  

The line was fairly quick but I could tell the cashier seemed overwhelmed by the cart of goodies I had to check out. Granted her counter is tiny- Sorry for buying so much!!!!  Seems like that should be a good thing?? Maybe Kim should have called a backup cashier when she saw my selections because a long line did form and she ended up showing her stress.
I travel a lot and I ask around for a good restaurant a taxi driver told me about this place I went to eat and was awesome best restaurant in Vegas great service fresh food a lot food quality food if you travel to Las Vegas you have to eat in This place I recommend this restaurant to few friends and they told me best in Vegas live music family owed restaurant I come back to Las Vegas and I come back to Thai restaurant the waitress was great they treat you like family and we have to tell her don't bring more food basically they give me tortillas for free and nachos thanks mariscos islitas
We do most of our grocery shopping later at night when we get off work (11pm-1am ish) and this Walmart never ceases to annoy me.  The overnight crew are so rude.  The cashiers are usually nice, but the people on the floor are  rude and inconsiderate.  Its a normal occurrence to just be run down but someone pulling a cart of items to be restocked.  And I'm not kidding.  It happens multiple times every time we visit at night.  And don't even THINK about browsing for something near a shelf they are stocking.  If you do, be ready for the sighs, the irritability, and the dirty looks.  The older ladies who work the registers are almost always friendly once you get to them (because you'll have to wait in line for at least 15 minutes, that's a given).
The good: Very nice setup, amazing view, the chip ball technology, the game setup, TV's in each bay, music\/lighting.

The OK:  Food was just OK, I can't help but relate it to being at the Brunswick Zone XL, it was good but not amazing.

The bad:  Price.  We were there for 2 hours with 3 people, we golfed and ate, it was $225.  I understand if we're on a nice N. Scottsdale course and we spend $100+ a pop for a round of golf and some drinks but to spend this much at a driving range just doesn't seem right.  I most closely relate this to high-class bowling and I can't see spending this much on a regular basis.

TIP:  Don't hit it too far, if you hit over the net they will know it was your ball that broke that car window.  This didn't happen to us but that is what they mentioned.  It seems impossible but a 250 yard high drive will do it.
Long wait for boring Mexican-ish food on styrofoam plates.

This is a mix between chipotle (ordering system) filibertos (styrofoam plates & cups-  not Eco-friendly) and street cart food.

I had the fish tacos- not good. The fish did not have a grilled appearance or taste and was a bit mushy.  Super lame pre-shredded cheese at this spot detracts from the quality as well as gross chips & nasty tortillas.

The same day I went here I went to happy hour at crescent ballroom and had amazzzzing fish tacos for $2 each that had flaky seasoned real grilled fish not this limp frozen mush.  I didn't realized how gross it was until 5 hours later at happy hour.  I must have ordered the same thing twice in 1 day because of how forgettable my lunch was.

Side of guacamole is super small!  This stingy cheap restaurant will not see me return.
Awful experience. 
We arrived a little before midnight and the host looked like he was not in the mood to work. We asked for a place for two and my husband asked about being sitted where they set the food on fire, excuse my memory but I can't remember the name of that place but I know it's not the bar, and the host looked like he didn't like us asking, he looked really unhappy. Asked us for a moment and then came back to walk us there. Everybody looked like they were not happy to see us and nobody said hello or smiled at us. Just a reminder, it's not  "all you can eat", it wasn't happy hour time and the place is expensive, so if we were still willing to have dinner there I would appreciate not feeling like  we were not welcome or bothering them.
We sat down but I immediately asked my husband if we could go somewhere else, such a heavy vibe.
Nobody but the host said goodbye either. Zero appreciation.
We crossed the parking lot and went to sushi way, which is cheaper, has the "all you can eat" option and a very friendly staff.
Was here with my mom a while back and we fell in love. The coconut pancakes were killer. Definitely will be back!
Cookies! I love cookies! My claim to fame is once finishing a full pack of rainbow chips ahoy during the course of a movie. Gross? some say yes, I say delicious.

So I'm a big cookie fan, and never knew of this place, and it's right around the corner from my house. WTH, why wasn't this place in my life earlier. This place is great!

Each cookie is about $1, and they're not big (about the size of a chips ahoy cookie - except square) but the price is justified because some of these little things are scrumptiously delicious. 

My favorites so far are the cinnamon bun cookie (yes, you read that right), the double ginger cookie and their own take on an oreo. They have another huge array of shortbreads, and a carrot cake whoopie that looks (and I hear is) amazing. 

They also do wedding arrangements (this is actually how I found it, a friend asked me to come by to get a sample pack for him).
Let me preface this review by writing that I LOVE everyone that work at or is part of Dearing Studio. I love Brian Sweeney who is such a genuine person and will go out of his way to teach you or make you happy. They have great acting classes, great location, flexible pricing and is supportive of the acting community. 
Why 4 stars and not 5?  For the fact that both of the classes that I took,
the teacher has not stayed consistent throughout the duration of the course. 
One class had so many subs from week to week, I forgot who my original teacher was suppose to be. The other one listed one instructor (and the reason I decided to take the class), another instructor taught the first class (needless to say I was very disappointed) then a different instructor taught the remaining classes. 
If they can iron these details out, then I would gladly give them 5 stars!!
Let me start by saying, if I could give them 0 stars, I would. 1 star is being generous. This is the second time we've had issues with this store and after the time, we stopped ordering for a while but then after about 8 months decided to give them another try. What a mistake. WHAT. A. MISTAKE. they forgot our soda (which happened to be the root of the problem the last time as well), we were told they'd be back with it in an hour. Now, that right there is absurd to me... An hour?! I ordered the soda to go WITH my pizza.. I mean, really?? OK, so an hour comes an goes, we call back and are told that the delivery driver just came and got it and it on his way. A half hour later.. You guessed it, still no soda (we live a mile away, FYI). So we call yet again. The 'shift leader' answers and wants to know who told us he was on his way.. Well, as much as I like to make it a habit to learn all the names of the employees of surrounding businesses, we didn't know who this person was. So let's skip to the real reason for this review. Although there are LOTS of things I could write about and truthfully, probably should, what prompted me to write this review was that the lady on the other end of the phone dropped the F bomb at my husband. And not just once or twice, no no, about 6 times. Was he heated? Yes. I'm not saying he was a doll about the whole thing. But she started swearing and threatening to call the cops on him because he said he was going to just come get it himself. Seriously. Just never ever again. Never. Ever. All we wanted was a soda!
Our poor server.. we were a group of 10 or 11, and I'll be the firs to admit it- we were obnoxious.  I'm sure within minutes he was annoyed with us, but hey, we were a group of friends celebrating a birthday and enjoying ourselves.  So, on with my review!

We started at the bar where we waited for some of our group to arrive as we were the first there.  The drinks were really great, but our bartenders lacked so much personality that it was sickening.  I dont know why, but we seemed to be an utter annoyance to the guy serving us, and at this point we were just 3 or 4 people sitting at a bar ordering cocktails, so I'm not sure what the attitude was about, but whatever.  We paid our tab and went to our table.

Once we were seated, we had a really good experience for the most part.  Our service was great I thought (bless that poor man! haha!), and I really enjoyed everything I ordered.  The carrott soup was incredible, and my entree was delicious.  In my opinion, considering how loud and difficult I'm sure we were, our server did a great job and I never really felt like he was burdened or impatient with us.  We sat in a semi-private area (thank God) which was really nice, for us and those around us, and it was the perfect setting for our group.  

The valet parking situation could be improved, but I dont really have any complaints- it just seems like there may be a more efficient way to do it and the waiting space and valet stand is really cramped and can get uncomfortable if there are a lot of people waiting.  There seems to be plenty of self parking available, but valet is really reasonable and makes it easy.
Dominos pizza is pretty good, but the Lakewood, OH location has terrible service. When I went in for pick-up, I was ignored because they had so many deliveries. Then, when I went to pay, the cashier kept my change. That was awkward.
Most recently, I got an e-mail for 20% off entire order with online delivery (the headline said "we miss you!") So of course there's an error message prompting us to call the restaurant, where ultimately our order went from $40 to $49, after the manager explained they were out of pineapples and would not honor our coupon (after their worker said they would). We ended up cancelling our order and going to another local pizza place. Dominos as a whole has done a great job of improving their menu and recipes, but my local spot is too disappointing to try again.
Not sure why we haven't stayed at Encore before but stayed here this past weekend on a trip out to sin city.  

The hotel was nice and clean and though the hotel has been open for a few years I did not see much wear and tear.  It's nice to be able to stay at a hotel that actually maintains their rooms.  The total experience was much more pleasant that my normal go to hotel of choice (Palazzo).  Encore's rooms were 100x better than what Aria offers and though I haven't stayed at Cosmo yet, I'd say Encore may be my new choice when stopping by Vegas.  What's also nice is that your room key also serves as your player's card so that I don't have to carry too many cards with me when gambling.  I haven't gambled at Wynn in a few years so naturally I've lost all my comps.  It was also nice to see a few craps tables with lower limits here along at Wynn.  Strolling back from dinner, you'll also see quite a view of the talent featured at their clubs ;-) which just an added bonus.  Will probably be back for another stay in the near future.
Definitely a diverse shop. Pictures of MLB players line the walls. There was a TV tuned to ESPN. There were eight chairs but only three people cutting. There was no shortage of customers. We walked in at the right time as the wait was less than 10 minutes. The wait was probably at least 1 hour long by the time we walked out. The prices for haircuts range from $12-18. They also offer other services like hot towel shaves. Results: Not the best haircut but it's passable. They are open on Sundays, which is a big plus.
Several years ago I decided to stop at this cute little grocery store in the South Hills called McGinnis Sisters.  Little did I know this store would help me find great quality cuts of meat (try the bacon from the meat counter when they have it!), fresh breads, artisan cheeses, great quality coffee.  I was smitten.  It was through this store I developed my love of cooking.  Time (and work) took me away from Pittsburgh for a few years but now I am back.

A lot can be said about the Whole Paycheck stores popping up around Pittsburgh as well as the butchers in the East End (I will never go there) that have become trendy since I've left.  I'm just not interested in going to these stores as I like my "tried and trusted" stores in Pittsburgh.  McGinnis Sisters is one of them.

I recently visited my trusted store and had a sub-par experience with a cut of pork.  I wasn't sure what to do, honestly, as I never expected to have this experience...  I emailed them to let them know of a wonky butcher experience (his description of the product was less than steller) as well as my cut of pork shoulder.  Wow.  I could not be more impressed with their customer service and dedication to their product.  They aren't just selling product, they BELIEVE in their product.  They offered to replace the pork shoulder and to work with their Meat Department manager to make it right.  

When I returned to the store, the wonky butcher was there (this time he coughed into his glove and I'm pretty sure he didn't change it) but the other guys behind the counter were SO QUICK to help me.  I brought in the leftover pork and they replaced it, no questions asked.  I really do love McGinnis Sister's and try to talk them up whenever possible.  I love that they carry milk from Brunton Dairy.  I love their fresh bread (I got both on this second trip) and their seafood is still as fresh as I remember.  My second go-round with my pork was phenomenal.  Thank you all for a great experience!
Lots of fun for the family. The only downside is the horses eat lots of burritos and rip major poo wind. Also to get your horse to go faster download the indiana jones pocket whip.
First time here for a lunch meeting.  I had the chicken cheesesteak "pizza style" with marinara and pepperoni and it was phenomenal.  A bit on the greasy side and that left me feeling full well into the evening but overall it was exactly what I was looking for.
Came here on a Friday night and it didn't look too busy but had to wait over 30 minutes for the food. Ordered the fish bao, pork belly bao, and the kimchi fries.  The price was reasonable (under $5 for a bao).  It wasn't really filling, but would make for a great snack.  The pork belly was really fat with very little meat so I wasn't a big fan on this one.  The fish bao however, was very crispy and hot with lots of coleslaw, would recommend everyone to try this one.  The Kimchi fries were mediocre, the sauce and kimchi was a good touch however I didn't really enjoy the fries. All in all, it's a decent place for a small snack and I would come back once in awhile.
Its good pizza. My kids love their anchovy pizzas. Their pizzas are great becuase of the dough, their ovens and equally the sauce. Anyway you order it, it'll be good.
Decent fast food pizza. Better than a Pizza Hut or Dominos but not sure that is saying a ton. Very kid friendly as the pizzas are customizable to whatever the kids want. Decent variety of toppings and they basically use a thin crust which I prefer. 

Affordable, which you expect for this kind of place. I am a west coaster not sure how widespread this franchise is, but I would return if I am back in town and needed a quick pizza fix to take back to my hotel room.
LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!

Publix is simply amazing. It is exactly what grocery shopping should feel like. I hate walking in to a Walmart. Sure, prices are cheap, but everything feels dirty and the employees hate life. It is a miserable experience. Publix is the exact opposite. Super clean, well lit, organized, and full of smiling employees... What's not to love! The prices are a bit higher than Wally World, but the quality and upgraded shopping experience are well worth the extra pennies. They also have an amazing deli bar with Boar's Head Meats.
There are three Starbucks here in the Valley that I go to on a regular basis and the service is consistent as is the product. This location is one of them. The staff is awesome, the manager, Terry (sorry if I spelled her name wrong!) is on the ball and and has a well trained, oiled team. I can not say enough great things about this Starbucks.
Very professional, clean and great customer service. They give you a really nice discount on your first visit. I'll definitely return!
Maria our server this afternoon is an absolute pleasure! Attentive and always had a smile on her face!
How great was this place? A bar in the lobby\/lounge while you wait for you movie! A dining menu once you get seated inside the movie theater. BTW, for those that don't know, you can block your desired seat online, just like when getting your desired seat on an airplane. You even have at your seat a silent buzzer to alert an attendant to come and assist with your dining needs during the movie. The only thing that was a little bit distracting was the wait staff when they did come thru during the movie. But, that's the price you pay for having a dining service. The one other thing I'll mention is that its not crowded and noisy like a traditional movie house. Sweet!
Fantastic dentist and supporting staff. I called Dr. Ghorshi's office and Joan set me up with an appointment. She was incredibly understanding of my schedule and found me a time that would work. I went in and met Dr. Ghorshi. He was wonderful. He tends to be more conservative with treatment and truly wants what is best. I couldn't recommend this office more!
Note: This was the first official opening night.

I was very optimistic about Loft & Cellar. Great use of the space, close to a lot of things uptown, good concept.  I brought my cousin and a friend who were in town. Overall, I thought it was a good experience but not a great experience...and honestly, something that may be a bit too much for Charlotte.

First, we were there an hour after they opened. They asked if we had reservations. They literally opened for the first time ever an hour ago. No, we did not, but the place was empty so there was no problem getting a table. The menu is setup so you can experience "a movie or a play." Exposition - Rising Action - Crescendo - Resolution. Ok, I'm cool with that concept. But it's difficult to tell what everything is on the menu, even if you're somewhat of a foodie. Second...the drink menu is literally a book and the food menu is one page.

I had a pisco sour drink - which, admittedly, was delicious. They intend for that to be their signature drink and I believe it will be!

Our group ordered the Reuben Tartare (yummy but bread heavy), the Lomi Lomi (good but tasted of mayonnaise), beets bravas (not too bad...but still beets), Duck Brunswick Gyoza (the best dish of the evening!), Souther Pad Thai (bland bland bland), and the Pickey Eater with chicken (sufficient but expensive).

Overall, a good experience for their first night, but not a place I will return to for a lot of food options. If it is to be successful, it will be either more as a bar, or they will need to expand\/broaden\/simplify the food to make it more accessible to the non-foodies.
I wished the tuna Panini had more tuna in it it was very thin and I wish it had more flavors, $8 plus, for this after tax and tip. I thought it was overpriced for what it was. The cheesy biscuit tasted delicious. Wish we tried some of the pastries too.
USPS, FedEx and UPS services all in one place! They'll even do the packing for you, if needed. Super convenient and waaay more pleasant than the East Liberty Post Office.  I often leave with a feeling of nostalgia for old fashioned family business', something I'll never get from the kids at the FedEx counter. Even so, I wouldn't go out of my way to spend extra to ship from A & A, but it's great when you're in the neighborhood and\/or need to ship from multiple carriers. And it's usually a quick stop. They've even come to pick up some unwieldy boxes from my workplace to send out. A+!
This is a great place with a cool atmosphere. It sort of has a retro\/modern feel to it. They have a bunch of dart boards in the back which is always fun, good drink specials, some nice booths to hang out in and a great patio area. This is a place everyone should definitely experience a couple times. Also, I have never had the food here so I can't really speak on that.
Love LOve LOVe LOVE this place! Everything I had was amazing!! 

We started off with an array of different appetizers - the list consisted of various different pizzas, grown up pigs in a blanket, mini crab cakes, fried calamari, and this little fried mushroom and rice balls (I don't know the proper names). My favorite would be the fried calamari - it's salt and pepper calamari with rock shrimp and then topped with a sweet Thai chili sauce. It has that spicy kick to it! My second favorite was the dish I didn't know the name of (little fired mushroom and rice balls). They were so packed with flavor, that every bit I took I felt like my mouth was about to explode.

When it came to dinner, even though I was super full, I had the lobster roll sandwich which came with a side of fries. The lobster roll sandwich was good and  huge. If I could only make a slight change, it would to have them put a little less of the mayo on the dish. Other than that it was really really good. So good that even though I was stuffed after the first bit, I pushed myself to eat one half of the sandwhich and then eat the other halfs lobter only. As far as the fries are concerned, they were made just how I like them. Super thin, crispy, and covered in salt and pepper. They reminded me of a better version of McDonald's. (I know I know I shouldn't compare these two places, but I do love there fries...Sorry).

As far as dessert, we had another array of desserts. Now even though I was super stuffed, I had a little bit of room for a taste test. We had apple strudel. mini chocolate donuts filled with camel, strawberry souffle, and a smore cake. My favorite was the smore came. Graham cracker bottom, dark chocolate fudge middle, and then topped off with a torched marshmallow. Yum YUm YUM!!!
Kathy is the best! She did my french manicure with gel and it came out amazing! I only wish she could have done my toes as well. Someone new did them and based on how they came out, you could tell he was new. Go to Kathy! She is your lady!!
Not exactly a fan of this location, however I tend to frequent it because of my work location, but I always leave unsatisfied.  The baristas are not friendly.  I'm always always always made to feel like I'm stupid (seriously?  i'm ordering coffee from you - who gave you a Masters Degree of all things brewed?)  and they're just rude.  Just.... rude.  I've never had an issue with my order being accurate, although again, just ordering coffee people.  I'm not asking you to recite the Gettysburg address.. in Latin.. backwards.  Just asking for a coffee.. congrats on getting it right!  I wwill also add that everytime I go in to this store, it smells.. bad.  real bad.  not like the delicious aroma of fresh brewed coffee.  No no.  You know those febreze commercials where they take the most disgusting atmosphere for smell and throw poor, unsuspecting victims in there to test the febreze-ee-ness of the area?  Yeah, it's like that.  Only with no febreze.  

To sum it up, I would suggest if you're in the area and need some starbucks in your life, take a few extra steps and go to the one on the corner of 6th and penn.  Those people are SUPER friendly (gave me a free coffee on new years day because I was on my way to work and realized I forgot my credit card after I ordered for me and my coworkers.. so nice!) and it smells like a coffee shop should smell - like coffee.  WHOA.. mind. blown.
If you're looking for a cute-sy place to try at a great location on the Strip (in front of Caesar's Palace) this place should make your list. Yes it's expensive and probably overpriced but what place on the Strip isn't? The wait is pretty crazy but, I did get a kick ass table outside on the patio with an amazing view and great service! The frozen hot chocolate was amazing, lets be honest, but I couldn't come close to finishing it because the drink is so huge! My friend and I had a fun time chatting, enjoying our beverage\/dessert and being on the strip. I would come back for sure!!
I know. You are reading this and wanting to ridicule me for giving a high rating to a big box chain fast food joint. But before you judge I want you to think about having late meetings, or a busy night where you're at work, then the gym, then off to meet friends. Before you know it, it's late and you haven't had some food. Jack in the Box is the cure to this. Bonus is they don't have a specific time for breakfast or lunch... they offer curly fries and they have plenty of offerings that I don't have to specify no tomato on. This isn't by any means my favorite place, but at 3am, it's a great option.
i LOVE sharp edge creekhouse!  we are there almost every friday after work, and we've never been let down.  We've had 1 or 2 minor things go wrong with an order, but it's not even worth mentioning because it's always immediately taken care of above and beyond expectation.  The food is I would say, just average, but we love going there because they have a great beer selection and we always feel so welcome and taken care of when we show up.  The staff is so friendly, and so knowledgable.. these people know their beer!  Their late night menu is decent.  They have a bunch of half price appetizers, and have a limited selection of full price items as well (it's basically the entire menu excluding soups and salads).  The prices are good and we always leave satisfied :)
Great stone oven pizza. delicious tomato sauce, perfect mozz cheese, we added proscuitto ontop which just made it that much better.  Small personal pies, but worth the price.  Best Pizza ive had in the burgh so far.
This place is so freaking cool. I thought it was an ordinary convenience gas station drive through. When I walked in it was extremely clean, employees were extremely friendly, and they even have a walk in beer fridge with so many beers. Oh! And they have a deli type counter to make sandwiches! Just so cool. They're also open 24 hours which is amazing!
The happy hour pepperoni pizza didn't blow me away.  It was a little too small and a little too oily, and I didn't care much for their crust.  Maybe my expectations were just too high?  Or is the happy hour reduced price pizza "lesser" than the full price one?

Service was quite good for our very large group.  Not having to valet at the time we arrived was a relief.

I'd be willing to give them another try if someone wanted to go here though.  Personally, though, I'll be sticking to Federal (drive-through pickup!)...or Bianco (on Camelback) or North (ugh, parking) if I am feeling fancy.
I've been taking my car to Tuffy's for several years.  It's always a great experience.
Good place, dark, tons of TVs and great food, I like to sit in the restaurant area because it has more to view, and the bar area seems to be full of D-Bags but that's just me. But since it is close to home it's always up there on places to go when you want a quick drink or some bar food.
This is a great BBQ place to eat. It's one of those unique - reasonably priced places to take guests.
We did not purchase our piano from Stilwell but we did hire them to tune our upright. We were very impressed with their services -- the technician was prompt, efficient, and gave his input on small repairs we could eventually consider for our piano. Also reasonably priced for tuning\/upkeep. I am sure we will be calling them again for regular maintenance.
After so much hype from my aunt and cousin about Payard in NY, I eventually made a trip out there years ago (probably close to 8 years ago).  Wasn't impressed with either the food nor the dessert, and was skeptical when a good friend mentioned that Wolfgang Puck said that Payard had the best macaroons.

Located inside the Caesar's hotel (not the Forum Shops) you'll see this little bistro with a cool looking clock (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw?select=HK3bDDmzc9XWsm7OY_05Og).  Still feeling the sugar high and saving room for the nights dinner, I only purchased a box of macaroons.  Best part of it was that it was the last box ... atleast that's what they said (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw?select=nOAbwLCOW974lJNWY2gNFg).  What sucks is that you don't get to choose the flavors, everything is preboxed to go.  Not exactly sure as to how fresh these little bad boys were but the texture and flavors were similar to what you'd find at Paulette.  I'd have to say that I think Paulette's were a bit better in my mind.  Perhaps it's the fact that we didn't get to pick and choose the flavors or the fact that one of them was damaged in the box.  It did however, come with a pretty cool little box.
I celebrated my birthday at this Oreganos last night and the service was Amazing. My party of 13 turned into 30 due to some last minute out of town guests. The manager Jordan took immediate action to find us a section so we didn't have a two hour wait. He came back to check on us serval times to make sure we were okay. Our server Valerie then came outside to introduce herself while we waited, ensuring us with enthusiasm she could handle such a large party with ease...and she did! The entire wait was less than an hour we got our food and drinks promptly with no mistakes. My usual Oreganos is the Gilbert location but I'll now be switching to the Power location.... but not with 30 guest . 
Thanks again guys!
Went to Heist on Mother's Day. Our reservation made Monday was no where to be found Sunday. They found seating for us in a pretty short time considering it was Mother's Day. I was a bit disappointed that the only thing they offered at 1:00 in the afternoon was the brunch buffet. I personally decided to wait till 2:00 to order from the lunch menu. I order the pretzels and beer cheese. It was excellent. I ordered the Lamb meatballs and really enjoyed them. My guest had the brunch and were very happy with there choice. The others waited with me and ordered the flat breads. They enjoyed them. Service was up to expectations considering the crowd. I will return to try the dinner menu.
Thought I'd try something new for AYCE sushi. I usually get simple rolls. Liked it but didn't feel it was quite as fresh as other Henderson spots. Nigiri yellowtail w jalapeño. Tuna. Seared tuna. YelloW mango roll. Salmon loves lemon roll. I'd come again but wouldn't likely go out of my way. Didn't love the seaweed salad. Movie screen w music videos and sports games above.
I stopped into Daphne Cafe early this winter for a falafel wrap. I thought the falafel itself was pretty right on - nice crispy exterior with warm soft center and decent flavor. But the wrap was a white tortilla from Sysco (the tortillas were in the display case behind the counter, that's how I know! Tacky!) which I thought was gross and weird. I mean even Sysco sells pita, which would have been a slight improvement. My next pet peeve about this falafel is that there were no cucumbers on it. My next pet peeve is that there were pale-totally-unripe-flavorless tomatoes on it. Sorry, I just hate pale tomatoes; if they are not in season or ripe, please spare me. The lettuce was iceberg, not the biggest deal. It had tahini on it, so that was right. 

I don't think I will go back to see if they use higher quality ingredients in other menu items.
I found out about this place watching diners, drive ins, and dives and when I moved out here my wife and I had to try it. We got the Fontina Cheese Burger which was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. The pesto chicken sandwich was delicious if you love pesto. The onion rings were the best I've ever had. You must go if you live in the area. You won't be disappointed.
Wholefoods is a great store if you are a health conscious person that doesn't mind paying higher prices for your grocery items. There are locations all over the country. The locations that I shop at are on W Charleston and the other location is at Town Square. The town Square location is a larger store.

Wholefoods has fresh organic vegetables and fruit. There is also a great selection of fresh seafood and meat. They also have grass fed beef and dry aged steaks. There is a bakery, pizza & sandwich counter, and much more.

There is also a huge food bar and deli counter. The food bar is $2 off per pound on Wednesday at the W Charleston location. There are sushi rolls made with brown and whole grain rice. They have everything you could want to live a healthy life style at WF's.
Un 340e avis pour le Jardin Nelson! Un incontournable de l'été à Montréal. Leur terrasse est magnifique. Tous les soirs, un band y joue du Jazz. On entends les chants des petits oiseaux tout autour. 

Leur menu est très variées comparativement à certaines années où le menu était écrit sur le  napperon en papier. 

Les plats y sont très bon. J'ai goûté leur tartare et leur ceviche. Délicieux les deux. Par contre le ceviche est un peu trop citroné et le goût des poivrons y prends le dessus. 

Ils ont des cocktails, bières et sangria. Leur pichet de sangria est environs de 30$. Je ne vous recommande pas l'endroit pour aller Boire seulement..!
I had been hearing about Gangplank for as long as I can remember. My first encounter was towards the beginning of this year when I swung by for a peak during an event. I absolutely fell in love with the space and the concept. Since then, I have been holding my IxDA Phoenix events there and heading to Gangplank for other meetings and events. They have been so helpful by not only allowing me to hold IxDA Phoenix there, but also asking me if I'd like a permanent spot on their calendar. 

It's a perfect spot to foster collaboration, ideas, and discussion. There are white boards, tons of tables and chairs, wifi and so much more. People are always there to bounce ideas off of, and you can't help but be inspired when you sit down and get ready to accomplish a goal.

Most recently I was there for the ReOpen Phoenix event last night. I love music and get a kick out of seeing the results of collaboration of different styles and genres so I thought I would sit in for a bit and have a listen. I ended up staying there until the very end. The music was fantastic, it was great to meet new people, and I ended up being able to get some work done all at the same time. This definitely needs to happen more often.

Truly a great place to spend a few hours at if you need to get something accomplished! Great things happen here!
We had a great time at MacDonalds Ranch!  

I was looking for something fun and specific to the area to do with my husband and my in-laws while we were in Scottsdale, and while there's plenty of fun things to do, I was somewhat limited because my in-laws aren't quite as adventurous as my husband and I, so when I found this deal on Groupon I immediately contacted the ranch via email to ask some questions.  They replied promptly and were very informative - that was extremely appreciated!  I concern was that many of the reviews were regarding families with kids, or for a different season, so I wanted to make sure this would be fun for 4 adults as well.. if you're wondering the same thing, I'll save you some time and just tell you that it was perfect for us!  I purchased the 90 minute ride for 4 people (less than $150!), there were 2 other adults in our group (there may be up to 10 people) and we had a really good time!  The ride was easy, so it's perfect for beginners.  My mother in law is not comfortable around animals (not something you usually want to find out AFTER the fact, but oh well haha!) and she did great!  Her horse was gentle and they tail-to-nose the entire time, at a slow, easy pace.  Truthfully, if you have a lot of experience riding, this may not be your choice activity, as it is a "perfect for beginners and kids" activity.. so just keep that in mind!  The guides were really friendly and very eager to answer any and all questions we had throughout the entire ride.  There was a guide in the front and a guide in the back, to make sure nobody gets too far behind.  During our ride we saw a coyote which I thought was awesome!  We chose the sunset ride (end of June) so it was really very beautiful and peaceful. Another thing I really appreciated was that after we were all saddled up, they took one of our phones and took a couple pictures of us on our horses, and then took pictures of us riding which were available for purchase ($10 per photo), and we purchased all of them!  It was a really great keepsake that wasn't over priced!  

This was our first time partaking in anything like this, so while I don't have anything to compare it to, I can tell you that I can't imagine how it could get too much better.. and all the locals we spoke to about it agreed that MacDonalds Ranch is a great place to visit!  I highly suggest going - fun for all ages and a great time!
The Hotel Dauphine is on the South shore, across the river from downtown and old town Montreal. But it is next to a Metro station so traveling back and forth is easy to do, and you pay less on this side of the St. Lawrence. 

It is just over the Pont Jacques-Cartier, so driving back and forth is pretty easy, and parking is free, with plenty of it. You can get a nice, clean room, with faux hardwood linoleum floors for about $100 most of the time, and that includes a continental breakfast, too. You also get free WiFi in your room, and actually there is a desktop computer and monitor on the desk, so if you forgot your computer, Voila! 

There is of course a TV, iron, iron board, coffee maker. etc that you would find in most business type hotels. Since it is near education centers, a lot of students stay here and work here, but they are friendly and pretty well trained.  

So if you want to save a little money and just be a couple of Metro stops from downtown Montreal, this is a good choice. Caution: the beds here are super firm!
REALLY ugly interior, really awful food, stuck next to perpetual construction from the light rail, in a sketchy neighborhood.  I only ended up here because everywhere else was closed.

I won't be back.
Initially met Dr. Saba at the hospital when he did the welfare check of our newborn son. Love him, and his bedside manner and sense of humor. Too bad the front office staff as well as the billing woman are miserably rude. I have been to 6 wellness visits with my son so far and each time I had to wait at least 45 minutes to see the doctor. Just last week, I waited 40 minutes in the waiting room and decided enough was enough after having my healthy child sit amongst a revolving door of sick and coughing children with no end in sight or update from the front desk girl. Sad that I have to find another pediatrician, because he wasn't the problem, the overbooking and front end staff was.
The best service I've had in a long time!! I had breakfast at the Peppermill on March 14th, the day after my friend's wedding. We were a group of about 14 people. I was a waitress in my past life and I remember dreading big parties.

Our waitress (wish I remembered her name) was awesome! She was quick, efficient, and offered split checks... she was amazing! The food was good and the service was even better! I will definitely go back to the Peppermill the next time I am in Vegas!!
I am not a fan of Phillip Pelusi hair salons.  I have been to several different locations (Bloomfield, Sq. Hill, South Side, and Robinson) and I always thought the prices, regardless of range, were too high considering the skill and personality of the stylist.  They never call to remind of the appointment either, which I think should be a common courtesy these days.
We were planning a ladies lunch, it was second day of the festival and the sun was shining . So where do ladies that lunch go?

We decided on Wedgewood, so we took advantage of the 12 pounds for two courses, or 3 courses for 16 pounds. The restaurant itself is well laid out and had a lovely buzz about it when we walked in. We'd booked in advance which was a good idea as the restaurant as full soon after we arrived.

We went for a fresh salmon starter which was served with beetroot puree and a deep fried haggis with a wonderfully spicy salsa. The salmon was so fresh I was instantly transported to the beach at North Berwick, and the beetroot puree has a wonderfully earthy taste which wasn't too sweet as beetroot dishes can be sometimes. The haggis was beautifully soft inside with a nice crunchy bite on the outside and the salsa had a really good kick on the finish.

Our mains were just as good and my coley filet was cooked perfectly with the flesh still being firm and flavourful. I have to admit I don't remember which wine we ordered (but it was delicious) as I left my friend to order that as I had to duck out and deal with a parking situation at that point of the meal.

If you're looking for a great value lunch served with a changing menu taking advantage of the fresh seasonal ingredients available, I'd highly recommend Wedgewood.

By all means take advantage of the 3 courses for 16 pounds, but if like us you're too full then I'd highly recommend a wander to let your lunch digest then a trip across the road to Mimi's picnic parlour that does Luca's ice creams!
*Located in the same plaza with Chatime, which is quite smart as the latter doesn't serve dessert (only some donuts) so Chatime buyers can come to Sweet Esc after buying bubble tea, or vice versa. 

*Really small, at best this place can only hold 15 people.  

*Apparently they are still in the soft-opening week so menu might change. 

*Their main dessert is the hotplate for $7.5. First you have to choose your base (brownie or waffle); ice-cream (vanilla or earl-grey); sauce (chocolate or vanilla) and finally the toppings (fruits, brownie bites, crushed nuts etc). The portion is quite generous for the price. 

I ordered the hot-plate with waffle and my friend got the brownie one. 

The iron plate is heated until it is boiling hot, then the chef would put the base and all the toppings on top. All you have to do is to pour the sauce around the base and you will start to see some steam and sizzle! I wished there was more variation of fruits and extra fruit pieces. To be honest, while the effect was "cool," I don't understand the purpose of the iron plate. 

The waffle wasn't that great, it was too dense and chewy for my taste. Likewise the brownie was just like other brownie I have had. If you ask me, I think the iron-plate should be heated longer so then the heat will cook the bases, and give them a slight crust on the outside. The good thing about these desserts was that all the components weren't too sweet, and the bitter dark chocolate helped to balance the sweetness of the dishes.

*Overall: I would visit again once they have finalized their menu. As the owners are still in the menu-testing phase, there are rooms for improvement in terms of the offerings and quality of the dishes. Also, most items were decently priced for the amount and taste of food, it doesn't hurt to try if you are in the area to grab chatime  :p.
Right now I am consuming a combination of raspberry tart, pomegranate, and birthday cake yogurt mixed with coconut, pineapple and walnuts.

Right now I am also in heaven.

I usually get the same thing every time I go, but it's never led me astray and it's really delicious. The flavor of the pomegranate and the texture of the coconut are my overall favorites.

I noticed what seemed to be new flavors today (such as the birthday cake) and some new toppings such as various new fruits and new cereal ones. I think this means that next time I might branch out into birthday cake and cap'n crunch! One thing I'd love to see is marshmallows.

I've never been in there and had slow service. It's help yourself and always seems to go smoothly. The location being hidden on mill kinda sucks as far as driving down there and parking, but that's Mill, can't blame them completely for that. Prices are a little expensive too but you do get what you pay for. Delish!
They try and force you to buy a "bottle of water for the plane" vs just giving you a glass of water. When I asked the waitress to take the bottle back, she was clearly annoyed to have not "made a sale."  The music playing is bothersome and the food marginal. Dry leathery steak.  I would avoid this place.  Yuck.
Went there looking for a used receptionist desk and ended up leaving feeling like we were bothering the salesperson.  When we walked in the place seemed nice and had lots of options.  We browsed the new area and saw there was a back warehouse with a sign that said "come in" so we walked through the used area and saw some possible options we could purchase.  Pricing seemed fair for the used furniture and we saw a few pieces of interest.  When the sales person came out and asked us if we needed help she seemed very annoyed that we were there.  She made it feel like we were bothering her and she didn't have time for us.  When we inquired about different options and what they had in stock (the sign on several items said more in stock) she said those are old signs and she doesn't know what they have.  When we asked her to check she just seemed more annoyed and acted like she had better stuff to do.  We saw a nice desk but I don't do business with people who act like they don't need it or want it so off to the next place.
I've had lunch here a number of times and dinner twice. All times were above adequate.  
Sadly the parking on a Tuesday afternoon was rather challenging. It took me twenty minutes at the machine. Three cars ahead of me. I should've known, piling on took ten minutes. Luckily the attendant was on hand and she was helpful. Bonus, she remembered assisting me when I came in. The bar wouldn't go up and she even had issues with it releasing up so I could proceed into the garage. Yes, my plate was correctly on the parking meter ticket. Leaving it told me invalid ticket. That was after waiting twenty minutes on the line so I could leave. 
Now, onto lunch (once I finally left the parking garage situation).
Met some friends yesterday afternoon who were staying at Aria. It was about 12:30 on a Tuesday- not at all busy. Our waitress was far from that. My friend's husband inquired about the soup, and she spoke AT him and then as if he had no idea about soup or food. If personalities were sold, I would purchase one for her. She never returned inquiring if we needed anything additional. When she brought our drinks she basically threw them down. We thought about dessert, espresso what have you. Then we thought about our waitress. Thought it was better in just leaving sooner than later. The pizza wasn't fully cooked, underneath was more on the raw dough end and no brown on the bottom.  It had a nice taste, mushrooms and sausage. Who can honestly not have made a pizza correctly. They did- not cooking it fully.
Je tiens à m'excuser d'avance de ne pas avoir pris de photo...j'avais oublié mon téléphone sur mon bureau bref..passons à la critique..

Dîner de groupe entre collègues. Nous étions environs 25. Oui 25 c'est vraiment beaucoup...mais quand le restaurant n'a que 8 autres clients....Ils ont un menu très variées le midi, incluant soupe et café. La plupart des plats viennent avec salade et frites ou riz.

Quand je suis arrivé il y avait une dizaine de personne qui étaient déjà assi à notre table. Nous sommes arrivés (nous etions 5) et ensuite deux autres groupes de 5 qui sont arrivée, environs 5-10 minutes plus tard..Imaginez-vous que le serveur a été voir ceux qui sont arrivé après nous. Ils ont même eu leur soupe avant de venir de voir, et les gens qui étaient déjà la se fesait servir le repas principal. Je comprends ils sont arrivés avant, mais au moins nous dire que ce ne sera pas long ou qu'il s'en vient...mais non..

Le serveur est finalement arrivé, nous et un autre collegue avons commandé une bière. Nous l'avons reçu après la soupe en entrée. Un oeu long pour une simple bière, nous avons même du lui repéter. J'ai commandé un wrap au poulet avec du riz mexicain, j'ai bien aimé. Par contre, il fallait fouillé dans la salade pour trouver la vinaigrette. Le service de nourriture à quand même été rapide. Faut préciser qu'il y a comme 5 bussboy qui aide le serveur...

Les autres collègues on reçu leur café et les gens avec qui j'étais assis,  nous avons encore été oublié. On a attendu 10 min pour recevoir la facture, sans qu'il vienne nous voir. Une madame a même été payé au bar, car elle était tanné d'attendre. Je le voulais ce café, car manger du mexicain ça bourre!!! Mais non pas de café....la facture est arrivé. Un de mes collègues m'a dit: "ils nous ont même pas offert de café... "

Le serveur a entendue et me dit: "Vous aviez d'l'air pressée" Je me suis permis de lui dire...Quand nous attendons 10 min pour une facture, oui on est pressé car notre pause est terminé...

Bref, un 3 amigos à éviter.
A nice little spot to grab a beer and pet a bullie. They have a limited number of beer and wine that you can take home. The seating is limited but cozy.
This is an interesting place. The inside is open and very utilitarian. There are not a lot of frills. The service is good and the prices are fair too. I enjoyed my meal, but I could not eat hear to often without gaining a crazy amount of weight. Everything is tasty, but not great for you.

I ordered the Mexican Crepe. I can assure you this is not what the French have in mind for crepes. That being said it was good and very filling. The crepe is filled with homemade chorizo, onions, green chilies and cheddar jack cheese. It is served with their Habla Diablo potatoes and toast. The flavors combined for a very good overall product. The potatoes were pretty good too.

This is a great place for breakfast food. Which as we all know is great for any meal.
You know what, for what it is, it was pretty good. Recognize that it's a fast food Mexican restaurant, but compare to a Taco Bell, this is gold! 
We went because we had a coupon for free nachos and salsa. We ordered burritos with pulled pork. They were pretty alright, although the salsa really added to them. 
Basically, for the price, I think it was alright. Considering we ate at Mexican restaurants on this trip that were three times the price but no better, I would say, for a quick meal, go for it!
I've been to this place three times now and I'm really happy I found this store.
Let me tell you this, the only con is the neighborhood...it is BAD, so if you're a girl and going there by yourself at night just don't. 

Ok, back to the store. My husband came here to buy my very first vape, so he bought a simple yet cute decent vape, a Sub vod. They gave him a deal as he needed juice and even gave him a skull tip (which I absolutely love). We made it back on that same night to see more different flavor juices and I was amazed to see how attentive and nice they were being.

When I had a question regarding my juices, I called them on a different day and they were very helpful on the phone, explaining me all bout different quantities of nicotine on the juices (I was concerned that one of mine had nicotine when I don't want any).

So, my vape started leaking and we went back there a few days later to ask them what to do, this time I saw a lady and the same guy that sold us the vape. They were very understanding and right away substitute my coil that was burnt. To be on the safe side, because we live really far away, we decided to look for a second vape as I really enjoy vaping now and they gave us a really good deal on a Plato, the pink one I fell in love with since the first time I've been there! Also, I got one more skull tip on an appropriate sice for my new device.

I must say I'm thrilled and happy now I have my "pen" and a squared small one I can fit in any pocket\/purse! Both in colors I like. 

So I've read some reviews talking about bad costumer service and how they won't back you if you have a problem, keep in mind they're older reviews. So they obviously worked on their costumer service and are just amazing!

I'm a loyal client now! Going back for more juice for sure!
Come on ladies, you know finding a hair stylist you like and enjoy talking to is hard to find. Plus, sometimes when you are in an open salon, you feel like everyone is hearing your business and even though you'd like to dish, you don't for the lack of privacy. 

One of the bonuses about going to Stephanie is that she has her own private space and chair. It's not so small that you feel cramped or uncomfortable. It's spacious enough and decorated in such a way that you feel immediately comfortable. 

Plus, Stephanie is a great listener. It doesn't matter whether you are talking about what you want done to your hair or you want to talk about what's going on with your life, she listens- when it comes to your hair, you leave with a great hair cut- when it comes to your life, after talking to her, you feel better. 

Everyone wants a great hair stylist who is also a great listener and that's Stepahnie. And the third important factor is that she has her own private space so whatever is shared is between you, her and the walls!

Stepahnie is my hair stylist of choice!!!!
We showed up to this store yesterday (a Saturday) just after 2 pm. We had purchased a Zephyr ventilation hood here a couple of years ago and needed to order a new filter. We stood at the front of the store for over 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging that we were there. I finally flagged down a salesman and asked if there was anyone who could help us. He told us that he thought that everyone was busy, but that he would check. After 15 minutes, he had not returned, and no one else had spoken one word to us. We left and took our business elsewhere. Horrible experience.
Was in town for company training and a coworker recommended this place.  I highly recommend making reservations as with any izakaya it gets busy.  Arrived only to be disappointed that they didn't have suzume.  Ordered a bottle of something else which wasn't as good.  On to the food, we ordered a bunch of stuff along with the typical yakitori stuff.  The food was good but nothing really wow'ed me.  It may have been the fact that I just simply wasn't hungry.  We did make the mistake of having a few drinks and appetizers at a restaurant inside the MGM.  We definitely ordered too much food as we had leftovers.  Did however try their honey toast which again was good but nothing spectacular.

Will have to go back to try again.
I like Sammy's. I like the food. I like the service. We were seated quickly and out order was taken as soon as we were ready. We did wait for a bit for our food. That was fine. Here's the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5: please don't put suggested tip amounts on my check. I'm an intelligent adult whose smart phone has a calculator. I can figure out the gratuity on my own, and in fact, if it's warranted. In this case our server, Brianna, was lovely. Corporate, take the suggestion and take that crap off the bill, it's insulting.
This is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. The Golden Bite has ruined fish and chips for me forever. Because I will never - EVER - find a fish supper superior, or perhaps even equal, to the one I had this weekend from the Golden Bite.

I travelled to Portobello with Moray L on the express mission of trying the legendary Bite Of Gold after reading Justin G's review, and we were the first ones in when the doors opened at 16:45. The man who greeted us over the counter could not have been happier if he had been a dog in a field full of squirrels. It doesn't seem an exaggeration to say that I suspect frying fish has been his lifelong passion.

Because we were so early, we got the first haddock to go into the fryer - clean, white haddock of gobsmacking, Jonah-swallowing proportions which the chap wobbled at us playfully before setting about the battering and frying.

At this point - minutes after the doors opened - the shop filled. I mean it properly filled. I know not how many of these were pilgrims like us, and how many were locals, but it's clear that the reputation of The Golden Bite's fish suppers is widely renowned. I was reaching five stars simply from the cleanliness, the rich frying smell, and the chap's jollity before I'd even put anything in my mouth, and when a small girl entered and he pulled down a teddy bear to wave at her, I was smitten with the place entirely. But the food. The food. The proof of the poisson is in the eating.

Oh. My. Wrapped lovingly in paper and carried down reverently to the seafront for consumption, these piscine Midas fillets were battered to crispy perfection, but still with the softer underside that makes a fish supper truly sensational. The chips - proper chip shop chips - were glorious and plentiful, but not so numerous as to prevent one from finishing the lustrous, luscious fishywishy that so enchanted both me and Moray. I need to go back. No, you don't understand. I NEED to go back. Now. And I don't think I will ever love a fish supper in quite the same way that I love the Golden Bite's.
This hotel is embarrassing cause it is attached to a well known name. I only gave it a shot cause I watched undercover boss and believed the genuineness. In Vegas most casinos have servers that are partially dressed so hooters I thought would do it respectfully after watching the show. I was right, the women are less reveling then most casinos but that was it. This is a serious budget hotel. If you have stayed anywhere else on the strip you will hate your life while here. If you usually stay at the local drug infested motel you will love it. Hooters hotel and casino has not been updated in at least 15-20 years. The a\/c is loud and old the tvs have outlived their life span the bathrooms are old. I have something I'm going to see a doctor about today on the bottom of my foot from walking on the carpets and floor barefoot. Obviously, the beds are old as well as the linens. I can keep going but in two words it sucks. I was embarrassed to stay there. None the less, I bought more than one room and brought guests who I can't stop apologizing to. This guy on tv talks about how his father started this company and how amazing his father was. If all that's true, that father would role over in his grave if he knew the disgrace his son let people stay in now. For a few more dollars you can stay somewhere else and really not be taken advantage of.
Supposément les meilleures cotelettes de porc sel et poivre de Montréal.  Boff...je n'ai pas été surprise du plat. Par contre le riz avec un oeuf frit  était  super bon. J'ai aimé  les rouleaux impériaux. Sérieusement, en lisant les commentaires de yelp, j'etais persuadé  à quelque chose d'extraordinaire.  Un resto digne du chinatown, là où  les tables  sont recouvertes de plastique et les toilettes servent aussi à entreproser des trucs du resto.
Continuing in the week of lunch, I ventured out the other day to Stingray. A coworker and I were craving some sushi, and they love Stingray, so I decided to give it a whirl. I was well warned of the teasing that could easily be done to all the fantasy perfect waitresses, so this I was expecting (and somewhat looking forward to).

I have to admit I wasn't all that impressed with the inside, but I did really enjoy the patio area. It was the perfect place to relax and people watch, which was most excellent that day in particular. The place settings were appreciated, as a lot of places do not offer a stone or cradle to rest your sticks on.. and hell, even my home set has cradles. I made sure of that. 

Also, while the service was good... I think everyone set my expectations pretty high for the waitresses... I was unable to do any harassing. Sad face.

One suggestion if you go... try the green tea. Two reasons. First,  the cups are incredible. I love them. I am considering it a collect them all game and will try to make damn sure I do. Second, the tea is delicious. I had two amazing cups.

The sushi isn't all that bad either. It could've been just me, but I found the selection of sushi a little limited and the specialty ones pretty overpriced, but the sushi I had was out of this world. I had the spicy scallop and the summertime soy paper roll. I seriously gobbled down that summertime roll fast and impressed many. 

I'll probably be back if I crave sushi at lunchtime again. However, I really get disappointed at the prices of the ones I would like to try (especially for lunch) and think I may run out of new dishes to try soon.
Abridged: 
I'm gonna be real with you. I am not in love with Pizzeria Bianco, and had I actually had to wait in line, this rating would probably be lower. My group was lucky enough to receive the last table without any wait.

Maybe it was the fact that it's hard to impress me with pizza. Maybe it was a fluke that won't happen again. At least that's what everyone keeps telling me. But honestly, I just wasn't that impressed with the $19 pizza I received. Sadly, the leftovers I took home ended up being tossed because I was afraid to try it again. 

I've been worried about writing this for awhile (it's been sitting here unfinished for nearly a year), but in the end, my opinions haven't changed, and I sit here, still scared to return. If someone dragged me there again, or had a party there or something, I'd probably give it another shot, as I hate to write off any place after a single trip, but I honestly felt just eh about the whole thing. Thankfully none of my visiting out of town guests have cried for me to take them there.
This place is right across the street from my place so I've been here a few times. It shares a building with a Subway sandwich shop so you can get yourself a fairly healthy sandwich and ruin the meal by topping it off with a few donuts. LOL

They do seem to be short staffed every time I've been here there's only one person working in the back by himself. The Subway staff usually holler at him for me to get his attention.

Other than that it's Winchell's my favorite doughnuts. You'd have to really annoy me to make me not like Winchell's.

It's also open 24 hours a day. So when that sweet tooth strikes I don't have far to go.
I've eaten here a half a dozen times and have always had a good experience. 

The service has always been quick and friendly. The place is always clean. The food has always been tasty.

I'm sure I'll be visiting again.
Due, no doubt, to its being the largest working theatre in the whole of the UK, the Playhouse always has an impressive programme. There are a lot of seats to fill, and there are plenty of other venues in Edinburgh playing to the more adventurous, so there's nothing to criticise about the fact that the Playhouse caters to a popular audience. Large-scale touring musicals (usually from London's West End) are the main bill of fare, with big-name musicians and successful TV comedians forming the bulk of the rest.

As you'd expect, it can deal with pretty much any technical requirement. The stage is enormous, and the lighting demands the Playhouse accommodated for the Joe Bonamassa concert last month were pretty jaw-dropping. I think it might have been the most complex rig I've ever seen.

The first time I came here (to see "Oliver!" - Samantha Barks was playing Nancy) I was amazed at its apparent application of timelord technology. It looks so weeny from the front, but inside... golly. It just goes on and on. I don't just mean the capacity, but the fact is that the seats in the balcony aren't as steeply raked as many other theatres so the rows are more widely spaced; there was sufficient leg-room even for a giantess of my lengthy proportions. Joy! That does mean, however, that the back row is really quite far back, but the sightlines from just about anywhere in the main auditorium are pretty faultless (even in "restricted view" seats).

The only part that seems rather cramped is the foyer; there isn't much room for milling about pre-show. However, the front-of-house staff are all pretty perky; it's a marked contrast with theatres in London, which are peopled for the most part by out-of-work actors and generally have an air of wistful despondence as a result.

One parting fact: I read recently that this was originally, when built in 1929, a cinema. A CINEMA. Oh, how I wish that cinemas these days had vaulted ceilings, gilded boxes, noble-featured statues and comfortable velvet seats. And Ambassador (Theatre Group), with zis four-month residency of ze Lion King you are spoiling us.
Even Montreal, that city of the great white north known for its French styled bistros, has its representation into a trend getting traction south of the border, that is, 

Puzzle Food. 

Puzzle Food is where you walk into a casual place that is pick and choose items from a list of 3 or 4 variables, and put the pieces together however you want to make them fit to make your Puzzle meal. 

Except this place has been around perhaps 10 - 12 years, so maybe Puzzle food started here? 

It is a Puzzling question. 

This place is sort of like Mongolian Barbecue meets Pan-Asian noodle house. 

The Puzzle pieces are:

1. Pick the noodle you want (a variety of Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese and other noodle favorites)
2. Pick your protein (chicken, beef, tofu, etc. )
3. Pick the sauce you want (again, sweet, sweet and sour, spicy, soy sauce, etc. )
4. Pick the veggies from the veggie bar that you want added to your noodles. 

Then wait for the cook to grill it all up, and the waitress to bring you it to your table with the beverage of your choice. Not that Puzzling really. 

This is cheap stuff. $9.99 and $12.99 covers most any combo you want. So it is cheap enough that you don't have to Puzz around (oops did I mean don't be a Putz?) and just come in and order something. But not on a first date. 

If you don't like your Japanese Udon noodles with the American broccoli and cauliflower you chose in the spicy Thai sauce you selected, who's fault is that? 

Why do you look Puzzled with this question?

You Puzz!
I hovered between 2 and 3 stars and finally settled on 2 stars cause well, no one likes to feel ignored and brushed off!!!
It was the grand opening party for Union Barrelhouse and the place was hopping!!!  A fantastic sign for any opening of a restaurant!!!  My son and I were greeted warmly at the door and being Yelpers, were presented with a gift bag at the door (thanks!)  then we sampled their grilled chicken with mozzarella, tomato, basil sandwich which was delish.  We got there at 7pm, they must have had an opening for VIP guests cause even though the event invite said 7pm till close, when we got there a little before 7pm, 95% of the complimentary sampling were gone.  
NO BIG DEAL- we werent' there just for the free food, we came to support this restaurant (must be the same owner as Salty Senorita) so after we greeted fellow Yelpers Irene V., Laura I, Travis B., and the gang, my son and I looked for a patio table cause we wanted to sit down and have dinner. 
Zzzzzz as in the place was buzzing but our waitress was not to be found.  Finally I accosted one and she told me she would be right with me . . . 15 mins later . . . no big deal- there was soccer on tv so we watched the game . . . when she came, we ordered our food- kid's meal chicken tenders with fruit and a farm market salad . . . easy pizy order.
Then we waited and waited- my son who was very hungry kept asking where the food was . . . I accosted my waitress and asked- she said it would be right up.
(As in, palm in face- don't talk to me, can't you see I'm busy??)  I was understanding- I mean, the place was packed!!!
We waited sooooo long that in between waiting my son had time to enter a grilled cheese eating contest where he had 5 minutes to eat 9 grilled cheese sandwiches (which by the way, was very fun)- I don't know how long the contest took- 30 mins?  
By the time we got back to our table, our food was still not ready!!!  10 mins later the food comes, the waitress hurriedly throws the food down on the table and just runs away . . . I didn't even get the chance to tell her she gave my son tater tots instead of the fresh fruit side he ordered.  Finally I had to chase her down and accost her again and she said, "oops, I'll bring it right out . . . "
30 mins later we were still waiting!!!  My son kept asking where his fresh fruit was.
Finally I chased her down and accosted her AGAIN and this time I asked her to talk to the manager to comp'd our meal for the evening.
This is the first time ever in my prolific string of dining experiences where I had to consistently chase down the server- I might have logged a 1\/4 of a mile chasing her down!!!  You get the picture.
The manager came and was very friendly and apologetic and willingly comp'd our meal.  
In terms of pricing, it was $10 for my salad which was medium sized portion, fresh, loved the balsamic vinegarette reduction but I thought it was a bit pricey for the portion and atmosphere of the place.  The chicken tender kid's meal pretty ordinary- nothing to write home about.
Atmosphere is great, food ordered okay, service received epic fail.  Manager very understanding and friendly.  Not sure I would come back again.
Whoever doesn't like this place is a hater ! I love everything about suzuya. It makes me feel as if I am back in Japan. Their cakes\/crepes are not too sweet, not too oily and full of flavors. A bit expensive but I think it's worth it.
I've hiked this canyon a couple of times. The scenery is really amazing. Reading the previous reviewers hike I had to laugh as for sometime I called this area Candycane Canyon before I learned what its real name was.

As mentioned this is a strenuous hike and not for a novice or someone out of shape.
I came ready to buy a car but not a single person approached my husband and I.
4 salesmen saw us and did not say a single thing. 
We thought they were closed ! We even pulled up their hours to verify. 
Horrible service
We went with great anticipation about picking our own vegetables off the vine but it turned out to be a field of weeds and rotting tomatoes. We searched for nearly a half an hour and didn't find a single tomato, pepper, or cucumber that was worthy of picking. We were not allowed to pick corn, cantaloupe, or watermelon. The corn they were selling up front was so small and dried up. The petting zoo and play area was closed.  I'm assuming the fall festival is the best thing here because the farm is in bad condition.
My university days favorite. Generous portioning on every visit, even the smallest portion can fill ya up. They also have some of the best coleslaw in Toronto according to me. Insane lineups for lunch and weekends. Also closes at 7pm so that's a bummer. 

The difference between their medium and large size is pretty mysterious. I'd just go for either a large or small (special) portion. 

Please bring cash, they really appreciate people paying with cash. Otherwise just order on Ritual to avoid talking to them.
I was walking on the treadmill, cooling down after my workout and I went to check in at the gym on Yelp....the first few reviews that came up were all negative and i was shocked that my gym had such a low star rating....So I am now compelled to write a review and really put things in perspective for you if you are thinking twice about joining after reading those bad reviews...

#1. You are at a gym not the Rtiz Spa....So there isn't' someone waiting on your hand and foot every second. If you need something done there are always people at the front desk, trainers in their "area", and the manager's door is always open. All of the employees greet\/acknowledge you verbally, with a smile, or a wave whether they are busy or not. That's pretty great customer service to me...

#2. You are paying for a GYM membership...not a SPA membership...so yes they will charge for extra amenities like tanning, towels, smoothies, kids club, etc. There is no reason that I should pay a huge monthly fee for services that i don't plan on using...so splitting up the cost so that people like me that go to a gym to actually use the GYM aspect of it don't' have to pay for the "extras". That being said, if you want to use other stuff than the GYM then pay up! I have been a member of several gyms--mostly Gold's (going on 3 years now!) but also Sport and Health and Fitness First (those are two fairly large chain gyms but not sure if they are only on the East Coast) and they all have similar policies...you pay for the amenities that you want to use.

#3. I have been a member for this gym specifically for 2 months and I go there 6 times a week. I have never EVER seen an "out of order" sign at any machine. 

#4. The gym is always kept in immaculate condition. I am always seeing one or two people cleaning something every time i go! 

#5. A gym is still a business...if you need to move or just want to stop going you need to give them notice....just like at your apartment or any other place that you pay a monthly subscription fee. That's just the way it is...

#6. Yes the gym gets crowded at peak hours....that's why they are called peak hours...grocery stores also get crowded on the weekend...does that mean that they are horrible places and deserve a lower rating? Not in my opinion.

Anyways....The trainers here are very knowledgeable as they have helped me out in the past with a few things--I've seen them work with a whole range of people from athletes to people who are trying to loose a lot of weight. I've only seen a few of them in action (Robert and Mike) but they are there all the time and so friendly :)
There are 2 major venus for trade shows in Las Vegas. 

1. For huge shows, it is the Las Vegas Convention Center, near the Hilton Hotel. This is where you have 100,000 attendee shows, like the Consumer Electronic (CES) or NAB (National Association of Broadcasters) or the smaller but locally important G2E (Global Gaming Exposition). 

2. Sands Expo and Convention Center. This venue is next to the Venetian and Palazzo hotels on Sands Blvd between the Strip and Paradise road. IT handles the next size shows usually, like an eyeglass show or other mundane industry tradeshow.

Yes, there are other venues in individual hotels for smaller shows, like the Hilton, Paris, Riviera, etc, but most of these just use their larger ballrooms. 

The Sands center is deceptively large. It can accomodate large shows, and probably competes with expo centers like Moscone in SF, or the Anaheim convention center for many large shows. 

Altough it has large square footage for a lot of booths, or even dozens of massive booths of 100 x 100 or more feet, it has some issues. 

First is in\/out access. There is very little sapce to get your equipment in. If you are doing it with your SUV and a pop-up display, there is nowhere close to park. You have to unload on the entry road off Sands Blvd, but you can't leave your vehicle. So drop things off, have someone watch over them, while you drive and park at the Venetian or Palazzo parking lots, and then walk through the casinos to get back to your stuff. It's a pain. At least they don't require you to use union hires for the day to lift every box, while you sit and watch frustratingly like in SF or NY. 

They do have large service areas in the center of the hall, where you have plenty of bathrooms donwstairs, and upstairs plenty of places to eat expensive but poor trade show food. 

The best part about the Sands Expo center is that it is in Las Vegas, so there are plenty of activities and ameneties surrounding you, 24 hours a day.
Came here knowing what we wanted but still our sales guy "dave" really took care of us here! He was super patient and explained everything from payment options, features of cars, and his personal experiences. When the manager wouldn't go any lower on the price of the car, he even wrote us a personal check to make sure we left satisfied. We did and now a month into owning our new car we are so happy and although we also own a Honda...I gotta say that I think we're Hyundai people now ;)
I'm sorry I wasn't impressed at all. I ordered four dishes and all four lacked in flavor, I've been wanting to try this place ever since I heard about it. I drove a good distance just to be disappointed,  sorry will not be going back.
My guest and I had a great evening, from the great cocktail our amazing server Jimmy made us to the good food that followed! A lot had to do with the service, the weather and the vibe...I  recommend!
I think the only thing I appreciate about Whole Foods is entering the store and seeing their fresh cut flowers.  Let's see why.....

I attempt to drive to Whole Foods only to be caught in a line of 5-6 cars attempting to get into the parking lot.  (I guess I'm not cool enough to ride Pat Transit from the South Pittsburgh home).  When I find a place to park, after the Lexus SUV (HA!) pulls out, I find that they didn't put their cart back.  

So I enter the store and admire how their design is very appealing to the eyes (how DO organic oranges get so ROUND and so ORANGE) and everything is stacked so neatly.  Then I read that a pound of these oranges are $1.99...  Then I go to the meat section, which I don't even eat, to find that the prices are double those of Trader Joe's or even Market District (see future review).  So I walk around and debate to see if I should buy Clif Bars and Naked Juice (which happens to be on sale) because LORD KNOWS I don't need bulk-blanched-almonds.  But then I decide to buy "fresh" CHUNKY peanut butter because it would be fun to try.  (When I get home later, however, I bought Valencia peanut butter, whatever the hell that is, and cannot stomach it.  Gimmie my Jif.)  So while I am waiting in line, I see the  bikes (those rebellious urbanites moved from Quiet Storm) and wonder if my money is better spent elsewhere.  

Regardless, I whole-heartedly (no pun intended) support organic and sustainable farming, but I'd rather go to the farmer's market or drive a bit further out of the city to go somewhere real to buy my "whole food".  And at least I put my cart back.
Depuis des années je voulais essayer ce resto au style Diner des années 50. Eh bien, je suis enfin aller! Ça faisait une éternité que ça m'avait pris une éternité choisir dans le menu. Je voulais tout goûter. Mes amis et moi, avons chacun pris une entrée. J'ai donc pu goûter aux entrée de saucisses italiennes, boulettes de viande et le ravioli. Les 3, délicieux, mais prochaine fois, je prendrai les boulettes! Ma soeur et son amie ont pris la salade Pizzaiole. Délicieuse aussi.

La carte de vin est très bien et les prix sont très correct pour un resto. J'ai pris la pizza qui avait des saucisses italiennes. C'est une grosse portion de pizza pour une personne. Mais vous pouvez l'emporter chez vous! 

J'ai adoré le service de la serveuse. Elle était toujours attentive, pas pressé qu'on commande et nous servait le vin. Bref, un endroit à retourner, entre amis, en couple ou même en solitaire!
I'm an East Coaster and don't understand or care for In n Out.  I do however enjoy Fatburger.  I can choose my size and customize- I'm all about that option.  My staple, medium, sautéed onions, mushrooms, Swiss and NO mustard and NO mayo here- ketchup only please!  Their shakes are always undeniably tasty! I go for the lasted limited edition shake;). The staff here is always friendly and all have a smile on their faces and make sure you enjoy what you ordered!  
Please tip them and wait, wait and listen;)
This Sam's Club is hit or miss.  More often than not the cashiers are rude and do not understand English.  Also, they can't seem to stick to implemented policy (ie: taking large items out of the cart or leaving them in the cart). I also loathe being made to feel like a their upon exiting the store.  In no other part of the country do they check your receipts upon exiting the store.  If Costco were closer I would go there.
3 of us came here on halloween night. I personally enjoyed the live music, it was exotic, mellow and not too loud. As soon as we opened the door, we were greeted by this lady who was nicely dressed in traditional thai clothing. Inside was clean and welcoming. I recall we were the only customers there that time, but oh well, it was sunday, this restaurant is located in Henderson and everyone in Vegas must have been busy partying @ the strip that night. 

 When I sat down, I wasn't so hungry, so I was going to only eat papaya salad, but I changed my mind when I look the menu because I found the whole fried red snapper, and I couldn't resist it. (Who can? especially when you're from Asia) Usually, whole fried fish would cost min $50 if you are to order it at those chinese restaurants on the strip, but here, it was reasonably priced and I paid only $20. Ha! The fish was perfectly cooked, inside was steamy and didn't stink at all (it happens sometimes when you don't prepare it well). The meat was firm, and outside was crispy, crunchy, and drenched in spicy tangy sauce. It was not oily though. I ate tails and small bones too... I asked her to prepare it pretty spicy, and they did it just the way I liked it. 

I also ordered Papaya salad which was like $9.00 and it wasn't a disappointment, but I've had something better for this price before. As for duck curry, meat was very tender and surprisingly not too oily. It was kinda sweet because of the pineapples they put in. This one was $13 and it's worth the repeat. 

Next time, I'd like to try couple different soup :)
The fish and chips were way too salty.  
The service was good once they noticed me.  Nice people, but can't go higher than two stars.  Had better fish and chips from frozen aisle of Safeway, frankly.   

By the way dear Management, you must do away with the lock boxes you put the bill and credit card in.  If this is some kind of twisted sobriety test, the humor was lost on me and I know I'm not the only one to be befuddled by this.  

One more thing. A respectable brew pub these days imo should have at least one double IPA or equivalently strong brew on tap.  When I inquired after such, I was informed I was not the first to be disappointed at the lack of this.  

Still and all, great potential in the quaint downtown.  Might try it again when next in town.
Plain and simple, unassuming store front with no seating. Since moving to PA (Moon Twp), I've sampled their meatball grinder (err I mean hoagie) and tonight their pizza. Out-freaking-standing. The guys behind the counter were super friendly, and the food stood up to the test. Great bite to the pepperoni, perfect balance of cheese and a great sauce, and most importantly, a delicious crust that even my kids would eat! Will give other pizza joints in Moon\/Cory a test, but given the crap we've had so far (other than Giani's in Cory), this pie is going to be tough to beat. Well done guys! Definitely coming back.
We've been going here for years, but only about once per year because, though the food is very good and of high quality, it is expensive. We recently ordered 3 entrees, soft drinks and no dessert, and the bill was $85 with tip. But for that price you get a lot of food, great banchan. The bulgogi is some of the best I've tried in town. All the dishes are authentic. The owner made a nice gesture by coming to the table to ask if everything was ok. If you want to splurge a bit for top notch Korean food then Mother's hits the spot.
I don't know... I have mixed feelings about this place. I liked the service - no wait time, clean store, and not so talkative staff. But my gel pedicure ($50) came off after a day. I don't know what to blame. Maybe it's the pool party, or my fragile toe nails, but it was disappointing. I may give this place another chance though.
J Crew, I'm an online customer as J Crew closed the regular retail location at that mall over a year ago.  Now, I'm a customer of the outlet- always merchandised well with a decent turn over of freshly stocked items. Great sales in the back corners on a regular basis (get that punch card when you purchase).  Never have a problem with having a size, because if this location doesn't have that size you 'need' they graciously order it for you for free.  Now the staff here at the J Crew outlet- always perky and personable.  They engage you in a easy, and welcoming way. All move swiftly in showing you what they have or checking the store for a size or color you inquire about. The staff's knowledge of merchandise is above par than most retail stores. Go ahead and make your day and the staff's day and shop here:)
Today was my first time at blue canary, and I had a wonderful experience! I got their unique nitro cold brew, and two vegan\/gluten free donuts from Gluten Free Goat- everything was so tasty and delicious. Additionally, the customer service was fabulous!!! I will definitely be back
I went to the location on Southern and 16th street but didn't see that one listed so I decided to review this location, since it's the same food. I went in on my lunch break one day after a co-worker told me to check it out. I tried calling in advance, since on their flyer they advertise "ready in 15 minutes" if you call ahead and everytime I called, it was busy. I made sure to let them know that when I got there that had happened. They were checking into it before I left.

Staff was friendly. I ordered a catfish sandwich, fried okra and a drink for $9. Food took about 10 minutes to make but it was nice and cool inside the restaurant so I didn't mind waiting. I asked for ranch and tartar sauce on the side. The tartar sauce for some reason is really good and I don't even like tartar sauce! I ate it with my sandwich and fried okra. The okra was pretty good and they give you a lot for $2.99. The catfish on the other hand wasn't my favorite. I keep reading that everyone loves their catfish but there were pieces of mine in my sandwich half cut and that made me feel weird to eat it. I also didn't think it had much flavor and felt the cornmeal breading was similar looking and eating to bird feed. 

They have a lot of choices; everything from fish to burgers so I think next time I will try something else. All in all, it was so-so. I would probably come back.
I'm from Southern Cal. Born and raised in East Los Lived in Sun Diego for 11 years. Cabo Fish Taco are authentic and AWESOME!
Sehr schade - klang toll. Leider nichts, was ich nicht auch Zuhause zubereiten könnte. Lieblose Zubereitung und Essen ist sehr mittelmäßig.
A good lunch, but not worth the hype in my opinion. If you're vegan or a hipster you will LOVE this place. They've got lots of options for those folks. My husband loves it here, I just wasn't altogether impressed. The breakfast sandwich with tomato was good but nothing I couldn't make at home. I'd highly recommend going for lunch around 11-11:30- after that it's a student mad house. But worth a shot!
Thai house 2 has been my go to place for fast inexpensive Thai food. It's less crowded than the one on Spring Mt., both are great and customer service is the only thing that's inconsistent. But overall food is always good. We've tried everything on their menu and all was good.
Have only tried Happy Bellies delivery service once, but so far, so good! Everything worked as planned; I called, I ordered food from a friendly, efficient and knowledgable operator, and the food was delivered to me in about an hour. 

Quality and variety of restaurant offerings rival those of Wheel Deliver.
Delicious food, questionable service. Food took a long time to come out. Servers were slow and unfriendly.
This place is a bit of an adventure...at least for me. I've never had charcuterie before and I'm not generally a big meat eater, so this was a little out of the box. That said, I like trying to be adventurous and trying new things, so when are visiting friends suggested we give it a go, we went for it. Dinner service is open at 6pm, so we agreed we'd arrive at 6pm. We got there at about 6:15....there was already a HUGE wait for a table, but we managed to wrangle seats at the bar. 

The four of us ordered a bunch of dishes to split between ourselves. We tried the charcuterie (sort of a platter of assorted sliced meats and pâté), horse tar tar, roasted bone marrow, pork carnitas tacos, tongue on brioche and the foie gras and nutella for dessert. 

The dishes came out staggered, so we got to sit around chatting and enjoying ourselves and our cocktails. The charcuterie came out first. It was assorted sliced meats arranged on a wood plank and served with bread. It was actually really nice. Next was the horse tar tar. This was a stretch for me. I don't generally like to eat animals that I LIKE. The people I was with convinced me to try a small bit and I must say, it tasted pretty good, but on principle, I just have trouble with it. Sorry! I hate being one of those people who doesn't have a problem killing the "ugly" animals, but doesn't want the cute ones to die...but I am. 

Next was the bone marrow, which was....well let's just say I had to keep telling myself not to think about what I was eating. Basically, it's a big bone and the marrow is of course in the middle and has been cooked so that it's almost the consistency of warm butter...pretty fatty and oily looking. You scoop it out with a spoon and put it on bread. It's actually delicious, but feels like you're eating something you shouldn't, purely for health reasons if nothing else! It feels like eating pure fat....tastes as good I suppose. 

We had the tongue on brioche, which I was only okay with. The tongue was sliced and presented as a sort of Montreal smoked meat. We were told to open it up and eat it like an open faced sandwich. This made it easier to split certainly. The meat itself was very tender and the brioche was great, but the meat had a horseradish (I think) sauce, which was a bit overpowering. 

Finally we had the tacos, which was probably the more "normal" thing we had. I actually thought those were my favorite. Wish it was one of the more exciting things, but nope. Those tacos were excellent. 

The foie gras with nutella was also delicious. It was served on a banana bread, over a nutella spread...but the fois gras was superflous. It didn't add any taste and was overpowered but the nutella and basically didn't add anything to the dish. Could have been served without. Clearly just added to SAY it was there. 

So what's the overall opinion? Well, the restaurant is too small. It's REALLY small, but popular. Wish it was in a bigger location. Sitting at the bar was kind of interesting, because all the cooking was done behind the bar, but that was a small workspace and it got hot, because the oven, dishwasher, stove top and so forth were always turned up very hight. Impressive how they work in such a space though.

Overall the food was very good. SOMEONE knows what they are doing. However, it is quite a pricey place and as I said, sometimes the flavours overpower the meat, or the meat just isn't even necessary. Sometimes you're paying extra for fancy meat dishes that don't even need the meat, or where you can't TASTE the meat. 

Those are the only criticisms, but I wouldn't let that keep you from trying this place...but only if you're willing to go out on a limb a bit and as something different. This isn't a go-to place, but it's a fun place to have gone to! 

Oh...PS - They don't accept credit cards. Only debit or cash.
Sorry but this is not the best Persian food in town. The quality has in fact declined over the years. The bread is not fresh, the hummus is not smooth. Rice is not authentic. For those who don't  know Middle Eastern food this will be a pleasant experience and garner a 4-5 star review, but you won't find many Iranians or Lebanese eating here. Look elsewhere.
Never been here in person, but definitely cannot recommend ordering delivery. We called in our order - phone service was nice enough, she even recommended a smaller pizza to save us money (the menu we were looking at only had one size). After waiting over an hour and a half for it to arrive, we called and were given the excuse that the driver was on his way but having trouble finding us (does he not have a cell phone with which to call us?) and then another one about the roads being bad (there had been a light snowfall and the roads were totally clear, plus we live on a major route not far from the restaurant). My partner who made the call said it sounded like the guy on the phone was talking to the driver in person. Nevertheless, when the pizza finally arrived, it was cold as can be. It was not delivered in a hot-bag, just a fancy new Volvo. By the time we reheated it in our oven, it didn't matter what it tasted like. 

If bullshit is your favorite topping, or you prefer the cold leftover pizza experience, this place is for you!

 FAUT Y ALLEr!
Yum, always good pizza.  Sq Hill and Mt. Lebo locations are both good to stop at.  I know the Mt. Lebanon location sells cuts, I don't remember if Sq. Hill does or not?  I like the plain, but the white is good as well
Oh how I love Jose and his tailor skills!  A friend recommended this place to me when I had to get one of many bridesmaides dresses altered.  It's back in an older strip mall, by Active Body, and upstairs but once you find it you won't go anywhere else.  He's a quiet, sweet man who knows his stuff.....and will get it done quickly.
I never really liked bibimbap, I find it basic, just rice, meat, veggies all mixed together, I can totally make this at home, however the uni bibimbap stood out to me. I ordered it. I loved it. I liked the flavors and how the rice at the bottom was crisp. 

We split the fancy Kobe beef, worth every bite, so juicy and soft. 

Ice-cream Macron was very delicious and great price for the size 

If the service was better I would give them 5 stars. They were just slow to take our order and didn't pay attention to details.
Walgreens is a nice one-stop shop for some small necessities. 

The pharmacy accepts the CVS caremark card so you can get cheaper prescriptions. I got my flu shot for free here with a CVS caremark card, and I was in and out. The wait time felt like awhile despite no other people in line, but the shot itself didn't take long. Paperwork is mostly the reason for the wait. They provide other vaccinations as well, and you can even fill out the form online to save time.

They carry a range of things here similarly to RiteAid and CVS. Things such as small toys, cards, cosmetics, toiletries, snacks, seasonal items, etc. The location is quite ideal, and the building is pretty clean.
Go on the Isle of Skye 3 day tour from Edinburgh and request Chris. I could end the review there and you wouldn't be disappointed, trust me. As a young couple that travels the world and NEVER takes a guided tour, I cannot say enough about how impressed I was with this tour. We had a short amount of time in Scotland and knew the only way to see a lot would be to take a tour. The locations we visited were amazing, and the scenery was breathtaking, but our guide Chris made the tour what it was - he was a wealth of knowledge and was one of the best storytellers I've ever heard. I absolutely recommend this tour and if we go back to Scotland, we'll definitely be looking into another Rabbie's tour.
I've stopped in here several times. It's always busy but they seem to move along at a decent speed.

As with all fast food joints nowadays be sure to check your bag before you go as there's a 50\/50 chance they won't get your order right.

They've got one of those new machines inside where you can place your order. Thanks but no thanks. I'd rather place my order with an old fashioned human being.
Quick and good service. I had dinner here and all plates are delicious. Always gotta lined but worth for waiting.
This dealership is great until the deal is closed and you take your car home.  Trying to get a return phone call from the service department or certain members of management is impossible.  We started out with a good relationship but it quickly deteriorated.  Today was the worst.  We drove about 25 miles ONE WAY to have our car serviced with them (we had made an appointment).  We arrived early and waited.  Approximately 48 minutes past our appointment time, our car was still sitting where we had parked it and no one had even bothered to come inside the showroom waiting area and update us.  There was another customer inside waiting for her car and she had to call someone to tell them that she had no idea it would take so long for servicing her car and she had already been waiting for about 40 minutes. There were staff members shouting and arguing loudly in the showroom, as well as out in the service area.  We felt very uncomfortable with this lack of professionalism.  We took our unserviced car and left.  Our intentions are to get our final oil change done that was part of a package we bought and then we are looking for a dealership closer to home for servicing issues from now on.  We do not plan to purchase any more cars from here, either. We gave the one star rating only because there was no zero rating available!
Lunch review. Will not be coming back for lunch. Calamari salad was good but needed xtra avacodo. Shrimp and Grits was bad. They used small and ugly shrimp and the sausage suck. Chicken sandwich was dry. Tuna gyro was over cooked with no taste and thier crab and pasta salad tasted like garbage. The service was awesome.
Came here for a birthday dinner and this place did NOT disappoint. They have such COOL food here that are not only delicious but also visually delicious!! 

I LOVED LOVED LOVED their chicken wings....I mean really!!! Gourmet wings!!!! They were asian-ish and soooooo goood!!! I almost ALMOST cancelled the rest of our order and just asked for more wings ;)

From our friend who had been here in past months it seems like they have updated their style and menu....and for the better! It is a tapas style restaurant but the serving amounts were decent! I also had a citrus (adult) drink...can't remember the name now...but it was delicious :)

I can't wait to go back!!
This is a very late review, and is written only because I know a couple people who have either 1)spoken well about this place and in fact eat there regularly, or 2)asked my opinion about Dianna's breakfast compared to another, worlds apart in terms of quality, restaurant. 

I've lived in Lakewood for over 2 years now, and in that time, have driven by Dianna's almost daily. I was first notified about the quality of food at this place by the restaurant itself, who had a large banner in front of their place notifying customers that Dianna's now had (this is not a direct quote) "new lower food prices for the same quality food!"
If that is not an endorsement, I don't know what is. 

My one friend who lives near me, frankly has unsophisticated taste. I'm not trying to be mean. That is just a hard fact. I don't attribute this to anything other than maybe a lack of traveling (aka worldliness). But I love my friend--he's a great man and a smart one at that. Maybe it's just naiveté, because he seems to love Dianna's. 

The other friend and I went to Dianna's one time I think the weekend after we dined at Grumpy's for Sunday brunch. I don't know why I agreed to go to Dianna's that day because I already had suspicions about the food there. On that day, prior to dining at Dianna's I had not ever experienced their food. Only heard about it and read that sign in front of the building. I guess I was a little bit tired that day, and in a fit of fatigue, agreed to try it with friend #2. My suspicions were confirmed that morning. This place is bad. DO NOT GO HERE. The quality of the food is significantly less than sub-par. Mushy hash browns, bland coffee.
This place is like donut crack.

Buying donuts for 8 coworkers = a million donuts??

Only at Bosa!

They have so many donuts...so many that it's impossible to choose only a few for your small group of coworkers. So many that we eat until we hit a breakfast sugar coma that can only be topped by Thanksgiving and still have some to give away to coworkers to bring home to their families. 

The staff is so super nice and help guide your overwhelming mind in as little time as possible to speed up aforementioned coma. 

For serious. You can't go wrong here people. Donut crack.
Having lived in Mesa and delivered sub sandwiches to some of the tweekiest of tweakers, I don't feel any shame in admitting that whole area now resides in a dead zone for me. When I get that itch to go out and tear up the town, waste away a lazy afternoon, or enjoy a nice dinner, I think of places north, south and west of Tempe. It's like my brain has one of those little electric dog collar things attached to it, and when I start to stray too far east, it gives me a subliminal zap so I erase Mesa from the map in my mind.

So naturally, Stray Cats is usually a place I visit when meeting up with others who have suggested it. 

Thing is, I always end up having a pretty good time when I go there. The drinks are priced reasonably and generally on the strong side, the bartenders are friendly and quick to serve. The music is pretty good, but I've never been here when a DJ's spinning. I used to like the fact that there was an air conditioned smoking room off to the side with plush couches and big televisions. The crowd is always diverse, friendly and easy to engage in slurred conversation.

It just doesn't have any special oomph for me. I'd much rather frequent Hollywood Alley a couple miles south, where there's pool and live music. Unfortunately it's also on the black list of Mesa, so maybe I should find a way to reverse that programming. It's not just tweakers and mormans, it's not just tweakers and mormons, it's not just tweakers and mormons....
I have been here now several times and they never disappoint. The food is excellent. The also make a great Michulada (don't know if I spelled that correctly). Best damn tacos and street corn EVER!! Go!!
If your looking for authentic food this is the place to go to! It is not super fancy but the people who work here are very warm and friendly! I was brought warm chips and three different types of salsas that were very good! I ordered the bean wet burrito it was amazing!!! It was stuffed with refried beans, rice, cilantro, and onions, topped off with a good Red sauce and cheese and sour cream! I will definitely be back to this place !!!
Went with my friend, who told me she really likes this place and gets their takeout every Friday. Seemed like a safe bet...and it was! 

I'm a little confused by the earlier reviews...well...I'm confused by ONE earlier review. But then again, not really, because some people are...well...the way they are! Whatcha gonna do??

As with traditional Italian restaurants (both in the city AND in Italy), the waiters do not coddle you. 

Anyway, the service was great. We had a very attentive waiter. He asked us where we would prefer to sit and we chose a seat for two, but the window. 

The menu is extensive, with a lot of choice. I was debating between a couple of dishes, so my friend suggested we order two things and share. She ordered a pasta dish and I ordered a pizza. 

While we waited for the main course, we were given a basket and soft bread and oil and vinegar...mmmmmmmm....

Our food came out and both dishes were DELICIOUS! The pasta was great, the sauce was especially good. The pizza had mozzarella and goat cheese and veggies...goat cheese on pizza = perfecto! 

We had leftovers....and then we decided to hell with self control and ate them. 

Needless to say, we were too stuffed for dessert. Shame, because they looked very good.

Turns out that this is not the first time I have had food from here. The same friend, used these guys to cater a party she had. She had some large trays of pasta and I remember really enjoying them...you know, as far as catered food goes (to please everyone, they had gotten pastas on the plainer side). 

I think this is a good, solid place. Prices are what you would expect for the food and area.

Why missing one star? I've still had better Italian in the city....I'm picky enough that I need to be REALLY blown away to award 5 stars. 

That doesn't mean this isn't a good place, worth checking out though!
Many people don't realize there is a campground within the McDowell Mtn Regional Park easily accessible from Phoenix and within the Fountain Hills city limits. Even my friends who camp often when I told them I was taking my son camping here, they give me a blank stare. 
A hidden secret of fully supported tent and RV facility including super clean restrooms and showers right next to a playground, this is a perfect place to have a family jamboree or tent up to hike or mountain bike around the many trails that are right next to the campground. 
The only downside is there are no shade or large trees on any of the tent sites so bring an EZ pop up to provide some shading or go camping in the fall months when weather is perfect here in Phoenix.
We were eating here so we could easily get into the club.  It turns out the food is actually pretty good.  They sat us just a few minutes late.  We found a nice spot by the bar to have a few pre dinner drinks.  The drinks are pricey but the setting is great.

We started with the chicken satay and pork rolls.  Both were excellent.  The peanut sauce with the satay was great.  For my meal I had the filet with noodles.  The sauce was great.  I would have liked a little more meat, but I was still very happy with my meal.

For desert we shared the giant fortune cookie.  One half was filled with dark chocolate mouse.  The other half was filled white chocolate mouse.

Overall it was a very good meal.
I've been having mad cravings for a really good hot fudge sundae... We were driving down Lancaster and I that saw Rita's had frozen custard. I decided to give them a try. I walked into the small shop and was greeted by a young employee. She pointed out the list of Italian ice flavors posted on the wall. I asked how the custard was and she said it was "really good." I ordered a kid's hot fudge sundae... I was handed a small cup filled about half way with a pretty sad looking drizzle of hot fudge on top... Here was the shocker... I paid $4.70 for a kid's hot fudge sundae... For real?? The "custard" was ok... it really wasn't custard at all but a thick soft serve (traditional frozen custard is scooped, not swirled out of a machine!). The hot fudge was just the cheap canned stuff... Needless to say, I'll be continuing my search for the best hot fudge sundae in Charlotte.
We ended up here because MoRoCo had rented out their entire restaurant for a party and we wanted a decadent dessert. We went in and looked at the selection and decided what we wanted and when the person behind the counter asked to take our order and we said we wanted to sit down. He wouldn't take the order and instead had us sit down and look at menus. We explained we knew what we wanted already, but he said he'd be back in a minute. This was fine, we weren't in a rush, but we were both a little confused by the ten minutes we sat there waiting for him. 
When he finally came out, as we were ordering, his cell phone rang and he took the call and walked away, around the corner of the building. We waited for about five minutes for him to finish his call and he finally took our order. Umm...that was some pretty shocking un-professionalism, but we laughed it off and ordered. 

I ordered basic New York cheesecake and my friend ordered an apple cheesecake. Cheesecakes were good, (she really liked her) and we ordered cappuccino and a flavored San Pellegrino and they were good and big sizes, but my cheesecake was a bit frozen in the middle. Knowing it wasn't fresh sort of took away from the experience. 
Anyway, we had a fine time here and the desserts are good, but not great. It was the service that was most disappointing. 

Will I go back?? Yes, if MoRoCo is closed again!
I went here last night for dinner with two other friends. We decided to try it out after hearing that there would be a wait for the patio at the Rebel House. They have a lovely patio at Doria  and a bright seating area inside with large, wide windows open to give the feeling as though you are sitting on their patio. 

The menu is fairly limited, generally featuring salads and pizzas with a few paninis. I got the funghi salad (mushrooms, parmesean, arugula, brown butter vinaigrette), which I believe was $12 (or it might have been $11). I asked to substitute tomatoes for the parmesean and for the vinaigrette to be switched to a balsamic and served on the side. The waitress assured me this would be possible and even checked with the chef first before confirming with me. When the salad arrived, there wasn't any parmesean, which was great, but there also weren't any tomatoes. In addition, the salad was covered with breadcrumbs (not listed on the menu), and the salad was oily, despite the fact that I asked for dressing on the side. Needless to say I was disappointed with my meal. 

Our server was pleasant, although she seemed rather young and wasn't particularly attentive. I liked that the kitchen was directly in the restaurant, and it was clear that everything was made to order.

I would return and would likely try a different dish.
If you like salty food--this is the place to go!! 
I love that they have a VISION and they stick to it from the food to the decor! The BF had to order two burgers to feel full and I would have too but the fries I ordered (I've had them before at a yelp event and they were MUCH better back then) left a salty taste in my mouth so I held off.

Food came out really quickly and we both loved our burgers:DLUX, White fish, and backyard BBQ! His fish burger was AMAZING and I wish I had ordered it, but I loved mine as well. 

The Blue cheese and bacon fries have been delicious in the past but I didn't like them this time...I'll be back to try again though!!
I love their bruschetta.  I love their salads. I love their sandwiches.  I love their hot tea.  Oh and I love postinos.  If you want consistently good food and a great place to eat with friends this is the place for you.
What an adorable spot! Stumbled upon Sugar Happy while looking for a bookmarked lunch restaurant and after seeing "coffee and bakery" I was sold to return for dessert. Who doesn't want dessert after lunch on a Friday afternoon?! 

Upon entering, the ambience was super cute and very clean. Decor was tasteful and unique. I especially liked the little plants hanging on the wall in cute little planters. 

Fresh pastries were displayed inside a glass windowed counter and my eye immediately caught a pastry designed in the shape of a flower. It turned out to be an apple tart...ummm yes, please! It tasted just as delightful as it looked. Not too sweet, flakey, flavorful, and delicious. Each flower petal had a small slice of apple in it. Turns out, it was just baked an hour and a half before we got there. I could eat 5 of them! Luckily I didn't :)

I also ordered a cold brew coffee with vanilla sweetener and a splash of cream. They offer a full service coffee bar so you can definitely get your caffeine on here. I didn't order any other food but they do offer lunch and their specials were displayed on a little board next to the checkout counter. 

Employees were super friendly and after inquiring, I learned they've only been open for a few weeks. They seem to do a great job baking everything fresh. I overheard them talking about some of their pastry ideas and my mouth began watering just hearing about them. I will definitely return the next time I am in this area!
I love everything about this place. I initially made an appointment to have an annual check up\/cleaning. They sent an automated text to remind me of the appointment. Office manager Tori greeted me with a big smile. I forgot to bring my dental insurance card, but she verified everything over the phone for me. Assistant Tiana was knowledgeable and super friendly. Dr. Lee was compassionate and skilled. They found a cavity and I was able to receive the procedure almost immediately. Dr. Lee did such a great job, I felt no pain or discomfort (almost dosed off during the procedure). I'm glad that I found them. I can't wait to come back, and I will recommend the team to anyone.
Worst bar I have ever been to. Terrible food, terrible service. I hated this place. The bartender that was serving me was extremely condescending like it was me who was providing a service. Furthermore the locals were really rowdy and just disrespectful to people who they did not recognize. I even had multiple drinks placed onto my card by other people who were in the establishment and the bartender DID NOT confirm this with me. He just la-dee-da swiped it. I refused to pay and was furious that he would even think that was ok. He said he was going to swipe it anyway because it was on my tab... He decided not to when I offered the possibility of law enforcement to come fix the situation. He didn't as well because it was announced multiple times that there were underage patrons drinking and within the bar. This place should not be allowed to function at all anymore and I will never be returning to this place ever again.
Solid 4 star place. 

Someone in my party mentioned the milkshake was good but it had chunks of chocolate in it and I thought it would be more of a smooth taste. This is just personal preference. Similar to not wanting pulp in oj. 

There are a wide array of chocolates and other items. The ice cream is second to none. 

Prices are a little steep but it is all homemade therefore I can understand why. 

The workers were relatively nice and did a good job.  I wish I could try everything but it would have been impossible on one trip. 

We will be back!
I always stop in at Fabulous Freddy's when I need a Full Service car wash. They clean the car inside and out and they always do a fairly decent job. It's the only place in the neighborhood that offers full service, other than Terrible Herbst. FF does a little better job, so I go here. I think they give you a discount on fuel with a wash too. I always seem to have a full tank when I come here, so I have not used the discount yet.
Delicate chairs in candyfloss hues, tiny model birds in ornate cages, inviting and rotund jars of sweets on the windowsill, and the cakes, oh the cakes, lining the counter with a riot of colour and a promise of delight... This is my kind of place.

Arriving a little early for my meeting over the road, I decided to take advantage of the time by finally sampling the delights of Mimi's, and I am so very glad I did. My day has thenceforth proceeded in a smooth, sweet, sugared manner much befitting a Friday.

First of all, that raspberry and chocolate brownie. Now that's how you make a brownie! Big, gooey, and packed full of rich, rich flavour, it was the brownie of my dreams. You could probably have used my fork to perform surgery, I licked it so clean. Then there's that pot of Teapigs tea, which was exactly what I needed. I (most unlike me) didn't put sugar in it, because I think I might have had an aneurysm if I had sugar in my tea alongside a brownie like that. And it was a perfect pairing.

The only dropped star here is that I would never have expected a brownie and a pot of tea to come to well over five pounds, but given the size - and oh the quality! - of the thing, it's not entirely unreasonable (slightly, but not entirely). I suppose I could say that this dropped star also covers the fact that every time I stood up, my head ended up instead the birdcage, but actually that would be inaccurate as a) it is my fault I am so very very tall like a gangly spangly heron and b) I quite enjoyed the experience and, had I been alone, might have remained there for some minutes singing and pretending to be the misfit giant birdie among all my teeny weeny feathery friends.

I might still be a bit high on sugar.
I called Saturday to schedule an appointment due to our regular groomer being out of town as we have gone to Sniffany a few times.  The cut is usually good however how they schedule appointments is crazy.  

I specifically asked the groomer how long it would take.  She replied 3 hours.  OK our normal groomer is done in 1.5 but I figured maybe it was because he was a little grown out.  Called when the 3 hours was up and was told another hour, it ended up be 4 hours and 20 minutes!  Really for a 16 pound dog who likes to be groomed????

I was so upset, we do not cage our dog and that means he has been sitting in a cage this entire time?  The girl at the desk then proceeds to tell me they are short staffed.  Why not share that information when someone schedules and specifically asks how long it would be.  If I had known that I would have scheduled on another day, however it seems to always be the case with Sniffany and Company.  They overbook or are understaffed and do not feel it is necessary to share that with their clients.  We will definitely be trying Barking Dogs next time we are in a bind and need a cut for our dog.
Listen up people, the new Gelato Sheriff is in town and it isn't Mick Dundee! *Just to be clear*

A little scoop of home has finally hit American shores and it will change your pallet for gelato. Messina is an extremely popular gelato chain back in Australia with stores in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland.

All of the gelato is made from top quality produce, and all gelato and other items are made in the onsite kitchen which you will be able to view while at Messina.

A couple of thing I can recommend:
- Flat White Coffee.... Better than any other in Vegas
- Bounty gelato - it's actually a chocolate bar in Australia with The equivalent being Almond Joy without the almonds
- Cones are pretty dam good! 

Overall
Food: 5-5
Drink: 5-5
Service: 5-5
Coming back: yes or till my pants break
Great old school grocery store. They have pretty great prices on produce and they are my "go to" for a bunch of different products. They have two lanes just for organic products which is pretty extensive. They carry a lot of my favorite "specialty products" which is just amazing. There is a huge selection of cards and they have a humongous alcohol selection which is a whole separate store attached to the main store. 

Had to knock two stars off because:
1. decor and shelf set up is just so outdated and not appealing. It's depressing
2. they don't accept and credit cards! Boo!
I had the pleasure of attending Rustler's Rooste for my company's Christmas party. The restaurant is really fun and enjoyed the atmosphere immensely. The slide...is awesome! The view and patio are also great! The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the meats we were served at the luncheon. The steak was more than well done and the chicken was dry. I know if I came back to the restaurant and had the chance to order something else, I would be happy. Also, for some reason, I couldn't connect to their Wi-Fi. I would have loved to post on social media that I was there but my phone wouldn't connect.  

I want to come back sometime in the evening to enjoy music, the view and the company. I will return!
This noodles is, of course, like all the other ones, same standard style to the decorating, same food, same everything. There is one thing I would like to touch on about this particular location and that is; its location. It is in a great place near a lot of cool places in Fitchburg. Fitchburg isn't the biggest city in the world but we endure! My favorite thing is that it is right near a Great Dane Pub and it is in the same strip-mall area as a Starbucks so after a little dinner you can go grab a cup of coffee or a beer! The staff at this location are also always so nice and always have a lot of energy, they are quick with bringing food out and very respectful. That is a big part of a place's review, in my opinion.
All the stars in this review go for the amazing service and charming rooftop patio. 

The disappointments were the food - which came out cold and the drinks which were solid but nothing to write home about. 

I think this is a good place to come with a group bc the service is so lovely and they have a huge menu of drinks. Skip the food though!
Great food and atmosphere! Prices are very reasonable. A perfect place to grab a bite to eat or meet a friend for a cocktail.
Sit down and prepare yourself as I tell you something that will change your life. 

Ready?

Caffe Boa's brunch is the best in Phoenix. Hands down. I'm also making this claim without having ever been past the patio. If you don't believe me, check out the amazing photos I added.

The patio is so gorgeous and serene you don't even realize you're right down smack dab in the middle of college central. The vines growing along the side and the umbrellas suspended from the roof are simply magnificent. The place settings are beautiful, and listening to the birds tweet as they hop around all while a great breeze blows makes it instantly calming enough to warrant going by yourself, serene enough for talking business, and sexy enough for a date. 

The staff is phenomenal, and our server, Bri, was just the best ever. She helped me through some very tough Sunday morning meal decisions as well as explained all about Caffe Boa and how many of their items on their dinner and new brunch menu are made from scratch, organic, and\/or locally grown. The brunch menu also has only been around a few weeks. I'm glad that I stopped by before word spreads.

I started off with the white sangria, which wasn't sold by the glass until brunch. Additionally, during brunch, the pitchers of sangria are half off. The glass was huge and full of flavor and goodness. It was filled with apples, grapes, oranges, and cherries and was absolutely delightful. After the sangria, I had to try the mimosa, and I was not disappointed. Mimosas, Bellini, and champagne are 8 per glass or 18 bottomless at brunch. And yes, you can mix and match them. It may sound a little pricey, but they would kick the ass of the 2 dollar mimosas many places have. Total weaklings they are compared to this masterpiece.

After going round and round on just what I wanted to order, I settled on the eggs benedict which had prosciutto, poached eggs, and basil hollandaise over an English muffin. On the side was an amazing goat cheese and tomato (though I did without tomato). I added some cracked pepper and unbleached wine rock salt. Decadent. Simply exquisite. I don't typically care for salt and I couldn't help but keep putting a tiny pinch on my meal. 

The service was just the right speed for a brunch, not too fast and not too slow. I don't like to be rushed on a Sunday morning. I was able to enjoy myself and take in the amazing food I was eating as well as enjoy the scenery, which made me believe I really had been transported to a gorgeous countryside when I walked in the door. 

I will gladly come here again for brunch, and despite my typical dislike of pasta, the description Bri gave us, has me craving that as well.

It was decadent down to every last tiny detail and I left completely satisfied from head to toe, like I had been on a romantic getaway or a day at the spa.
Great dinner. I had the Devils on Horseback and Pork Pappardelle. My lovely had the Beet Salad and Spring Chicken. We shared a Strawberry Cheesecake in a jar. Great service. Highly recommend. Book early. We'll go back, no doubt.
We happen to drive by the place and decided to stop by and eat for lunch. We decided to dine-in.

We ordered egg rolls, I had the kung pao shrimp lunch special, and the husband had sesame chicken lunch special (for the lunch special you get fried rice, lo mein and a drink).  

To be honest the place looked like a dump. The walls were covered with food stains of some sort (looks like boogers). The chairs wobbles and the tables were chipped. Looks old and worn down. (if only I had seen all this before our food arrived) We were kind of worried that we might get food poisoning, but we took the risk. 

The eggs rolls were okay, nice and hot, crispy on the outside, but for my taste very bland. The kung pao shrimp was okay, I expected to have more shrimp, but their were only about 6, their was some nice flavors. The rice and lo mein were also bland. They had some onions in the lo mein that tasted awful, which made the whole lo mein taste bad. The lo mein tasted so bad that I had to spit it out (I think the onions were old).

The sesame chicken was good. It was crispy on the outside and you get a whole bunch compared to the kung pao shrimp. Their was tons of sauce with the sesame chicken, no complaints there. But the husband did agree that the lo mein was pretty awful. 

The service was good. The lady who took our order was friendly. Our food came out less than 10-15 minutes. 

The question is, would we come back here again? No. Would we recommend the place? No.
Dennys level food at Bouchon level prices. All this would be okay, given the convenience and location inside the casino except for the super slow service. Our two omelettes took over 25 min and the toast was cold by then. Not worth it IMO.
This is a first class family operated, honest operation. I had drip irrigation put in and thought they damaged pool water pipe feed causing loss of pump suction.  Amazing Leak Detection came out and determined it was a sensitive setting on the valves.  They can detect more than leaks.  Very pleased with service, honesty and staff.
Went to this place as part of my Tast of Old Town Scottsdale Tour and was immediately charmed by the establishment.
Loved all the belly pots of olive oils and vinegars, loved Kelsey who gave us the samples, loved the atmosphere.
Love places like this~ a bit unique, a bit of an experience.  Hard to leave this place without buying something so of course we did!
Review #300

4 Stars *****

This place is located in a less than desirable area. It is on Highland Dr near the strip club district. Nonetheless, it was definitely worth the trip.

I am giving my 300th review to Rollin' Smoke BBQ. Definitely a solid 4 star meal when it comes to BBQ beef brisket. I just tried the Brisket 3 Ways which consisted of sliced brisket, chopped brisket, and burnt ends. The meat was very good on its own, but I added some of their Arkansas BBQ sauce to it. I thought their bbq sauce was excellent. They also offered a sweet bbq sauce, but I preferred the tangy version. I also ordered a side of waffle cut fries, which were seasoned very well.

I will definitely be back to try the beef ribs and some other menu items. I will probably add another star on my next visit if the beef ribs are as good as the brisket.
J'ai hésité à mettre 2*...Alors admettons  que je donne une note de 2.5\/5. Voici pourquoi...

J'ai été le midi. Le menu est très bien...que ce soit à la carte ou le menu midi. 23$ environs  pour le repas midi, qui inclus un choix d'entrée et le plat principal. Il y a aussi un menu midi dégustation à 40$. Je sais que le menu change quand même  assez souvent...la journée où j'ai été, j'ai pris la salade de betteraves  et chorizo. Petite..très petite, mais excellente!. C'est servi en plus sur un plat qui ressemble à un plat de terre noire.  Très belle présentation! J'ai ensuite décidé de prendre la bavette de boeuf, servi avec légumes et purée et choux fleur.  J'ai bien aimé les légumes et surtout  la purée, la bavette était correct..mais aurait été meilleur si elle avait été saignante comme j'ai demandé...elle était médium saignant. Il n'y avait pas de poivre sur la table, et venant d'un resto un peu plus haut de gamme avec les ingrédients  qu'ils utilisent, on aurait pu  avoir un service de poivre sorti du moulin. 

J'avais tellement faim que j'ai mangé 2 tranches  de pain, qui vient de la boulangerie affilié  La bête  à pain. Le pain avec différentes sortes de graines est délicieux...miam!

Pour le moment j'aurai mis un 4*, par contre...pouet pouet pouet...Le service a fait descendre la note comme ça ne se peut pas. Par exemple, un de mes collègues a simplement répété langue de bison (un élément sur le menu) et le serveur à dit d'un air bête...MAIS OUI L'ANIMAL" comme si on ne savait pas. Il était bête et a mal répondu à un autre collègue car celui-ci ne savait pas un truc sur le vin...Bref...Un monsieur qui n'aime pas sa job ou qui a des préjuger sur les gens qui viennent dîner au chic restaurant  sans être habillé en veston cravate.

Bref...en terminant...si vous êtes un groupe de 8 ou plus...on exige que le paiement soit fait comptant car...selon notre "sympathique" serveur...Faire payer 8 personnes chacun avec une carte débit ou crédit ça prends 2 min par personne et quand on est 8...on vient déjà de perdre 16 GROS MINUTES...J'aurai compris si Monsieur avait été dans le gros rush...mais non il y a une autre serveuse et en plus une vrai gentille madame qui est au comptoir à l'entrée pour faire payer les gens...Bref...j'ai payé Intérac TEN TOE
This place is awesome!  They have a great selection of different teas, slushes, and toppings.  Plus you can customize your drink with sugar and ice level.  I tried the House Swirl Milk Tea with pudding and 50% sugar level and it was great!
Alright, I admit, this is not my type of crowd or environment and that's part of the reason for the low rating.  Hey, you do it for the Scottsdale bars - so leave me alone!

Our group headed here after Oktoberfest for a few drinks, and after finding a long wait for Rula Bula we ended up here where it was pretty dead.  Inside, there were a bunch of older creeps creeping on the scantily clad bar staff.  Outside, it was cramped and stinky of smoke.  The service at the bar was just okay....not particularly friendly or fast.  

I wouldn't return here because I'm not in college and I'm not an older creep.  If out on Mill, I'll stick to Rula Bula.
Diamond was so helpful, so sweet and truly made my experience so relaxing and not so hectic! She listened to what I wanted, understood my concerns and definitely took weight off my shoulders. Anyone who goes in should go to her! Even though I didn't have an appointment she made my experience so amazing, she is definitely the girl to go to!
Small cozy cafe with local arts for sale. The shop is quiet and customers here are very chill, relaxing. Owner is super nice and always engage in conversations with customers. It seems there are lots of regulars frequent here as well. 

I ordered a latte and cappuccino and both were smooth and delicious. Coffee was not too bitter and nicely balanced. 

P\/S: one brownie point for having cat mugs. I like cats and the owners were super nice to give me the latte in a cat mug LOL.
There were some really good moments during my lunch experience here.  The hostess already put me in a relaxed mood when I called in to make my reso.  I asked for a table for two either 12:30 or 1 and she said "let's reserve your table for 12:45 and you can come whenever you choose" which was a good thing because we showed up at 1:15 and of course they didn't make a fuss at all.  

I started with raw tuna if I remember correctly.  Don't know what it's called but it was served on a thin flake of something crunchy and orange centred radish slices on top.  The main was the halibut which came with the most delicately roasted vegetables.  I found the halibut itself a bit salty but I'm not sure if that because I'm from Vancouver and the halibut is different on the west coast.  Nevertheless this fish was very moist with melt in your mouth qualities.  I have to admit I wasn't sure about this texture as some parts were almost crumbly but I gave the chef the benefit of the doubt.  And let me say, it was brilliant to offer recommended pairings for only $7 for the demi size.  The wine came from some obscure places like Serbia but they tasted amazing.   The dessert was the only thing I wish could have been more exilirating on the tastebuds but the coffee was cherishable.

Overall good food and service.  My only real criticism is they could try make the experience more exciting, and by that I mean making the food exude more attitude.  Almost as though you be thinking "damn the chef is bad a s s".  The interiors were a bit eccentric.  And the soft spokeness or lack there of of the other patrons made me feel like I was in an Atom Egoyan film.  Only instead of the Leonard Cohen soundtrack there was no music today.
Total let down! Went a few weeks ago after waiting for about 30min (which wasn't a surprise seeing how busy they were) we were excited because we have heard so many great things. I felt like we were being rushed (I get it you need to turn tables over) after ordering. We received our food. I feel to even call it mediocre would be a compliment. And then I was charged for a drink I didn't order and it was only two of us. Service wasn't great either everyone looked depressed I won't be back to give this place a second chance after the bad taste it left in my mouth.
Hanny's is a little different. We went on a Saturday night for a drink but they weren't overly busy. After waiting at a bar with two bartenders for 15 minutes (with very few customers) I ordered my drink. It wasn't made correctly and the bartender held on to my card even though I wanted to close out. That took another 5 minutes to get back. Overall, not impressed.
So I went to a late lunch with the Moms this weekend. 

(One plopped me out and the other is her BFF that's been around long before I was doing boom-boom and creating crayon masterpieces on the wall.) 

They wanted salads somewhere downtown. And all the places I've never been to but have been wanting to go to for ages were either closed or greens free-- LoLo's (collard don't count), Palatte, Cheuvront, Cibo, My Florist, and so on.

So Moms decided that Coach and Willie's was the perfect luncheon destination.

(Cuz they thought the salads online looked purdy tasty, and they were right. But I shouldn't have "judged a book by its cover," since even McDonald's looks pretty good in commercials.)

So I swing by to pick up my sis and we dash to Coach and Willie's. I thought the name sounded like a bastard love filly to a Pony Express stud. Or maybe some purebred dog name, like Sir Charles McWigglesworth.

Easy to find. Parking was plentiful. Patio was neato. Sunken bar seemed like a novelty. Horseshoe shaped booths were comfy and inviting. Atmosphere was upscaley for a sports bar. Company was vivacious. Waitress was engaging and attentive. Bacon wrapped prawns were succulent and satisfying. My Woodchuck cider was tasting crisp and peary. And I had a big ole smile on my face.

It was salad time. 

Now if a salad costs ten dollars, I expect more than a tasteless expanse of iceburg lettuce. What head chef uses iceburg lettuce any more? With all the varieties of salad greens to chose from, I end up with the tasteless, tacky trailer trash of the field greens world? I'm not saying you gotta get all pretentious with a salad by using micro greens grown in an organic hot house, but for fuck sake, iceburg? Airplanes and cafeterias are the only places I've ever encountered iceburg not in fancy pants wedge salad form, which classes it up some and acknowledges the fact that iceburg is tasteless filler devoid of nutrients of any sort.

Is Coach and Willie's food comparable to airplane fare? Ahem, yes. My salad was anyway. Everyone else seemed to enjoy theirs, despite the offensive iceburg. I just ate the equally tasteless southwestern chicken mass that came on top and picked around the lettuce filler. So while the lunch was fun and the bacon wrapped prawns were rockin', the salad sucked. And since I've only been here once, they get a less than stellar review. (And I'm stating that straight up so nobody gets all persnickety. I've only been once. For lunch. And a crap salad.)

I'm sure it's a fun place for drinks before a game or for a quick lunch with coworkers, but I'm taking a stand against iceburg lettuce. It should be eliminated on principle alone. (Aside from its uses as filler; see Navajo tacos and garnish.)

Anybody want to join my one woman campaign?
Stopped by during a flight delay. Wanted a quick bite. Grabbed an Asiago omelette. Fast service, taste great. However, was annoyed they charged $4.25 for Gatorade. Oh well, that's the price you pay for buying in the airport.
Salim's is the consummate place to pick up quick and satisfying snacks. I love his babaganoush and vegetarian stuffed grape leaves. And his hummus is some of the best around. Not my favorite spinach pies in town, but you can't win 'em all. You can also count on Salim's for basic Mediterranean grocery items. We just picked up some pomegranate syrup (real grenadine) to experiment with.
Came in for lunch and ordered the Mediterranean chickrn salad, chicken orzo soup, pulled chicken sandwhich and turkey chili. I was really wanting to like it, but everything I ordered was bland. Did I order all the not so flavorful items? I'll try it again, general rule "try everything twice
Never take phlebotomy with mrs lei sean. I have been  ro many colleges and  she is the  worst  teacher  i have ever  had.  She  will show  you  once  how  to do a procedure  once, then she goes to  her desk and does her own homework  and  doesn't  come around  to see if your  technique  is good  or not. She won't  acknowledge  she nade a mistake. Example  i asked her Monday  to make a copy of my flu shot  paper. She said sit it down  and  i will get to it. I asked her Tuesday  where is my flu  vaccine  paper? She attached  my original  copy to some papers  she was going  to  send out. She ripped  off my dlu vaccine  paper off and made a big rip on corner  of paper.  Rwo weeks before  supposed  to  graduate  she asked ne if i had my externship  paper? I said no you  never gave me one. She told me that shw gave me one but i lost it. I told her no you  never gave  me  one. The whole  class had their  sites picked out 3 to 4 weeks  ago.  If you  wanted  to  choose your own  site you  needed  that externship  paper  in 5 weeks before  externship.  I didnt  receive  my paper until  the school  is almost  over.  She yelled  at  me  in  front  of  the  class because  i got into  the  class without  her seeing my diploma. I complained  to  john about  her. SHE ALSO SNORTS DURING  CLASS
 YOU THINK IM JUST  MAKING  THIS UP.  SIT IN HER CLASS TO OBSERVE  HER
Some people may call this place in incomplete.. the hand painted signage on the windows that some use on their cars, the  patio tables for seating inside.. the empty feel it has. I, however, think it was on purpose. Some way, somehow, it causes instant relaxation. The brightly colored walls combined with the patio furniture really did calm me down and allow us to enjoy a two hour conversation without ever being pushed to leave. Hell, we didn't even get our bill until the wonderful Matt C. asked if we could pay. I've been wanting to get to this place for ages, but just never found the right time or occasion. It happened to be perfect earlier this week for dinner with a friend after I was picked up from the airport. 

The food description Matt C. described is accurate so I'll elaborate on other points. The menu, which we both took pictures of once we saw Goat Curry listed, is small and interesting. It leaves me wanting to come back, and yes, next time, I will be getting the goat curry. I'm sure you are all lining up to come with for my 2nd visit now. 

I had the jerk chicken with rice, plantains, and a side of vegetable (I had two to choose from - steamed eggplant or bok choy). It was very delicious. The rice was slightly dry and not very flavorful, and wasn't my favorite, but it was a nice addition to the jerk chicken, which had some decent spice to it, actually probably a little more than the curry from what I remember. 

The plantains, oh the sweet plantains were PHE NOM IN AL!!!!!! Well worth it.  In addition we had a side of roti for the curry order and it was some delicious bread. Probably the best bread I've had aside form nan. Why do other countries make bread so much better than us? Is it because we all try to swear ourselves off of carbs?

To drink, I had pink ting. I know, not surprising. It was a carbonated pink grapefruit beverage using Jamaican pink grapefruit, bottled in Jamaica, but a product of Canada. That made me giggle, but it was delicious. And, well, the name itself makes it worthy.

Overall, this place was reasonably priced, and allowed us to enjoy our meal slowly, and talk for hours afterwards. The staff is truly genuine. If you're in the area, I'd definitely stop here. 

The food is a 3, but the atmosphere is a 4, and I'm giving A Taste of the Caribbean benefit of the doubt.
I love this place! Easy to get to and the food is always comforting and delicious. Steak salads are great! The guys are always friendly and fast.
The sesame bread is amazing. The sandwich was huge but I ended up eating the whole thing. Very very good!
Boar's head meats and cheeses are what they use for their sandwiches, and they also have olives,and some other deli items. The sandwiches are great, and the service is friendly. I miss their old employee John, he was such a charming, handsome young lad. :-( They even know Chris Burke!!!!
Free hiv and std check up done here which will save you up to 400 bucks. Staffs are all friendly and passionate. I appreciate this organization and will recommend to anyone.
Jeudi soir 10h pm, je suis avec des collègues. Nous cherchons un endroit pour prendre un verre et un propose cet endroit. De l'extérieur je suis vendu. Je vois pleins de bouteilles et un gros écriteau avec JEUDI OLD SCHOOL SPECIAUX etc etc. Ouain......je ne savais pas que Old school pour le DJ c'était Julie Masse, de la musique pas dansante et triste. Bref de la musique hyper déprimante. Je vais aux toilettes, les toilettes sont au deuxième et mixte...whats up l'intimité. Non pas que ça me dérange sauf que...c'est minuscule 2 toilettes pour couvrir beaucoup de gens gars et filles. Et on s'entends on est dans le vieux, pas au Milend ou dans le Village, alors on risque de retrouver des gens moins ouvert d'esprit. Bref, il y avait beaucoup de gens de bureau qui on dirait avaient allongé leur 5@ tard. Quelques personnes dans un état d'ivresse level 100000. Le service est lent. Par contre, on a une table pour 7. Trop sombre pour regarder le menu de cocktail et la musique continue à être déprimante. J'allume ma lampe de poche de cell. Il y a beaucoup beaucoup beaucoup de choix de cocktail!! En effet, avec les centaines de bouteilles qu'il y a sur le mur derrière le bar, cela ce comprend. Il y a une feuille de spéciaux. Bien sûre, nous sommes 7, mais seulement une seule feuille avec les speciaux nous est attribué. J'ai pris un Pisco Sour. Il est fait avec du blanc d'oeuf.  Très bon, mais un peu fort. Mes collègues avaient l'air satisfait avec leur drink. En plus ils sont en bas de 9$. 

Je prends ensuite une Sleeman en bouteille qui est en special à 3.91$ et le serveur me dit elles sont à 2 pour 8,50$ et je le regarde en lui disant ben sur le menu c'est écrit 3.91$. Il me regarde d'un air bête et me reponds..tu connais le menu mieux que moi... Bref...Oui j'y retournerai mais en 5@7. Car à 10h plus jamais. C'est un bar qui ma fortement dessus pour un jeudi soir.
Noodlehead has surprisingly well planned ambiance; I really love the layout and the sort-of (fancy) barn accents. The tables are well placed and spaced. I also appreciate their simple, no nonsense menu. But with so few vegetarian options, I am not likely to dine here over, say, Thai Cuisine. The dishes I've tried have been fine, but it'd be nice to be able to order an appetizer to go with my meal. They also have no trouble turning up the spice here, beware! My partner could hardly eat his spice level "3" dish that seemed to be ruined for him with overdone heat. I think they just add chili sauce or paste to increase the heat, not fresh peppers or anything delicious like that. So it's probably best to aim low with your requested level, then ask for chili sauce to add yourself.
I came in for lunch with two girlfriends while staying at the Monte Carlo - we were starving and Diablo's looked pretty cool from the outside.  

I ordered a shrimp salad which literally had exactly 3 shrimp sliced in half lengthwise then flipped over (cut side facing down) to appear to be 6 shrimp.  That, however,  is the least of my complaints.

One of the girls ordered tacos and asked for Tapatio. You know, a bottle of Tapatio.  She received a side of 3 salsas.  When she pointed out that this wasn't what she wanted the waitress told her they didn't have any and walked away.... adding a $6 charge for the salsas she delivered.

My other friend ordered a hamburger.  It didn't come with mayo so she asked for some.  The waitress brought a small side of mayo... adding a $3 charge to the bill.  (Notice a pattern here?)

About halfway through the burger my friend wasn't looking so hot. She said it tasted funny.  In an instant there she goes running to the ladies room to vomit it back up...  She came back to the table  practically green.

We reported this to our waitress who obviously didn't care at all or apologize - she simply rolled her eyes, took the burger away and dropped off the bill. After noticing that we had still been charged for the burger in addition to the $6 salsa charge and $3 mayo charge we asked to speak with a manager. 

The manager approached our table with attitude and before we could even tell him that the burger made me friend sick he said that he already knew and he "tasted her burger and it tasted fine to me - maybe she threw up because of alcohol."  I explained that we hadn't started drinking yet - it was only lunch time. When I brought up the charges for condiments. (Seriously?! THREE DOLLARS FOR MAYONNAISE?!) I told him "I've never been charged for condiments at a restau-" he interupted me and said, "Well, we do."  I told him they should at least tell people instead of just bringing it out then adding it to the bill.  He snipped back "Oh, well I guess you expect me to comp the whole bill then?"  

I wasn't going to argue with that.  "Yes, that would be great.  Thank you."  We threw down some cash for the tip only and walked out. 

I'd give them a zero rating if I could. The food made one of us sick, they charge for everything to pad the bill, and the manager that I dealt with was a rude prick. I wouldn't go there again if they paid me.
With Vegas full of corporate chains ie Mcdonalds, pizza hit, subway etc it was finally refreshing to find a place like Rachel's Kitchen. The menu is full of great healthy fresh options which are hard to find in Las Vegas. The service is always great but when it is a little busy it might take a little longer to get your meal. Any of the juice options can be a little strong if it's your first time trying them. 

I recommend this place if your looking for an healthy alternative to the regular places
BEST Buffet in Vegas. 
Everything tastes like they cared. Or at least cared enough for presentation's sake. my uncle always told us - if it doesn't look good, don't eat it. And this place make other buffets look like cafeterias. There aren't mounds of food, the food is plated in individual pots\/bowls or if on a big dish, pleasantly placed.
I loved the cheese stuffed pesto gnocchi. French toast. Meat. The full gelato bar, and piles of strawberries.
The lunch was so good. Best price for buffet satisfaction.
Fine spot for dropping off packages in pre paid boxes or "free" priority mail boxes.

They have a stamp machine in the lobby and the standard drive through mail drop off in the lot.

The line always looks long and the urgency is no where to be found.

The parking lot is twisty with a tempting do not enter shortcut.
Years ago this used to be my watering hole on the way home from work. Of course that was quite a few years ago.

It used to be a great spot back then.
New name is Poblanito . . Still trying to rev things up , new restaurant but I think the food is fresher than most and the place has a manager with character, Jose ..
Yes!!!! I lucked out and found another awesome diner!! Again I love places like this it seems to have an at home  nostalgic feeling. I ordered a vegetable plate and was very satisfied . The prices are very reasonable. The staff is very welcoming and friendly I will definitely be back!!!
So I went to Stingray for a quick lunch the other day while my son was in play practice.  I walked in, the place was not crowded.  I got seated and the waitress gave me the menu.  
Looking through the menu, I ordered their sushi lunch which on the menu read- 3 pieces each of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, 8 pieces of California roll, 4 pieces of sushi, rice, soup, and salad for $14.  Since I was hungry, that was what I ordered.
The food came in a bento box- there was the 3 pieces each of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, rice and salad and I had gotten the soup beforehand.  Okay, I figured I was getting the rest of the order on the waitress's next round.
My 4 pieces of sushi and 8 pieces of Californai roll never came.  When I asked the waitress about them, she came back with 4 pieces of California roll and told me that I was not getting the rest of my order because they made a mistake in printing out their "new" menu, in a rush for their new Biltmore location.  And she said it in not a very nice way as in "well, wouldn't that be a great deal to get all that food for $14!"
I did not make a fuss as I was full with what was brought to me . . . when I went to pay my check, they billed me for $15 instead of $14.  When I started to get annoyed, they took a whopping $1 off my check.  Really?  One dollar?  I got half of the food that I ordered!
Needless to say, I am not impressed with a place that does not honor what is PRINTED clearly in their menu- if it was a mistake, as a business owner, they should have honored the order and pulled the menu from being used.  
Stingray is a cool place to go have sushi but because of their business practice of not treating their customers right, I will not likely be going back there again.
The Cliff Notes Version...

I really my experience at Modern Nails! I will definitely be returning.
I don't want to spoil the party here, folks... I don't know. The Chocolate Tree just wasn't as much of a swizzle of fairy dust as I'd been expecting. It was nice, for sure. It was cosy and cute.

My expectations may have been too high; not that I was picturing myself leaving the premises like a confectionery version of Queen Elsa in Frozen, summoning flurries of rich chocolate at my fingertips, but suffice to say I was preparing to feel ensconced in a warm choccy glow, and instead I just felt like... Well that was nice.

I have something of an issue with places that don't make it clear whether you order at the counter or wait for service. To be honest, I'm still not entirely clear on that; it seems like a waitress service sort of place but after waiting for twenty minutes we ended up just going up and ordering. It's not a big place but always busy so be sure to book ahead. Cute and weeny, it fits in in the area very well, and let's not forget they also have a check in deal if you're in the market for buying chocolate bars! Always a good thing.

The hot chocolate was really very nice; sweet and in a nice big mug I could wrap my hands around. The legendary churros were less of a delight; a little dry and over-cinnamoned, I felt, but nice and twisty nonetheless and not stingy on the portion. And it's a genuinely lovely little shop; we sat in the tiny corner by the window and watched the world go by for a while. So in all, it's a definite three from me, in that I'd gladly return at someone else's suggestion but probably wouldn't be the person to suggest it myself.
Went for brunch today. Super disappointed in the salad bar. I guess I had high expectations going in because I was expecting something similar to Texas de Brazil. It was much smaller and nothing tastes great. The best part was the bottomless mimosas and bloody Mary's. The meat was okay nothing to fav over my favorite would have to be the garlic steak. Had a few issues checking out. But other than that it was okay. Don't think we will be back but that's only because I know we can get a better selection of food at the same price else where.
Been to Fogo de Chao (the standard), Texas de Brazil and now Via Brazil. So comparing Via to Fogo:

Salad bar - Fogo's is bigger but the quality is same. Rice better at Via.
Caipirhina - Via wins for smoothness of this classic drink from Brazil.
Cheese bread - Fogo gets the nod for lighter and fluffier dough.
Meat - tie. You will prefer some cuts at one locale over another but it's a wash in the end
Side dishes - Fogo wins here. Via has no fried polenta and their fried bananas pale in comparison to the maduros at Fogo.
Desserts - too full, couldn't eat any at Via.

Bottom line: Fogo is still the standard but you will not be disappointed by Via and I wouldn't hesitate to go to Via again. Luv that Brazilian churrascaria.
Super cute cupcake boutique that offers specialty cupcakes.  I noticed a frosting shot on the menu that sounded fun!

I grabbed 6 cupcakes ($24) to go for my cute friend who is pregnant.  She invited me over for dinner and there's no way is arrive empty handed.

I choose the s'more, red velvet, coconut, dark chocolate, and sprinkle cupcakes and invited the sprinkles employee to choose the last which she threw in the strawberry.

At my cute expectant moms house we split the coconut and s'more cupcakes.  The s'more topping was to die for with a yummy filling though the cake itself was only ok.  The coconut cupcake was way more impressive with a delicious scent and a fuzzy glitter coconut snowball dome topping.  My friend and I both liked this best!

I did not try the rest but I'm sure she, her husband and baby enjoyed them.
Came here with a group of people after seeing a concert in Planet Hollywood, and we sat down right away even though the place seemed pretty busy for almost midnight.

The server made the whole experience. He was a pro at handling a bunch of drunk stumblers who think they are hilarious (myself included, ok it was just me). It was nice through out the whole time that we were here and made me actually want to go back to one of the PF's in my city. I refused to go because most of the servers are stuck up and they pretend like you can't get the same food at a cheaper faster price at Pei Wei.
We made dinner reservations here for our group of 16.  They had the table ready on time.  The service was decent for a large group, but our server did miss a few people at times.

The food is ok.  We ordered several appetizers for the table.  I will say the beef carpaccio was quite tasty.  The little bits of toast and the fresh cheese made it a nice treat.  The other appetizers were standard fair for an Italian chain restaurant.

For my meal i ordered the veal parmigiana.  I rarely get to eat veal so i generally pounce on the opportunity when it presents itself.  The meal was ok.  I was not impressed at all.  I would expect the same quality at a national chain.

I ordered the tiramisu for dessert.  It was pretty good.  It was a large portion.

Overall this place is ok.  Unfortunately it is no better than the standard national italian chains.  I was hoping to avoid the chain level of food.
Very nice restaurant.  Went for a quick business day lunch.  Server was attentive and informative.  A lot of options for lunch, at varying price points.  The interior reminds me of 131 Main, not too far away.

I had the crab cakes lunch.  Crab cakes were excellent - good chunks of crab meat, cooked perfectly.  They were a little on the small side, but it was adequate for lunch.  The Napa slaw was very good, but there was a huge portion of that on the plate.  I opted to upgrade my side to the skillet mac & cheese.  This was very tasty, but the up-charge was $4, which I thought was a little steep for that (the fries that come with the lunch are listed at $3.95 as a side item, the mac & cheese was $5.95, the up-charge should be $2 at most, right?).

I finished the lunch with the coconut cupcake.  I am very wary of coconut desserts as they tend to be overly sweet.  Not the case here, this coconut cupcake was perfect - the "cake" part was more like a shortcake than a cupcake.  The icing was a creamy toasted coconut, just sweet enough.  Perfection.

While I didn't have any drinks for lunch, I noticed that their wine selection and "by the glass" selections were excellent.
When our house was first built in 2005 we had a Freus unit installed. Since that point we have always used Omega AC and have always been really happy with their service. It does not matter if it is on the phone with Christina or Candy or when they guys come up for the service. Unfortunately due to the hard water we have the up keep just got to be too much this week. I came home to a 88 degree home on Tuesday. I called and spoke to Candy at 5:05pm and Chris was out to the house not too much later. He did everything he could to save our system but when the cost of the repair just got to high he helped us talk through it and we opted to go for a new system. We had a very small hiccup the very next day, my appointment was at 12pm but when I came home IT WAS ALREADY IN!!!!   Overall, who can complain about a brand new AC being able to be installed the next day and already have been done in the morning. Unfortunately where I could not be there we could not get it running, but Candy and Chris coordinated a time to come back and we are up and running!!! You guys are awesome! Even though we won't see you as much for our old Freus, I will recommend you to EVERYONE I know!!!

Thank you to each and every one at Omega AC - Christina, Candy, Chris, Jose, Gary, Alex (that is everyone I can remember, sorry if I missed anyone).
Decor is cute but it doesn't go together at all and although i'm sure they are doing that on purpose and going for a charming\/quaint look it really isn't working. 

I had a black coffee and plain waffle. Waffle was amazing (of course:)) and delivered very promptly. Coffee wasn't freshly brewed and the canister of the medium roast was out (and i didn't want to wait for them to fill it) so i just got the dark roast. It was decent but not great coffee.

There was an assorted group of people at 10am on a weekday--moms with their kids, businessmen having a meeting, a guy meeting his contractor, and the hippy college kid. It was a fun crowd.

If im in the area and really needing caffeine i might be back but no special trips out here.
I'm a regular. The place is great for friends and family. Great selection in wing sauces. The service is awesome. Bike night is amusing and great wing specials through out the week. 32oz beers for $4 dollars. 100 OZ of beer for $9.99! Great outdoor area.
This is one of two pizza places located inside the New York New York Hotel. I tried both of them being that I'm a huge New York style pizza fan. I would say that Sirrico's is the best one.

The slices were very big. I went with just cheese slices. The sauce was good, and the crust was to as well. Stays open really late, so after a night of hanging out (or winning some money at the casino) walk over there and enjoy a slice.
Friendly Service and a DYNAMITE menu of coffee, teas and other nifty edibles. My favorite drink is the Creme Brûlée Latte. I am completely addicted to it. They also have Jasmine tea and that is another favorite of mine. I also enjoy the fact that they can email your receipts to you , less paper and impact on our Earth. Sunrise is centrally located and lovley little gem of Las Vegas.
Tip: call ahead and make a reservation if you don't want to wait because it can get busy. Great service here and the noodles have been consistent all 4 times we've gone. Any noodle will be really awesome - savory, chewy and soup is nice and hot which I love. This is one of our regular spots now. Yum!
I stopped by this shop yesterday to get my first pair of cycling shoes and cleats.  They had a small selection of maybe 6 shoes ranging from around $50 to $150.   I was clueless, and was thankful when Cody came over to help me.  He did a great job explaining to me the difference in shoes and cleats, as well as talking to me about my needs.  He showed me sizes and I picked out a middle range pair that could take me from spinning class to road biking.  

The shop was empty so Cody took the time to talk to me about getting a road bike, something I need to do in the next month.  I really liked that he respected my price range, and actually encouraged me to start with the basics and not go all out buying the best (ie expensive) equipment.  Refreshing!  He showed me a catalogue of competitive road bikes in my price range, and hopefully they'll have those in soon - I'll be back!!  

Apparently they have a shop in Ahwatukee, and are opening 2 new stores.
Date night standard! One of the few restaurants the hubby and I can agree on.

We have visited WCG at least a dozen times and always had a great meal.

Our favorites: filet Cobb, honey carrots, BBQ bacon burger!!!

The only bad thing I've had here is their house margarita, which is made with a mix not fresh lime! Ew
It was ok, I don't think it's super special, like any other burger joint. The popcorn had a special pop but other than that I'm not super wow-ed
I've been going here for over 9 years. Great prices for great quality. My acrylic nails used to break all the time and it RARELY ever happens now. Holly has been my tech for the last 5 years. Pedicures are great too! Definitely check them out! And if you pay with cash you get a 10% discount!
Andrea is truly an amazing artist! Everything she touch turns into a work of art. She is personable and is very open. She exuberates so much positivity that it shows in the way she deals with her clients. It is so rare to find someone who truly loves what they do. Andrea is one of them.

We had a clear understanding of what we expect from each other. She will do her best to understand what you need and want and she will walk you through the process before she begins. The end result did not disappoint! The results speak for themselves.

I highly recommend to come see Andrea if you are looking for a change and is not sure what to do. Andrea will be more than helpful. Again,thank you, Andrea!
Love watching these beautiful fountains whenever I'm walking the Strip.  I'm a local, and have gotten to experience them many times.  I really like that they're every 15 minutes; if it's anytime during the day and night (before midnight), you won't have to wait long to see a show.  As of right now, I haven't experienced the same song twice.  This and their indoor garden make the Bellagio my favorite casino in all of Las Vegas.
I had to come here to get my sheriffs card. I haven't been here for about five years. I remember it being as busy as the DMV. I came here today (Thursday) at 2pm and there is no line. Maybe later in the day is the best time to go, or maybe I got lucky.
Noodle Asia is inside the Venetian Hotel, in the corner of the Casino near the Sports Book. 

It should be called Noodle China. 95% of the dishes are some variety of Chinese food, be it Shanghainese, Taiwanese, Cantonese. 

Sure, they throw in a couple of Japanese things, like Edamame appetizer, and something that is wok fried udon? (More typically, this would be yakisoba, or fried soba noodles). And they do have at least 1 Korean dish, Kimchee! I didn't see any Viet noodles, Thai noodles, Korean noodles, Singaporean noodles, or more Japanese noodles, etc. 

The atmosphere is casual, with an open view of the large woks in the kitchen, with the water flowing over the cooking area to remove all the grease and tidbits spilled in the stir-fry cooking process, just like a Chinatown kitchen. 

The food isn't bad actually. The green veggie of the day was a choice of Gai Lan (Chinese Broccoli) or Baby Bok Choy. I went for the Bok Choy. NIce small baby stems. 

I also ordered a bowl of Nau Nam Mein Curry Soup, or Brisket of Beef Curry Noodle Soup, It hit the spot and warmed me up, as I was chilled by the overactive air-conditioning in the Venetian. I don't know how those cocktail waitresses in the skimpy, short , sleeveless, bar wench dresses can stand the chill. Their dual weather barometers definitely would perk up in the nippyness.  Mine did!

I also ordered an oolong tea, which came in a cast iron Japanese style tea pot. 

The service is just a little friendlier than a Chinatown diner. But they are strict about waiting to be seated! IF you seat yourself, they may call you out on it! There is a bar you can eat at and watch the cooks, or plenty of tables where you can watch the gamblers and those freezing waitresses. 

So Oolong tea, baby bok choy, and Brisket of Beef Curry Noodle soup. Sounds like about $10 in your typical Chinatown, right?

This is Vegas baby, try and guess again. Go higher, way higher! 

How about $30!?
For one person?!? WTF! 

If you are a cheap Chinese person raised in Chinatown or FOB, or if you are less than fourth generation ABC, don't go here! You will feel ripped off!  This is not Hon's Won Ton on Kearney in SF for sure! 

Tea: $3.50
Stir Fried Bok Choy: $12.00
Curry Beef Noodle Soup: $12.95
Tax: $2.30
Total $30.75!

You are better off driving down Spring Mountain just outside of the Venetian, due west to about Valley View, and go to Las Vegas' Chinatown. (Actually, unlike Noodle Asia, you can get Viet, Korean, Thai, and most of the other noodles of Asia from there.)
If you are Vietnamese or appreciate Vietnamese food, and are looking for Bo Bay Mon (7 Courses of Beef), this is the best place in the Montreal Metro area to get it. 

It may not be as good as Westminster's Little Saigon or San Jose, but for Montreal, it is the best. This on recommendation of the Vietnamese locals.

If you like Beef and Vietnamese food, this is the choice for you. If you have never had this 7 course meal wich is becoming very popular on the West Coast of the US, check it out, or bring  a Viet friend to show you the ropes on how to eat each course.
Pho Lien is the best Vietnamese Beef Noodle (Pho Bo) restaurant in Montreal. Don't take my word for it, that is from the Vietnamese locals who know food. 

The owner used to run a factory locally, but when those opportunities went to China for cheaper costs, he had to shut down the Factory and try something different. So he went and hired the best Pho cook he could find, employed him for a year, and learned how to make good Pho. 

It isn't to California standards, but here in Montreal, C'est Magnifique!
This is the fourth location I've tried.  It's new, and clean and the food was good...

The "show" was not.  I think I get it.  We were put at a table with 5 junior high\/high school kids, and I don't know if maybe the chef thought..."these kids are never going to appreciate the show...and even if they do they won't tip" or what.  He cooked our food.  That's it.  My daughter was with us and she still loved watching it all unfold, but after he'd cleaned up for the evening, and moved to the next hibachi over from ours, we watched as he went through each and every trick I knew them typically to perform...out of the corner of my eye I saw him catch and spin the egg...then expertly split it over his spatula.  I saw him flourish his cooking implements, break out the little peeing plastic boy, light the volcano, flip food into people's mouths...etc.

We didn't get that treatment.  I get it.  Nobody relishes the idea of doing "all that work" and not getting the tip to match...but hey...that's your job, dude.  Make the most of it.  Do your best, put in the effort.

The food was good.  Really enjoyed it.  If it would have been less than good this would have dropped to a two.
Had a great meal at the Bonefish Grill last night, our first time dining here. The restaurant is fairly small, and gets crowded on a weekend night. We had a 40 minute wait, but with a couple of beers at the bar, it passed quickly. Their draft selection of beers seems limited, with only 4 being available. 

Jessie, our waitress, took great care of us and service was fast. They were running a non-RW affiliated special, four courses (appetizer, salad, entree, dessert) for $30. We chose to go this route, even though the famous Bang Bang Shrimp wasn't listed as an available appetizer. (Jessie told us it was on special on Wednesdays for $5 so we might come back then to try it.)

The food was very, very good. We loved the Wagyu Beef wontons. The Cesar salad was tasty, but a little too ice cold for my liking - it was hard to get any real flavor from it. I ordered the special filet, and my husband ordered the Ahi tuna, which arrived perfectly seared and rare on the inside. 

Based on our great experience, we will definitely return.
I started off with every intention of a good review about this place, because the food was amazing and because I love to give props to local joints popping up in Sky Harbor. 

I had the carnitas burrito minus the pico de gallo (ew tomatoes) and it was phenomenal. The perfect size. The perfect combination and proportion of ingredients. Carnitas that made me want to marry it. 

There was a long wait for tables so I ordered my food to go. I put my name in as well but had already eaten because I was starving. I sat at a table ready to crank out some work while waiting for a flight. 

Getting into a table with a carry on and a laptop bag is nearly impossible. I don't know why restaurants in airports continue to do this. This is a new restaurant. I really wish they had gotten it right.

When my server arrived, I notified him that I had ordered no more than 20 minutes ago, but that tables weren't available at the time, and that since I was already finished, I'd just like a glass of water. 

After 5 minutes he came back with my water and informed me in a very condescending manner that when the wait for tables filled up again, he would have to ask me to leave, because even though I ate while tables were not available,  I was not considered a paying customer.  

This is where the stars dropped to three. Why 2 then?

If he was serious, that's bullshit. If he was saying it to clear the table, it's still bullshit. And that's exactly what I did. As soon as I got to a stopping point I got up and left. No one said see you again soon. No one said have a good flight. In fact, I heard him laugh as I walked away. 

I'm sorry, but in an airport, you need to be sensitive to why someone is sitting in your restaurant. Sometimes it's because it's the only decent choice. Sometimes it's because they arrived batshit early scared to miss their flight. And sometimes, it's because their flight is delayed a few hours and they don't want to sit on a crappy airport chair. Or there isn't even one of those available.  Most of those scenarios are not good. You have a captive audience. People aren't driving from downtown Phoenix to Sky Harbor to eat at the airport Blanco and go home immediately after. And if I am starving and I order take out because a table is not available but still want to sit, don't be an ass.

I love your food, but the service is enough that I'll go elsewhere next time. It may even drive me to a chain restaurant down the hall.
My girlfriend and I have lived in Vegas nearly 40 years. We've been through Boulder City many times but never actually stopped anywhere other than to get gas.

Today we decided to play tourist in Boulder City. Many of the shops we stopped in made us feel very welcome. This was not one of them.

Upon entering the store there was a group of just over half a dozen people in there. They were probably just checking it out like us. Shortly after they left we heard one of the clerks comment to the other about how big the group was and how cheap they were not to purchase anything. 

We left shortly after hearing that comment. I work in retail myself and sure I've been know to complain about cheap customers but I always make sure they're out of earshot and they get my friendliest service. 

This place could use some lessons on customer service.

All this aside....the place did look great.
We were just there last night for my friend's bachelorette party. The place was surprisingly empty for a Saturday evening honestly. I was surprised. Regardless, I ordered a moscato (super tasty!). Our server was super slow despite there only being a few other people in the restaurant. We wondered a couple times if he was coming back. After ordering the steak and twice baked potatoes, we had a great time catching up!

Here's the reason for the 1 star: I am allergic to shellfish. Typically not super severe, but enough to cause vomiting and a swollen throat\/tongue. I haven't had a formal reaction in years. My friend\/bride-to-be ordered Lobster Mac and Cheese. I didn't think anything of it because the place seemed super nice and 99% of the time, most places will have separate areas for seafood, beef prep, etc. Unfortunately, my potatoes got cooked in the same steamy oven as her lobster (as told to us by the owner). I took one bite of my potatoes and immediately started having a reaction, swelling tongue and all. My friend came to check on me and I told her I was having an allergic reaction as I was throwing up in the restroom. Her sister got the owner and he went to investigate. The thing that bothers me is while this is all going on, never once did he actually talk to ~me~, everything was communicated through my friend's sister and I never once saw him personally. He took the food off the bill but we still had a charge for the wine that I half drank. My friend called my husband to pick me up and I ended up in the ER from about 10:30pm until about 1am so I could breath. For the owner's credit, he did openly admit that they didn't think cooking in the same area would cross contaminate and they would be changing their procedures. The main reason for my 1 star is that I wished the owner would have actually talked to me instead of avoiding me. It's embarrassing on both our ends, but it doesn't make me feel any safer when I seem to have been avoided when I was able to be out. Mistakes happen, and hopefully get fixed, and I definitely understand that. I just felt like the whole situation was treated more as an inconvenience rather than a serious health issue.
We live just minutes from downtown Gilbert and were looking for a new place to check out. My fiancé and I came on a Thursday evening around 6PM and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. A lot of large parties were there that night so the waiting area was really crowded and there was very limited seating to wait. We got our text saying a table was ready and were seated in a 4 top with a booth. 

Here are the things I really liked: The service was excellent- drinks were always refilled, we were asked several times how food was tasting and ended up staying a couple hours. Bartenders were great and the bar area is nice (and has all the TV's unless you sit outside on the patio). The food was really good- zucchini fries were hot and not overly battered. I got the breakfast burger and it was a party in my mouth! It came with a fried egg, cheese, bacon, lettuce and mayo- mmm good! The ice cream is also really good- we ended with a small vanilla shake. Oh and like other reviews have mentioned, the décor is modern and very nice! 

Things I wasn't too impressed with: The prices were steep- my burger was great but $12.50 is about $3 over priced in my opinion. The bathrooms are also outside- yes you have to walk outside just to use the restroom. And, they are tiny so if there's any kind of line, you're probably going to have to wait outside or just hold it. I also didn't like the limited beer menu- they do have some locals and domestics but not very many choices. Many of the beers are also served in cans- which is kind weird for this style of restaurant. 

At the end of the day, I will totally come back. But, only if I REALLY want a burger and fries (because that's really all they have other than some salads).
The best sushi I've had in all of pittsburgh. We started with the tuna tacos 
Which were a great appetizer and hint of what's to come. Both of us enjoyed sushi, 2rolls a piece and both of mine were specialty rolls. Extremely fresh and creative favors. My favorite item was the Rock N Roll, just fantastic. We will be back and the price was more than fair. Only improvement would be their liquor license is still in the works, BYOB.
As Far as the Franchise goes, this is probably the busiest location of them all. It can get obnoxiously busy around bar time when about 100 drunk people sprint to this place. yes Madisonian's understand why, because Ian's is SPECTACULAR! They practically have any type of pizza that you want. The other thing is that they area reasonably priced too. They may seem like they are a little on the expensive side at $3.40 - $4.50, but I think that is a fair price. The decor and such of this particular location isn't anything special, just some places to eat and get out. Yeah they have the same theme as the Ian's Franchise but it goes un noticed. I'll have to give this location 5 stars mainly because of the employees. They are so kind and make you feel like one of their friends who came over to a barbecue. I have never had a bad experience here because of them, yes that could change but I am hoping not. Well, keep up the excellent work Ian's Pizza - Frances St.
Food is okay, however the service is horrible. I cannot believe how long we had to wait for a refill for my water. There was literally two other couples in the restaurant and we had to wait forever. There was so no staff on the floor for a good 15 minutes. WE HAD TO GET UP AND GET OUR OWN! Our waitress also forgot to ask our order, didn't even come to check on us. Hence, we had no water. Almost wanted to dine and ditch, but being in the service industry myself I did the right thing.
Went to one of our FAV restaurants again last night..but I have a bone to pick with the CHEF. We had a party of 3.Our Bill ws over 100.00  My daughter is 9 months pregnant...due tomorrow...She ordered the New  South  Burger for her Entree - asking to hold the bacon because of Nitrates!!  We asked if there was any way she could have some Fried Pickles on the Burger. We were willing to pay extra for them....The Waitress was hesistant..but The CHEF SAID..ABSOLUTELY  NOT!  Explain This one....He has Fried Pickles back there...they have a Frickle Burger which is a Burger with Fried Pickles...but he would not..Not even for a Pregnant woman who offered to pay for the extra ingredient add the fried pickles....Did I say Pickles..and She is Pregnant...WTH?????
For what it is, I'd say this is almost as good as it gets! Really great menu, fresh ingredients, and a friendly staff.. we had a great breakfast here! We both ordered off the specials menu, I ordered the Heirloom Tomatoes & Buratta Cheese dish, which was amazing! It's served on a grain toast with 2 basted eggs on the side, and although it looks small the ingredients make it filling and very yummy! I also ordered the Morning Meditation juice, and while my husband want a fan (not his taste), I thought it was great! We said we'd have to go back before our vacation ended because there were so many things on the menu thar we wanted to try!
Last night at Escape, the Owner, Jim Tate, created a Willy Wonka themed "TOYS FOR TOTS" event that was such a success!. Three different local Chocolatier's were invited, The Secret Chocolatier, Davidson Chocolates, and Twenty Degree's of Chocolate. They set up beautiful displays of all their yummy chocolates! There was a competition between them. But the whole event was really about the wonderful "Toys for Tots" event. There  was Handsome Strong Marines to collect the toys. Saturday in Charlotte was Small Business Saturday, And the Southend has some wonderful small businesses, Escape Hair and Skin Salon is definitely one of them. They are a trendy full service salon, with a Separate Esthetician Room, and expert colorists and Hair Cutters. They also have a Braid Bar for all the trendy new braids that people are wearing. They also feature local artists in a gallery setting to display their offerings. If you haven't tried them I would highly recommend them..they are a extremely great salon!
Native Arizonan here: we love Mexican food!!  Mexican food is my chicken soup, my default no fail friend. Since I started driving I was eating carne asada burritos around town as my go-to sustenance.

Vaqueros is all the good things I need in a fast Mexican place: dual drive through, large menu, horchata, red or green hot sauce, crispy tacos piled with shredded cheese!!

My favorite is the carne asada burrito- served super hot!  Also the shredded beef tacos are awesome.  I've gotten a combo with an enchilada before and both times the cheese inside was not melted.  Also the chicken taco has a nice garlic flavor but not shredded chicken but diced. 

The drive through girl is super nice!  She recognizes her customers which is appreciated by regulars.
Short and sweet - Had a business dinner here with a client.

Ambiance was nice, and the waiter was very attentive without being intrusive.  Perfect for a business dinner.

I ordered the salmon and client had the scallops. Both were very good.
Sooo we're here after my son's disastrous haircut at the OTHER place that I shall not mention. I had to tell him repeatedly that Tyler was a fab stylist. 
Skeptical but having no choice since I controlled the wheels (LOL), we came to Dre's and when my son saw the beautiful salon, he sang a different tune and became excited to get his haircut. 
The haircut took less than 30 mins which is what you want when cutting the hair of a 7 yr old. And let me tell you "wowza" what a world a difference a vava-boom haircut makes!  
I'm my son's mom so I know I'm already biased (I admit it) but after his haircut, my son's cuteness meter went up 5 notches. Seriously dripping adorable!
And of course Tyler made it look so easy cause he's just that goooood!
Who says boys can't have style!  
All the moms out there, if Tyler can make a boy's hair styling, think about what his cut & style will do for you precious little princesses, yourself and yes, your husbands!!!!
Love!
#style #fab #love
The place itself is really cool, full of positive words and advices on the wall that leads you to their counter, it is a clean and organized restaurant. They have plenty of options to choose from and their price is fair, combo here is worth it! 
However, the one thing you need to be aware of is they offer you the possibility of building your own pizza but according with their portions of each ingredient. This means that if you're like me and love extra cheese or extra anything on your pizza, you will have a hard time here as they have their measurements and won't give you a little extra this or that.
Aside from that they pizza tastes delicious.
If you want good falafel, this is the spot in Madison to get it at. If you want to just eat it at home and heat the pieces in the oven\/pan you can also get them at the Willy Street Co-Op,and they even come with tahini.
Looking for a cool place to go downtown before a class my fiance have to go to. We decided on the Roosevelt because 1. it has beer and 2. we like the idea of a house in the historical district being converted into a restaurant. 

We walked in and were immediately impressed with the decor, and even music playing. We sat at the bar that wasn't crowded at all and looked at the Happy Hour menu. We got some beer that we had never heard of and ordered their Giant Pretzel, and a Chicken Pesto sandwich (wasn't on the menu) and they were both fantastic, we split both but we would have been full if we only got one. 

Overall the beer selection was pretty cool, I only took a quick peek at the wine menu, looked pretty good too but I'm not a wine snob I only like red wine that doesn't hurt the wallet. 

The only thing not giving it 5 stars is that the service was excellent, except that everyone that comes here seems to be very regular so they got caught up in conversation when we were trying to get and pay our tab. It wasn't anything to make you angry but it just took a little too long, especially when you are on a time limit.

I would love to come here again with some friends when we are downtown again. I have already told a bunch of people they need to try it out. It's best to carpool because parking isn't very abundant.
This pretentious restaurant refuses to serve balsamic vinegar. On the other hand, their pepperoncini is great and is probably the only highlight of this restaurant.
Have just been once because we just got a puppy and were having him looked at.  They were very friendly and helpful. The vet seemed very happy to be working with my dog, and gave me a lot of information. It's an older building so it may seem a little run down, but I didn't get any feeling that anything was dirty or unkempt. Very happy to be taking my puppy there again.
LOVE this place. Such a fun place to go for drinks, food, games with friends, family or for a date night. They even have a free photo booth! Food is great quality. I never eat meatloaf but decided to venture outside of my comfort zone and it was really good. Now I order it whenever I go! They also have a great kale salad that's large enough to split. And they're known for their pretzels. 

On wknds they often have live music and on Sundays they offer specials on appetizers (at least during football season). Big fan!
This is a solid choice for good pizza. It's not gourmet but is certainly leaps and bounds above a Domino's or Pizza Hut. They are consistent in both the quality of food and delivery time. We are now loyal customers to this little strip mall gem!

Hint: We like to ask for a little extra cook time on the crust. It makes a big difference!
I enjoyed the coffee and the breakfast. The first time you go it's a little bit hectic, and it might just be a little to trendy for me. I'll probably be back at some point but not in the near future. The prices were fair, it was super busy when we went but we didn't wait long for anything.
I've been coming here for years. They've remodeled the layout to have a nice bar, but searing is available inside and out with tables as well. The menu, however, hasn't changed too much, which is a great thing. Their sandwiches are amazing and hit the spot each time. I suggest the Royal Flush. Beer list is good and they also do slices.
Bullseye for a reason;) 
I will admit this- I'm a proud owner of the Target Red Card.  Free, no fees and it's a debit.  Yes, I balance it;)
I admit right now, right here that I can't just run in for one or a few times.  I'm compelled in perusing those aisles.  Yes, the toys.  I'm a Star Wars follower;)  They carry air hogs!  Don't know it, google please:)  
I gander- every, single, solitary time.
I have the target app.  
I have the cartwheel app.  WHICH is my second favorite app after Yelp.  Instagram comes in a close third;)
They stack coupons, stack on the cartwheel discounts AND then knock off an additional 5 percent with that Target Red card!  Oh, they price match.
That customer service- bullseye;)
The red phones at the end of an aisle, every other aisle along with wipes, a trash can & price checker.  Bullseye hits the mark. Yes, in a target shopper.
If you're a local, it's a drag to have to go to the strip for Chicago deep dish pizza. The parking at Bally's is a bear though still free for now with a Nevada license plate. The self park to restaurant hike is a pain.

It's worth the trip though to get the real deal, but that includes the real wait time. For us on the second visit it was a solid 50 minutes for the pizza to arrive. The couple next to us looked like they were really suffering with an empty table for so long. Hint: eat your salad or appetizer very sloooowly...

Also note that if you eat in the main indoor dining room it is very loud. There is no place for sounds to be absorbed given the concrete floors, absence of window treatments, etc. 

But those things aside, the pizza is heavenly, with an excellent crust that you can happily finish off even if there is no sauce on it. Flakey, buttery goodness. Servers have been friendly, helpful and brought refills of soda without being asked. The kids dig it so we will be back a lot.
Disappointed is the best way to sum up my first visit. Order not ready when promised. Eggplant Parmesan was by far the worst I've ever tried. Missing ingredients like cheese is a big problem for those of us who love Italian food. Portions were extremely small for the money. Pasta was dry. Honestly not many good things to say about this experience.
Camden Sotelo is an awesome property with a friendly, attentive, outstanding staff! The buildings are constructed very well and I love the property layout. Despite being so close to the airport (which is very convenient if you plan to have lots of out-of-town visitors like us) we NEVER hear the airplanes inside our apartment. The property is just big enough but also not so large that it feels like a maize. I believe units were originally designed as condos but during the housing market crash they were transformed into apartments - therefore, the floor plans are very well thought out and practical. The provided underground parking garage and security of the complex are also great. You get TWO parking spots (unheard of in most apartment complexes) which is practical if you plan to have two people with cars living in the unit. We moved from a 2200 square foot home out-of-state to a 1480 square foot unit in Camden Sotelo and have not missed our large house once!

You simply can't beat the location of Camden Sotelo! There's a cute park across the street, a larger park around the corner with a playground and basketball courts, and access to Tempe lake a few blocks away. It's also situated near Papago Mountain\/Park, the Phoenix Zoo, and Desert Botanical Gardens. Across the bridge and you're in the heart of downtown Tempe on Mill Street and it's only a 8-10 minute drive to downtown Scottsdale. It's also situated right off of the 202 highway which is very convenient. 

We were nervous that with this property being so close to ASU, it would be filled with students and a college\/party zone. Although I'm sure there are some students living here, we haven't had any issues and it seems like most residents are young adults\/families. Everyone is friendly and it has a nice community feel to it.

Our experiences with all staff have been great and they are friendly, approachable, and professional. Anytime I've made a request it's been processed within 24-hours. 

We LOVE Camden Sotelo and it's definitely a property to check out!
Came here for a Nostalgia party, the DJ was downright awesome, getting me (the typical Asian dude who really doesn't dance much) to dance the night away. 

The venue itself was alright. It has a long bar that makes it relatively easy to line up against for drinks and high ceilings which give it an open airy feel. 

Bottles of beer were $7-8, well drinks $8. We came early so it ended up being a pretty expensive night .

I'm not a fan of mandatory coat checks, which they have here, especially when you have parts of your group who just want to drop by for a bit. 

The crowd was old(er), which makes sense given the Nostalgia night. I'd definitely come back for Nostalgia nights, 'cause the music was just awesome. Not sure who the DJ was, but kudos to him\/her!
Probably the best place in the Sands Convention Center to grab a quick bite to eat (that is if you don't want anything extremely greasy and salty). Try the panini that is made with tomato, mozzarella, and pesto. Pretty good for food court food.
We have been going here for over 5 years and have had only great experiences with their RMT services. Their staff are professional, experienced, and very friendly. Highly recommend!
I always build my own sushi burrito with same ingredients to compare between different restaurants. Yoshi's is decent but a bit blander compared to other sushi burrito joints. Rice lacks flavor. Nice touch that they scoop up fresh avocado straight from the fruit half. Prefer jaburritos to this place.
It's Panera so you know exactly what to expect food and service-wise. My go-to is the "you pick two" sierra turkey and broccoli cheddar soup. I think I get it every singe time.

This particular restaurant is usually pretty clean and it's conveniently located in a plaza with other essentials - grocery store, bank, etc. This one is far enough from ASU's campus that it doesn't get too swamped with students during the school year. Free wifi and some nice booths and seating areas so you can get work done. 

My last visit here I tried their passion green tea and it was perfectly sweetened. I'll be back for some more of that deliciousness throughout the summer!
I thought this was a beer store.  It is.  But...it's more.  It's a "beer bar".  I guess.  Okay, so what differentiates this place from any other beer store...

Selection
Staff
Perks

So the selection is ridiculous.  If you're a beer lover, you'll be the proverbial kid in the candy store here.  And that can be overwhelming...

Except the staff is extremely knowledgeable and apparently spends a good portion of their day drunk, because how else do you know a bit about every beer in a place that has every beer.  

Perks?  Buy a beer and leave?  Sure.  But why not get a cold beer and watch a movie at the connected Row House Theater?  But Jim, you say, my beer is warm.  No.  No it isn't friend.  They have this magical beer cooling device that takes your warm beer and cools it in a couple minutes.  How have I never heard of this device???

Anyway.  Very cool, fun, trendy place to take a date who likes beer.  Or a buddy who likes beer.  Or really anyone who likes beer.*

*This places is not ideal for someone who does not like beer.
A very quaint place to go for a treat  the service is excellent. Plenty of flavors and serving sizes to choose from. I'll try different flavors but stick with trying them in a waffle cone. So far chocolate with peanut butter and pistachio are my top faves.
