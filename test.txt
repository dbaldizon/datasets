I dont recommend this lady at all, DON'T waist your time she is so rud, she has an attitude of a bulldog, I dont know how is she in business, my assitant bought a mani and pedi in groupon for my birthday so I got there on time, she told me on the ph the business name is NBN salon but theres nothing to show that around the building, the name on the side window is Nails Studio,  theres 4 suites and the rings dont have any tags (kind of hard to find it) so i finally made it in and with the most meaning attitude you can imagine she told me is going to be 1.5 hrs wait take it leave it,  you can reschedule I was thinking why is she talking like that... without looking at me at all and how can she play with people's time like that, I could be at my sons soccer game, so I respectfully and almost afraid of her response I said I will reschedule but next time you need to let me know  the exact time I can be seen because I'm on a schedule, OMG it was like I told her some racist comment, she stopped doing her clients nails, (she finally look at me and just picture a mean black lady with an ugly attitude) she started to go on and on  .... I was terrorized it is amazing how she welcomes new clients, I usually don't do reviews but I hope if your reading this I'll save you from having a disturbing experience, this is the worse experience I've had in my life. 1 start is too much.
We are so pleased that we tried Greulich's! My husband took my Nissan for a brake inspection at another shop a week ago. The put a brake kit on the right rear wheel; however, after that we had a strange noise coming from that area. My husband took it over to Greulich's and it was found that the previous shop left a spring in there which was rubbing and making the noise. Scott Bowsher, assistant manager, also drove him home while the car was being checked. And...there was no charge! We will be back!
I love coming here and sitting in the patio. There is an opening to the bar where you can order drinks and I like this much more as opposed to waiting for a server to bring you drinks and check in on you. 

To be honest I have only tried their wings and fries here and I was very satisfied. 

Drinks are decently priced, making it a good place for a quick bite with a drink.
Peculiar Rabbit...Not Peculiar at all...More like Incredible Rabbit!  My first experience with this establishment and wow I was blown over. Walked in and it is a very interesting looking building, there is a roof top seating area also but it was 36 degrees here last night and not the time to sit outside. Our waiter approached us right away and informed us that wine by the bottle under 60.00 was half price and to our surprise they had Klinker Brick Petite Syrah! 13 bucks, half price that is a great deal! We looked over the menu and decided that we would have all appetizers. They all sounded so good we had a hard time deciding.  Our first order was for Devils on Horseback, normally it s Bacon wrapped dates but this was  Figs wrapped with Bacon and stuffed with Goat Cheese..(Is your mouth watering yet) served with a side of Arugula salad with tiny beets chopped up on it ...Wonderful! Our Next appetizer was the Duck Duck Mousse. A gorgeous plate with a Duck Mousse served in a little cup with sliced apple and two kinds of pickles, a Duck Confit salad with a pear Marmalade and sexy little pieces of Brioche buttered and sliced for you to spread the lusciousness on...It was really really good! (I think my favorite of all) Our third app was the Asparagus and Egg, It was really good smoked Asparagus with a poached egg over Pepperonota sweet peppers. And our last tidbit was the Lamb Lollipops, two very meaty ground lamb lollipops over a bed of hummus. The Lamb was incredible, grilled and  succulent. It was served with plain flatbread. The hummus was not so great but the lamb made up for it. Like I said..Peculiar , no, Incredible yes..I will be going back soon!
Love it. Beautiful atmosphere, great customer service and fresh food. A little pricey but worth it for a fun evening out. My only complaint is that they are closed both Sundays and Mondays--seems a little excessive but that's just me. I highly recommend the cheese enchiladas with green sauce. To all my veggies out there, never fear! Their beans are safe for us :) For many years we have been and will continue to be frequent customers.
The service at this restaurant was horrible! We sat at our tables with our menus closed for 15 minutes before having to ask for a server. Even after another 5 minutes, a manager showed up, and we still didn't have a server. 

And the kicker was that the restaurant was empty!! Completely disappointing. Go to 360!
Wow - did my buttons get pushed on my last visit.  Our same group of 4 was really looking forward to another amazing experience....I'm pretty sure I ruined that.  

I'm a vegetarian of over 20 years.  Menus and restaurant choices have come a long way since then, which allows me to find something to eat other than a salad when I go out.  Back to Fix.  We all ordered the same items....Kobe burgers, tomato soup, and adult mac and cheese sticks.  Here's where things went bad.....

I get through half of a mac and cheese stick and feel something funny in my mouth.  Something not mac-y and not cheese-y.  I pull it out of my mouth and see - gasp - MEAT!  WHAT!?!??!!  Fiance confirmed.  It's MEAT.  

When the waitress came over, I asked her if there was bacon in the mac and cheese sticks.  She says "No, it's prosciutto, why?  You don't eat pork?"  I told her NO, I'm a VEGETARIAN, and the menu did not list pork as an ingredient and you did not tell me when I ordered that pork is an ingredient.  I had to pull out the piece of pork from my MOUTH before I realized it was an ingredient.  She replies with an "I know, they really should list it on the menu."  And she walks away.  

Hello!??!?!?!  I was polite about it but firmly expressed that I was not happy.  No offer to get my something else, no offer to comp them, nothing.  I would have at least liked some effin' donuts.  Geez.

I just couldn't believe the any upscale restaurant in this day and age would have the audacity to not list an ingredient like MEAT.  It's so frustrating. 

Okay, I'm climbing off the soapbox now.  Good night.
We went look for a place to eat after church this afternoon and glad we stumbled upon this spot!! No wait. Such a cool ambience. I would love to come back during the evening while a band is playing and check out the scene then. The food was great!! We came with a party of 10 and everyone's food was perfect. I got the fish and chips, I have never had fish battered the way they did it but it is my new favorite! And the fries are out of the world good! I wish I knew my servers name cause he was super sweet! We will be back for sure!! Keep up the awesome job!
Huge amount of space and clean facilities--great for big conventions. Parking is only $3 and pretty big parking lots on top of that! It's RIGHT off the highway which is so convenient!
Exec Summary: Awesome fish, and OK chips. 

Things to try: um... the fish? 

Price: About $10 + tax and tip

My friends keep telling me about this place, and I finally managed to try it out, and I'm glad I did!

The biggest factors for good fish and chips are: the fish, the batter, and the amount of grease. That's a bit of a no brainer.

Olde York has a simple recipe, with good, flaky fish, a crispy batter, and most importantly, that is not too greasy.   It's fish and chips, it's obviously not healthy, but nobody likes a oily grease soaked piece of fish! Olde York delivers here with good frying techniques to keep the batter crisp.

The chips were ok, nothing spectacular. 

Next time, I'll have to try the onion rings!
I was pleasantly surprised that they serve dimsum here after changing owners. And the dimsum was really good. I believe if you come for early bird special that all dishes are $2.99. My favourite dimsum dish is siu mai and they were delicious here. Really recommend checking them out!
You know I have stayed at over 120 DIFFERENT hotels over the past 4 years. That is 30 new ones a year! More than a different one every 2 weeks! 

Whew, so I forgot that I stayed at this one before! 

I got a great summer rate, $99, for a good size room on the 18 floor. 

When it is 115 degrees in downtown Phoenix, where this hotel is situated, it is like a science fiction movie where everyone in the middle of downtown is gone. Nobody walking the streets. Everyone left town. 

Ergo, the great rate, whereas in the winter, the same room may go for $250. 

In summertime, there is only one person working the registration desk. They have kiosk check-in stations, and she shows you how to do it. You can check out the same way. 

Valet parking ($27) is not automated, however, and tips are still expected. 

Free WiFi if you are a Hyatt Gold Member.

PS - best thing about this hotel is that they put your soap and shampoo, both new, IN your shower, on the little platform. Makes sense, doesn't it?

Do you know how many times I stepped out of the shower soaking wet, having to reach for the soap and\/or shampoo, sitting on one of those little cutesy trays near the sink? 

Practically every time!  You too?
This bank is better than the one located on green valley but they are seriously understaffed. Theres a line of 10 people and only two tellers. Like i dont have a day booked with clients? Please get more tellers.
I love how this place offers tons of healthy options especially for vegans and vegetarian. On the downside though the menu is pretty extensive so it's a good idea to check out the menu before you go inside because it's healthy "fast" food. On a positive note the staff is very friendly and helpful. My salad was pretty good
Ambiance de malade mentale...surtout pour la St-Pat...allez-y vous allez vous y amuser. Le band est super
Perhaps the best and most beautiful patio in town, however the food is only so so. Definitely worth visiting on a nice day. I recommend bringing wine, beer or sake, and maybe some fresh chillies, to enhance your meal. For take out, I'd go elsewhere.
There's not much better than a massage and an adjustment. The staff and dr.'s at MAXHEALTH are Amazing!!!!
We brought a stray kitten here to get her all fixed up so she could be adopted. She received her spay, testing and all shots for $120...that is a steal. I was surprised at how friendly the staff was and they made sure to answer any questions I had. Maeby (the kitten) has healed up well and is in the clear to be adopted. It is a bit drab and even a little depressing but their money goes to providing affordable pet care, not decorating. I will continue to bring my pets to their normal vet but if you're in a pinch and wanting to save a lot of money on these necessary vet trips, this is the place to go.
This is an interesting place. Most of it is a large, eclectically decorated diner and there is also a decent sized lounge in the back. There is a large parking lot out front and even more space out back. This place gets crazy busy so plan ahead. There is a ton of seating, and they turn tables fairly quickly but there is often still a wait. If you come during any peak meal hours be prepared to wait.

The dining area is a series of large booths. There are neon lights all over and a mirrored tile ceiling, much like a disco ball. There are also a ton of plants scattered through out the diner.

I ordered the Joe's San Francisco Special without spinach. It is a combination of scrambled eggs, pork sausage, ground beef and onion served on a bed of crispy hash browns with a cheese sauce. As with all of their meals you get a large portion. You will not leave hungry. The flavors all combined nicely as did the textures. I was quite happy with my choice.

Overall the service was good, the food was good, the portions are larger and it is affordable. The only issue is the crowds. It is quite popular, but also worth it.
Solid soup place...has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it...you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back...usually closes the sliding window so you can't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup. Also seems to sell a selection of Jamaican movies in DVD from a glass case...sort of random.

Generous with the veggies, less so with dumplings, but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price. I wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup...would be a nice, easy add-on. But this place is what it is and doesn't bother with the bells and whistles. Really deserves a 3.5 stars. The red bean is my fav by far.
I fell in love with Culver's when I went in Wisconsin back in 2007. At the time, I had only tried the custard, which is absolutely divine! I went there a few times until I had to return home to Arizona. After a few years of patiently waiting, I found out Culver's was coming to Mesa! I was elated!!! Since then, I have expanded my pallete to their burgers, wraps and sides. I still think the custard is what makes this place special but their other food is good too. I love the fact that they have flavor of the day for custards. Totally amazing place and I would recommend to anyone who likes burgers, fries and custard.
I'm not giving this 1 star because their food is bad, because it's not. I'm giving them 1 star because, for the 3rd time, they have completely screwed my order up. It's 2:02pm, I ordered my pizza at 11:20am (almost 3 hours ago). My pizza is still "on its way" as it has been since the first time I called at 12:30. They have given me so many excuses, but unfortunately, I ordered pizza, not BS. 

I spoke with their manager, he offered me 50% off, but I still don't think that 50% is any good. I was hungry when I ordered, but now, due to the length of time it takes them to deliver, I already ate, and frankly, I don't want the pizza anymore. 

The sad part is, Mama Mia's pizza is amazingly good. It's their management that is terrible. I used to work at a pizza shop when I was younger, and we never would have let even an hour go by if someone was waiting on some food (let alone 3 hours). I normally order from Mama Mia's once or twice a week, and it usually takes them about an hour to deliver, which is fine. This is the 3rd time they've screwed up. Last time, they LITERALLY DID NOT CUT MY PIZZA. So, they basically delivered a huge pizza that we had to tear apart with our hands (we're bachelors, what can I say).

I will never order from them again, ever. I WAS a huge fan until now.
Expensive yes, but consistently good. Attention paid to the drinks and food. When a restaurant prepares an excellent salad then you know they care about the quality. Great for a special occasion or business dinner.
This is the best tasting pizza in all of Arizona. I'm from NY and I was afraid I'd never find NY tasting pizza again and after watching Breaking Bad realized there is a Venezia's by me. I tried it and was blown away. Keep it up!
I've loved this place since it was in Ambridge & was so happy when they opened in the South Hills!! I think the owners are innovative, knowledgable, and have trained their baristas well. I ordered an extra dry cappuccino and the barista served me the perfect drink! Their syrups are house made, which I love, minus the sugar free ones. 

Please bring those amazing gluten free cookies that you sell in Beaver County down to Castle Shannon!!
Yes!!!  Finally a hotel stay that I could actually relax and enjoy myself. From the moment we arrived we were welcomed with warm smiles and outstanding customer service. Our room was clean and updated which made us feel right at home. Breakfast was delicious. I would recommend this location to all my family members and friends.
Love it!!! Layne thank you for you for recommendations!!!! You were pleasant, upbeat, and fun! We got the repeat necessities and you guided us into amazeaballs additions!!!
The sushi here is decently priced. Fish here is fresh and really good, but i much prefer their sashimi than sushi. Their special sushi rolls tend to have the same cheese\/mayo sauce all over and can overpower any delicate fish. 

Also the rolls are tightly packed and never fell apart! They have a good ratio of rice to fish and other ingredients. The wasabi here isn't fresh though, most likely powder. Definitely get the following dishes: 
-Salmon\/Tuna pressed sushi
-Sashimi
-Rainbow star + energy special roll. 

Don't get the lobster king and island roll as the lobster pieces were tiny, and that cheese mayo sauce was too overpowering,
Wonderful place for dessert, the owners of the store was so nice. The ice cream was served pretty quick, and I was very happy with what I got.
very good Burger and fries. Burgers and fries made to order. they give you alotta fries! but its about 10-12 buck to get burger fries and drink. way better than any fast food burger including in and out. good stuff a must stop if you like burgers and fries! and its on mill so no free or easy parking on weekdays
Went in to try and make ends meet for bills, Christian went out of his way to make sure that i was satisfied with my visit
Absolutely disgusting customer service. I returned my car 23 Oct after renting for a couple of days and was told mt $500 deposit would be returned to me in 5 - 10 days. I phoned on 15 Nov to say I still did not have my deposit returned to me and Anita who was exceptionally rude said I must call my bank to sort it out. I said I had already called and they had said the funds had not been released. Every time I tried to talk she talked over me and then she eventually just put me on hold. I held on for 10 minutes because I knew she was hoping that I would just put down the phone. When she answered again I could hear that she was surprised that I was still there. I then said that I was in the middle of talking to her when she put me on hold and she said "I got busy". She then told me to phone my bank and put the phone down on me. DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY - absolutely horrendous experience and still don't have my $500 back.
The most beautiful and inspirational place to practice in the whole Valley, if not the whole state! The owners are warm and embracing. The facilities are unmatched. And the whole experience of practicing at Yoga Deva is transcendent. Highly recommended
J'aime bien ce petit resto. Je ne dis pas que c'est le meilleur, mais il a beaucoup a offrir pour les petits budgets. La soupe est correct, non pas mauvaise, mais pas la meilleur de Montréal. Par contre, les grillades et les sautés, j'adore! Plusieurs choix à moins de 10$ et aussi plusieurs choix offert en combo. Je ne conseille pas vraiment d'y aller en groupe...ce n'est pas un jolie endroit. Mais plutôt commander ou bien y aller manger en vitesse! 

Essayez le sauté de fruit de mer sur nouilles croustillantes...EXCELLENT!
First time meeting Rags and eating his delicious chicken and waffles!! But it will not be the last!! Home cooking at its best with some great conversation!! Call a head to order the fried pork chop sandwich!!
Gorgeous setting, friendly people, and the best specialty drinks I've ever had!  No syrups, no added sugar...just liquor deliciousness!

Oh, and the appetizers looked pretty good too!
1st time at MGM Grand in town for my 3 day Bachelor Party MUAHAHAHAHAHAH!!! 

The rooms are clean and remodeled - could use a DVD player though. Our 2 queen suite had a sectional sitting area with flat screen. 2nd flat screen in front of beds.. About 700 sq ft pretty nice (not the ritz but not bad at all).

$56 to check out @ 6pm. Room service was reasonably priced and faster service than dining in the restaurants.

Plenty of towels (ask any housekeeping member for towels when you see them walking down the halls.)

Never had any complaints, played our beats all day and night (of course we self monitored) you best believe we got rowdy with guests in and out the room 24\/7...ALL GOOD!

Went to free pool instead of Wet Republic. Plenty of folks had the same idea, everybody was having fun! Nothing but cool peeps, positive vibe, everyone flirting and kicking it just looking for a good time.

Great party hotel definitely recommend!
This is what my insurance provided to me and its 5 mins away from .. all the staff are nice to me ! I really love coming to this place they are gentle .. theres only one assistant that irritates me i forgot her name .. she was doing my root canal .. idk if she is trying to impress the dr. Coz my mouth is small cant get the xray right but im pushing down any further and i feel like i wanna throw up .. smh .. but i did it anyways smh .. but other than that i love this place they are fast with there works!  They do stuff like donating so you can save money out of your bill !
Fave place for Japanese Cheesecake.  Great texture and nice flavour. So glad that they are opening a few locations like STC and Yonge and Sheppard.
Great neighborhood find. Good beer list and the food is good as well. Will definitely come back as the price for happy hour was great!
Came here for a lunch because we were drawn in by the veggie options. The food was disappointing but the service and gorgeous rooftop patio made it an overall lovely experience. 

Highlight if the visit was how wonderful all of the staff was about the twin five year old boys dining with us. They offered to bring fresh buns when the burger "hat" came slathered in mayo and were very sweet and patient taking their orders. 

The food was yummy and i was glad for the variety of options on the menu but nothing was super memorable. I do want to come back to try their brunch which i've heard great things about!
Was a regular here, but never felt like I was treated like one. I had a bad experience when someone painted my nails over 4 coats, so they didnt dry in over an hour and I had to go back to get them repainted. That was fine, and I kept going back until the last time. I got my nails done and left with a bloody pinky finger and half decent nails, with no apology for the cut that was clearly bleeding. To be honest, the young woman who works there is attentive and way better than anyone else, which is why she is always booked with appointments. The older man is nice, but he watches tv the whole time he does nails and I never leave satisfied. I just couldnt keep paying money to an establishment that never seemed to care. I wouldnt recommend this place to a friend.
Leah did a great job!  I was in the middle of remodeling my home, and needed extra help.  Leah was there to lend a hand.  Thanks so much!
Let me start by saying I despise the strip.  I am all about friendly dealers, friendly and prompt cocktail servers, and cheap gambling.  If you're like me, this is the place for you.  Their dealers know all the locals by name, and treat the out-of-towners with the same respect.  It's a tiny joint with only 3 tables, so cocktails are offered regularly.  I think my friend downed about a dozen drinks in just under an hour.  He chatted with all the staff (he's a talker) and had as much fun as I.  The place isn't much to look at, but who cares.  Their restaurant is yummy and cheap.  I think the restaurant could use a facelift.  The bathrooms appeared to be redone nicely and were kept clean.  I approve!  I went back 3 times while staying in vegas fri-sat.  Goodbye strip!  Goodbye Freemont Street!  The hotel elevators look little creepy, I don't know that I would stay here.
Tim has been watching my dog since he was about 2 months old. Recently, my dog got a little sick and I had no idea what to do or what was wrong. Tim totally walked me through the process and helped guide me through what to expect when your dog isn't feeling well. He even offered to look through all the labels on my dog's food and treats to look for any ingredients that could cause allergies. He called me with updates on my dog while I was at work, since he knew how nervous I was. This is my first dog so knowing that I have Tim and APC to guide me and communicate with me, is a huge relief. The amazing part of this story is that I really didn't feel like a burden to Tim. I know how much he cares about my dog and that he would show any of his clients this much compassion.

I really can't say enough positive things about the company. It's hard to trust someone with your pets, but I really do trust Tim and Absolute Pet Care!
Love this place- there's a vibe here that's just fun and vibrant.  And I am addicted to their bruschetta and their antipasto plate.  
How good is this place?  Some days, I get physical cravings for their bruschetta and I just have to have some- or when I am having a bad day- you guessed it- having some of their bruschettas makes me feel better.
I've had bruschetta at other restaurants but none compared to the ones from Postino.  I think when they spread that topping on those yummy bread, they are thinking good cheer and loving thoughts- how else can you explain the addictive qualities of toppings placed on top of pieces of bread?
Love this place and I' would go back again and again.
I stopped in here for lunch today and as usual the food was good. I ordered a yellow chicken curry dish, which came with rice and a salad and a soup. I would give this place more stars, but the service was not up to par. I'm not sure if the food server was tired, or just did not want to work, but whatever the reason, she should have stayed home. At first I thought it was just my table, but then I noticed that other customers were having problems with her as well, for example she kept forgetting to bring forks to one table.
I love a great wine happy hour....while walking from the West Side Market I came along this place because I was looking for somewhere to chill and relax...walked in and immediately the guy said hello and welcomed me in..."we have happy hour going on with a great selection of wines"...my kinda place. Great lounge music too! I'm liking Cleveland thus far on my 1 at visit here!
When I found out I was having a baby, one of my top priorities was finding suitable childcare. I knew I would be going back to work and wanted to have arrangements made well in advance. Who would've thought quality daycare comes with applications and long waitlists?

5 months before I was due, I started researching and scheduling tours. I had heard nothing but stellar things about Montessori. That combined with Villa's infant room, almost unheard of at these schools, was an immediate draw for me.

I don't want to bore you with the details but after several postponements of our tour, unresponsiveness from staff members, and clear internal miscommunications, we never even got to see the facility. I had to go out of my way to try and establish a relationship. After several attempts, I wrote an email advising we would not be pursuing childcare at their facility. The director went above and beyond to contact me and asked if we could set up a phone call. I agreed but did not receive a call at the scheduled time -- icing on the cake. 

I experienced a huge lack of professionalism with Villa that I'm not willing to risk translating into something more serious in care of my LO.
Coming from fitchburg and comparing the two locations, I am pleased with BOTH. I am glad that each location has their own feel and they aren't quite the same nor are the too far apart. Great place to do some homework and hang out with friends, a little more college-student friendly this one. A little more going on rather than the more "elegant" atmosphere of the fitchburg location. Staff is a little nicer there as well.
Another option for desert in DTS. They have excellent gelato and plenty of flavors to choose from. They also have non-dairy options, which were also excellent. We tried the salted coconut mango, passion fruit, and the chocolate sorbet. They were all excellent. I recommend you stop by and try this place. You won't be disappointed.
Just take my money... I can't seem to leave Costco for under $100. LOL

Costco seriously has everything you could possibly need... High quality food, cheap gas, wine, a great bakery, frozen foods for days, canned goods, caskets (WTF), tires, home goods, furniture, electronics, an optometrist, pharmacy, and so on and so on... It's the only place on Earth (that I know of) that you can walk out with a pair of Hudson jeans, big ass ribeye steaks, and a new set of tires for your car in one trip. 

Pro tip: You do not need a Costco membership to use the pharmacy.
Came here again for a business dinner. We ordered the "Daughter" all in one menu (#3), which is Beef, Chicken and Pork, all marinated. 
It came with romaine salad first, and then a bunch of banchan dishes on the side. We also had 2 Jinro Soju (they only have 1 choice).

Food was solid and the service from Eunice was very good. She had great timing, handling other tables, but coming back right on time to do all of our cooking for us, from starting a meat, to turning it over, to serving it to us. 

We had a nice table against the back wall, so we could talk business without a lot of noise, and with Eunice's professional timing, not any interuptions, either. 

We had plenty of food for 3 grown men, and with the Soju, the total was $105 before tip.
Small location, with some seating out front. Hard to get into and place order and wait to receive it. Everyone ends up smooshed together and waiting and they certainly take their time. 
I asked if they did flavoured lattes (ex. caramel latte). Nope, they do what they list on their menu. No more. I ordered a regular latte. Nothing special. I have tried a few food items here and nothing was particularly good. I'd take a pass. There are WAY better coffee shops in the mall.
Ceux qui aiment le gin vont être comblé. Ils ont plusieurs choix. Demander au serveur de vous aider sur votre choix. Le service est bien. Le bar aussi. Beau petit bar de quartier :).
Excellent sushi!!

This place is located across from the Hard Rock in the CVS Plaza. It is a cool place with a nice atmosphere as far as sushi places go.

It is not an AYCE place and it will cost you quite a bit of cash if you eat like you are at an AYCE place, but the sushi is excellent and the staff is very friendly. I use to get sushi to-go from here all the time when I worked in the area.

Highly recommend!
The "Haizley's Hot Link Sandwich" is wonderful. It has a lot of flavor and is a treat for your taste buds. But it is also very messy!

I keep thinking I am going to branch out and try something new but I just can't resist it!
I have only been to the location in Summerlin on Fort Apache, but I heard they also have a location in Henderson. The location in Summerlin is close to my house, so it makes it easy to go grab a healthy breakfast when I don't feel like cooking. 

Mimi's Cafe has two dining areas, a counter you can eat at, and they also have outside seating. The place always appears to be very clean and the staff is very friendly. I have never had an issue with my food or with the service in the seven years I have been going here.

Mimi's Cafe is a great place for a healthy breakfast. They make egg white omelette's and they have steel cut oats. They have fresh blueberries for your oats too. They also have great steak and eggs. It's not on the menu anymore, but if you ask, they will make it for you.

I have never been here for dinner, but I would bet it as just as good as there breakfast menu.

I highly recommend Mimi's.
I would probably only go here for a piercing (South Side or Oakland locations).  I think the staff is knowledgeable, and extremely clean.  I have been there a few times
Great food. Best orange chicken around. Crispy and sweet. The texture of the food is the best part of this place. It's not that nasty, soggy stuff you get at other asian restaurants.
I've eaten here several times as I work in the area.

As usual for a food court area in a casino it's always very loud here. The line is usually very long as well.

I've never tried Popeyes prior to this place opening and can say after several visits that if this is typical of all Popeyes Chicken I'm not a big fan of their food.
No wait for Saturday brunch.  It was actually quite empty inside and there were even some seats on the patio.  Plentiful parking in the back lot shared with Durant's.  Got the french toast with maple syrup.  It was really good, but the sausage was barely lukewarm, bordering on cold.  Tasty enough, but would've been fantastic served sizzling hot.  Service was fine.  Water glass was kept filled.  Spent a little over $10 before tip.
This is a really cute place to grab a bite. It's my go to spot for a good meal. The service is always friendly and helpful. The outside patio is really cute and the inside is cozy as well. The food is yummy and there are good portions. I always recommend this restaurant to folks looking for a good meal!
This is still a somewhat newer walmart. The staff here is much better than the store on Craig and mlk.
I came in today to get my husband a new phone, since he's still rockin' the Razor circa 1999 (and pay as you go no less!!).  I did my research and found out he was interested in the Samsung Moment with Google and we could add a data plan on to mine.  Sweeeeeet.

Maybe 30 minutes later I was all set, and the two men working were super friendly and helpful.  You could tell that they do whatever they can to make the customer happy.  Definitely check them out if you're in need of Sprint help!
Went there with a friend to get pedicures. No complaint about the staff: nice and friendly people  but the owner did not even acknowledge our presence borderline rude and did not even answer my friend's questions. Also, there was only 1 lamp which the ladies had to share to do proper pedi, the stones were not hot so had to paint the nails first. No biggie but overall, I've had better pedi for the same price.
My Wife and I attended yesterday as we had been told by friends about this new restaurant. I have to say that they did a beautiful job remodeling the place. It is a beautiful layout with great views of the pond inside the Boardwalk. We were greeted quickly and had our choice of where we wanted to sit. I had the French Toast Combo that came with an Egg cooked any way and a Breakfast meat of your choice. I chose Bacon of course. The Bacon was very flavorful and crispy, my egg was cooked a perfect over medium and the French Toast was incredible. My Wife had the Eggs Benedict and again, absolutely delicious. The Eggs were poached perfectly and the Hollandaise sauce was on point. She also had Potatoes with hers and they were so good that I about ate half of them and will definitely order those next time. The staff was very friendly from the time we walked in to the time we walked out. Drinks were always refilled and we even left with to go drinks. There was a altercation of some sort in the Kitchen that was loud and then we saw someone leaving out the front door with the Manager pointing at the door for him to leave. The Manager instantly apologized to the whole restaurant, then came to our table and introduced himself (I believe Tim was his name) and explained an employee was terminated and apologized for the noise and the interruption that caused in our dining experience and applied a discount for us. It didn't bother us but we were impressed none the less. We will be going back without a doubt. My only suggestion is to get a bigger sign so you can see the restaurant from the parking lot, it can be hard to spot.
I've been here twice, and have had great food and a-plus service both times.  I love that they're open 24\/7, too!  It's hard to find good non-fast-food restaurants with those hours, so this place is a go-to in that department, as well.  I can't remember what I had the first time I came here, but most recently I had their ravioli - yum!  Thanks, Bootlegger!
Looking for something fun and different? If your significant other is a gamer and you're looking to win major brownie points, come here! I definitely got an excited, huge smile from the hubby when I surprised him and brought him here for Father's Day!! 

Even with the sign "Modern Round," my husband was a little unsure what to expect and exactly what we were walking into. At first he thought it was a shooting range, not a virtual one. He LOVES gaming and since he doesn't get a chance to much these days, this was the perfect gift. 

Upon entering, we were immediately struck by the unique, modern, upscale decor. The hostess showed us to our lounge carrying the virtual guns in a locked metal box with an attached handcuff - a nice touch that kicked off our unique, upscale experience. All the staff were super friendly, attentive and willing to take our "Bonnie and Clyde" pics! 

Whoever thought of this concept is brilliant. Think fancy, adult virtual shooting lounge meets restaurant\/bar. Love that you get your own lounge, server, that the food and drinks are actually yummy...and there aren't a ton of kids running around (unlike most gaming spots). 

Fun place to come to with a group so that you can split the cost of the hourly rental. Also a nice place to enjoy as a couple so that you can get more playing time!

So much fun - we'll definitely be back soon!
Still five stars. Still the best waxing experience I've ever had, similar to the other times with Sheena. I am moving and would love to take her with me!! The sensitive areas of waxing are treated with care: Sheena tells you to breathe out as she's pulling the strip and immediately applied pressure to lessen the pain. She's got great conversational skills which help distract from the pain as well... But she's so experienced there isn't much pain, to be honest. 

Some folks complain about them not leaving the room as you undress, but honestly, it's not like they are staring at you. And they see probably 20 people a day, it's not that big of a deal. 

The area is sterilized in front of you, no double dipping in the wax bucket, and you are treated with their magic lotion before and after waxing. 

Can't say enough good things about this location or Sheena!
I love everything about this salon and really they have a forever client in me--unless I move out-of-state then I can't see getting my hair done elsewhere.  I've been a client for a little over a year and don't trust my hair to anyone else.  This came after years of searching for someone I trusted with my hair.  

I found Salon Bernabo because they use the Davine's line of hair color and shampoo.  For anyone that's interested (obsessed?) with hair color and natural products I would recommend this particular line.  It's not the generic Wella, etc brands that you find in ever other salon.  It's better, sustainable, etc.  Needless to say, these products aren't available at ever salon and the Pittsburgh area only has three salons that offer Davines.  

If you're looking for a super-posh, super trendy salon, you're better off going to Shadyside.  If you're looking for superior skill, attentiveness, high quality, I would definately try Salon Bernabo.  I see the same stylist each time, but the cuts I see leaving from the other stylists are top notch.

Next comes the ability of the stylist to provide some guidance on "what to do" with your hair.  I really love that I have a stylist that is able to guide me when some of my ideas won't work but provide me change.  Hair is really important to me and after years of searching I've found a great place.  I could not be happier and really look forward to getting my hair done here.  

Finally I have to give praises to the owner.  I'm not his client but he manages to say hello, compliment, and be very pleasant.  That's really impressive to me.  I find that welcoming and humble.
Small family restaurant, Fish was really fresh! All the cooks were Japanese, that's something to account for! I would definitely recommend this place! There is a little grocery shop on the side with a wide variety of imported Japanese products. Service was quick
The parking lot is a clusterfuck.

The entrance to this location always smells like spoiled milk. 

They usually have everything except what I am looking for and\/or I just can't find it because it is not placed with similar things. Like when I went looking for organic hot cocoa mix...a week later I found it, not with the other hot cocoa mixes, but very randomly on it's own display at the end of the Asian foods isle. Gnocci? Not with the frozen Italian things, but with the other frozen Italian things...

And then when I finally find that one item that I desperately wanted enough to look for it here, I face the crazy check out lines where one has plenty of time to analyze a disturbing cross-section of consumer society, at which point I often re-think my desire for the superfluous item in hand, set it down and swear to never return to this store again.
As a local one of the reasons I enjoy going to The Strip is for the high roller!  They also provide a discount for locals.
We're visiting Vegas from CA and went here for dinner with friends.  We knew we got a brand new waiter, because another waiter was shadowing him, so we were like....here we go....this should be interesting!  Wrong!  This kid "Justin" was GREAT!!!!!  Good hire Brio!  Awesome food! Awesome service!  We'll be back!
It's honestly the best gourmet hotdog in Vegas! I was a little lost when I came in but was quickly helped by a very friendly lady who explained me the different buns and what a few of the ingredients were. We ordered 4 dogs, being two wrapped bacon dogs; one house dog; and one elote dog without chili powder, and also garlic fries along with drinks. 
The food came out pretty fast and OH MY GOD! I felt like I was in hot dog heaven! :) Everything was perfect and very, very tasty! 
We were constantly checked on by one of the ladies which just made the whole experience better.

As for the place itself, it's s really cool place with lots of murals and the colors along with the decoration were very harmonious. The only one thing I didn't like much was the bathroom because it was a little too dark. I saw a baby changing station, which was great, but in a kinda dark place I think it would be a little uncomfortable to change a baby. 
Still, it's a must try if you like gourmet hotdogs!
Ugh I don't know what they did but the saimin broth was horrible.  Truly awful, bland, muddy, and tasteless.  It was so bad.

Portuguese sausage musubi was very oily but edible.  Good spice.

The male Asian cashier pretty much forced a tip through the credit card machine, as he handed it to me with three options displayed, none of which were 0.

Cashier was later watching tv on his phone at the register.

Soy sauce was in re-used plastic bottles which was gross.

I won't go back, and am now actively discouraging people from going here.
I never write reviews but I felt compelled to write one for Dr. Jones office. I hate going to the Gynecologist and have had trouble finding an office that doesn't make you wait weeks or months for an appointment and that has a good doctor. I had my first visit with Dr. Jones today, he was wonderful and so was the staff. They were accommodating, took me back quickly, and were very thorough. Blanca was awesome. :)
Quand je suis allée cet été, la terasse était ouverte. Un beau menu de bières sur un tableau noir. J'ai commandé pour manger des ailes de canard...miam délicieux. Cette journée là, un mardi, il y avait une soirée d'humour. Je ne sais pas s'il y avait un manque de staff mais au début la serveuse est venu quand même souvent et ensuite, on m'a oublié :( Ça a pris tellement de temps que j'aurais pu partir sans payer...mais comme je suis honnête, je suis rentrée à l'intérieur. La section où il n'y avait pas de soirée d'humour n'était pas occupé...je crois simplement qu'ils ont oublié qu'il y avait des clients sur la terrasse. Bref...j'y retournerai certainement pour des bières!!
This is the second time I have made a purchase from this location and was very happy...again. The service inside the store was very professional and gave input when needed. The delivery process was simple and quick. Would definitely return.
Been here at least a dozen times, great fish, awesome vegetarian moussaka, Scott plays great music, the place has a warm family vibe. Love it.
Love this place! It never disappoints. The chicken shawarma and the falafel pita are my favorites.
Started with the guacamole last night, which was delightful. Lots of flavor and crunchy texture from the onions and cilantro. Ordered a strawberry fresca and it delighted my taste buds. I didn't even feel bad drinking it because it is just pure yummy juice....no artificial colors or flavors...just strawberry goodness over ice! 
For my entree, I ordered a salad. I can't remember the name now, but I did take a photo to add to my review of how perfect it looked when it arrived. It tasted as good as it looked. I added chicken to it, which was too seasoned for my taste, but the rest of the salad was killer. So many unique flavors combining together that each bite tasted better than the last. The dressing came on the side and I didn't even use it! That should tell you how natural packed the salad was with flavor. This will be my go to salad for sure. I'll update my review next time with the name of it. (Yelper fail) 
The manager came over to check on us multiple times and was so eager to make sure our experience was on point. One of the most involved, and active upper management people I have come across in all my years of dining out. He really made us feel like we were old friends of his, eating at his personal restaurant. Lots of pride in what he does, and what his restaurant serves. HE is what set my review over the top and puts Joyride at a solid 5. I will also figure out the managers name and update this review with that as well. Clearly I was in some sort of food heaven\/coma that gave me amnesia of the specifics of my review. Non the less- go here if you want CLEAN modern Mexican food.
Solid food, comparable prices to other nearby eateries. Had the Lamb and Veal doner all dressed with fries - would definitely order again, very filling and perfectly seasoned. All the sauces were delicious. Make sure to grab extra napkins, they can be messy.

Edit: make sure to visit the washroom and press the mysterious button on the wall.
Décor sympa, du genre méga loft avec un bar au fond...il y a même un lit! On peut jouer à toutes sortes de jeux qui ont sûrement appartenu au arcades Pinoccio (pour ceux qui s'en souviennent).  ALLEZ Y TÔT, pour pouvoir avoir un bon spot pour boire...

Plus la soirée avance, plus la musique est forte et on dirait ambiance de club..! Et n'apportez surtout pas une pointe de Pizza Madonna, vous allez vous faire chicaner :( ALLEZ-Y sans hésiter pour de belles photos instagram et pour une ambiance le fun!
We were seated right away in an awkward table in front of an entrance.  There was loud music, making it difficult to talk and for the waitress to hear me.  The "church potatoes" cheesy hashed brown casserole side definitely had onion it it despite what the server said, and some other things besides potatoes and cheese (I didn't dwell on it and just ate it).  She also didn't know what a hashed brown casserole was, which I found strange.  The potatoes were also cold, which was a big disappointment.  My bacon burger also was not served hot, and you could tell it had been cooking for a while.  It was perfectly cooked and very juicy though!  The sauce (worcestershire-based) was really good, though the bacon was extremely crispy (as in zero moisture left in it - still tasty though).  The bun wasn't that special, and should've been toasted, maybe with a bit of butter to crisp it up.

Dining companion liked his crab cake sandwich.  Our waters were kept full, and besides not knowing the menu as well as she should and getting our food out promptly so it was still hot, the waitress provided good service.

Overall, not bad, but food is served fresh and hot at Ingo's and Zinburger, so they need to step up their game.
This place is always packed so make a reservation if not expect to wait 15-20 min. They start you off with chips salsa and beans!! There Fideo soup that comes with most of their meals are delicious and I love their strawberry margaritas are amazing! Not a overwhelming taste of tequila but still managed to get me buzzed on only one! Try the coca cola carnitas! Service was great. Servers and very nice and will help you pick out what's good because the menu can be a little overwhelming. It's a bit pricey but worth it. 50 with tip for 2 including 1 beer and margarita.
A long time ago I took my parents to eat at Steak 'n Shake.  A friend told me that they had good fries.  He left out the rest.  For 8 years I avoided the place until today.  I forgot to eat a hotdog on National Hotdog Day...or...more accurately hadn't realized it even WAS National Hotdog Day...or...still more accurately hadn't known that National Hotdog Day existed...ANYWAY.

I went to Steak 'n Shake (why is there only one apostrophe?  shouldn't it be 'n'?  Or does it not work that way) to belatedly celebrate.  I ordered a foot long chili cheese dog complete with onions.  Screw my coworkers, I thought, it's National Hotdog Day.  Sort of.

I used the drive-thru.  Something must have gone "wrong" inside.  The line sat still for 5...then 10 minutes.  Finally we moved.  Hotdog wasn't a footlong, but of course, it was too late when I unwrapped it at work to rectify THAT problem.  It tasted okay.  Paid for a footlong, ate a regular hotdog.  Waited in line for "fast" food way too long.  

The girl at the window was apologetic about the wait.  I thanked her for her courtesy.  But it'll be another 8 years at least before I go back.

I rarely rate anything 1 or 5 stars.  But the "I've experienced better" that yelp defines as two stars is WAY overstating my only two experiences here.  "Eek!  Methinks not." is much more appropriate.
Hey Tim Hortons, can you get staff the are a little quicker and not slow as molasses on the f'in job, 5 minutes wait to get a coffee and a parking ticket...87$ cup of coffee!!! Thanks
Great food.. Excellent Biryani, chicken tikka and Naan & chicken 65.  Good customer service.
I'm not really sure what's up with all the bad reviews. I've been here twice and it was great! First time for lunch with a coworker after it initially opened, and second time for happy hour dinner and drinks with a friend. Both visits the service and food was amazing, it also has a really nice decor. 

I'm disappointed I didn't take pictures of my food to share, but it looked so delicious I just dug right in! On my first visit I ordered the chorizo doble tacos and arroz blanco (basically cilantro rice). Second visit, the green chili pork entrée and we shared an order of the sweet corn which was really good with their chips. I had chips and salsa on both visits and they bring out a salsa sampler. The first visit there was a super hot one that is no longer provided, but they do still have it if you're into crazy hot salsa. I personally like to keep my taste buds! They have probably the biggest menu of tequila I've ever seen and our waitress, Kat, was very knowledgeable in helping us decide which one to choose for our margaritas. Speaking of Kat, she's freaking awesome! Super cool personality and very attentive... she also bartends! She informed us they'll be opening up the patio and having a DJ on the weekends, so if you're in the area give it a try! If you're a previous bad reviewer come back, give it another chance, and ask for Kat!
After finding Fitness Road a couple weeks ago, I knew I wanted to swing by this coffee shop the next time I was in the area.  It was surprisingly busy, with most tables inside taken.  I ordered a latte, and since there was only one person working I had to wait about 10 minutes.  No biggie, I wasn't in a hurry.  

The latte was delicious!  The environment was quiet......too quiet.  Service was pleasant.  I think I'm not enough of a "hipster" to fit in here.  Can't say I'd be back, but my experience was A-OK!
190 Octane w\/ a shot (or two) of Everclear!!!!  There's a reason why just about every review recommends this.  It will get you twisted for real!

Fat Tuesday will be one my first stops when I go back to Vegas.  Just don't drink this and immediately go shopping like I did!
There are hundreds of Chinese restaurants in Vegas, so the only reason we decided to try this one is because of their House Special Lobster. Wanted to check out how it compares to the same dish made famous in the Little Saigon region of Westminister, CA.

First of all, the place is LOUD, with big groups of boisterous business types and crying babies. Service is a tad slow too. 

The lobster was good but not equal to the California version. This one has a less buttery flavor, is a bit spicier and with a lot of pepper. We ordered a Thai style seafood soup that could have used more flavor as they seem to skimp on the ginger, galangal and lemongrass.

The mung bean dessert was great. It's not a universal favorite but I'm always happy to eat 2 or 3 bowls of it when others decide to skip it.

Overall, decent place but we will still need to make the 4 hour treck to Little Saigon for the quintessential House Special Lobster.
I attended a Radical skincare event with Dorothy hosting the creator of the line.

She goes above & beyond for me-even hand delivering my order to my nearby work on more than 1 occasion.  The product she represents is outstanding as well.  

I'm a big fan of Jo Malone at Saks, located right inside the south entrance.

Saks has amazing tailoring & alterations that will work with clothing brand not only Saks merchandise.
Whenever we visit Cleveland, I do not hesitate to say that we will be going to Granite City for lunch\/dinner. I have yet to have a meal I did not like.

The first time I went to Granite City, I ordered the Asian Flatbread and WOW was it better than I expected! It is probably big enough for 2, but you know I ate that whole thing by myself! It was delicious! I also ordered an oatmeal stout (I forget the name), but it was glorious. I ended up getting a pitcher because I think it was cheaper than getting one or two beers! Can't beat that!

The second time I went, they were having their Oktoberfest specials! I didn't get beer this time, but we ordered twice as much food haha. We started with the loaded waffle fries and pretzels with beer cheese (which are a must!). The loaded nachos, even drenched in cheese and other topping, were still crunchy! The pretzels, well, I'll let you try them for yourselves! Then I ordered the Reuben...let me tell you...they loaded that sucker up with LAYERS of corned beef and just enough sauerkraut! With a side of their fries - you won't leave on an empty stomach!

Unfortunately I haven't gotten to their desserts, but maybe I've built up enough momentum for my third trip. We'll see! ;)
Strolling along Queen west on a beautiful weekend day amongst the hipsters is a good way to recover from a night of heavy drinking, and Swan is a great place to replenish your body. 

With tasty brunches priced from $10-14, Swan does a good brunch. We tried the steak and Eggs and Huevos Rancheros, and I'd order either again.  

The Huevos Rancheros had a perfectly cooked sunny side egg sitting a top warm flatbread and a delicious blend of tomatoes, onions and hash. Perfect for absorbing the previous night's alcohol. :)

The steak and eggs were good too, with the steak (a good piece, not your thin diner "steaks") cooked nicely (med rare).

All in all, a nice place to stop for brunch - I wouldn't say spectacular, but it's solid. Be warned that there does seem to be a bit of a wait though (but any place worth it's salt in Queen west has one).
Solid Italian hoagie.  I would recommend asking for light onion if you aren't a fan.  A half will definitely feed two people.  Really fast pick-up times even on what appeared to be a pretty busy night.  Hidden gem would be the pizza bagels!
I've drove past this restaurant several times and I decided to give it a chance. I tried the Chimichanga and I was stuffed by the end. It came with lots of sauce and you have a full bottle of sour cream to use if needed (I love sour cream).  After ordering our food did not come for 30 minutes, so I spoke with the server and they quickly prompted the kitchen to make our dishes.  While waiting they gave us some tortilla chips, guacamole and salsa to compensate for the delay.  The tortilla chips were mediocre and nothing special.  Overall, it was a good experience, but nothing really stood out to make me want to come back in the near term.
I was initally going to give a 5 star review for my experience, but I was explain why I deducted star. My iPhone 5 stopped working about 3 weeks ago. It wouldn't turn on and when I connected it to a power source, it just alternated between a black screen with a white apple and a black screen with a white outline of a battery with a bit of red inside. I brought it here the next day, and there was already a line formed outside the store waiting for it to open when I arrived around 11:50am. Once I was served, he knew exactly what was wrong. My battery was fried and he opened up my phone and showed me my visibly damaged battery. He replaced it with a new one  for about $50+tax and everything was working perfectly for about two weeks (one week ago from this review). Up until this point I was definitely giving a 5 star rating! 

Then my phone randomly turned off on itself. I turned it back on and then a few minutes later it was off again. I turned it back on, and it seemed fine, so I just left it. Then a few days later it happened again, but this time it continuously was turning itself right back off again. It reached about 70% power and it just completely turned off and would not restart. I plugged it in and then it seemed to be fine (I should note - I was inside, and had been inside for quite some time - this becomes a bit more important later). The next day I decided to bring it back to the store to have it examined. On my walk to the store (I walked from Yonge and College to Yonge and Wellesley), it turned off, then back on again, then completely off. I was told that iPhones have a tendency to turn off in the cold weather... hmmm.. this never happened once to me in the previous 3 years that I've had this phone.. and it's been outside in temperatures much colder than the balmy 3 degree weather that day! I was a bit skeptical about being given this as an explanation. Then I was told that sometimes when they put in new batteries, you have to backup your phone and restore it to factory settings for your phone to properly recognize the new battery. Fair enough, but I wish I had been told this on my initial visit. Regardless he replaced the battery again free of charge.
Fresh pastas and Italian goods. This is the place were all top restaurants in Charlotte buys their fresh pastas.
My family has been going to this US Cellular for years. They have always accommodated us in the most welcoming, professional, and hospitable way possible. They are always amazing with setting my family up with new phones, and finding ways to lower our monthly bill! The staff is AMAZING in every way and should be commended for their work.
3.5 but Rounding up... Hmmm maybe it's a solid 4...

Cons:
Noisy until about 3am
Showers don't close thus can feel cold
Rough tissues and toilet paper
Toilet sometimes had to flushed twice 
Thin walls
Noisy pipes
$20 resort fee 
Small gym only weight machine is broken
Pillows
$15 for a fridge 
$15 for a crib


Pros:
Clean
Remodeled
Inexpensive 
Free parking right next door
Liked the Adler toiletries 
Not too smoky 
Bed was comfy
S+O restaurant in lobby has good bacon and is reasonably priced

Solid spot 3 days for $80 was excellent value. Casino is small and wasn't really smoky. Fremont street is overrated... but in the summer and if you're young I'm sure it's a blast. If only we could solve the noise issue this place would be almost perfect.

Park in front on 3rd and unload
This was our early evening stop on Day 2 of our trip to Toronto. We were a bit exhausted from realizing that our cell phones don't work across international borders (silly us...) and having to navigate the bus system (where in the world is that 150-something bus anyway?) in Toronto without internet access. We finally made it to the distillery district and sat our frazzled-headed, weary-footed butts down at the sake bar. 

Sake: we tried the flight - got two for the 3 of us and it was well worth it at $10\/pop. We had a great experience trying and tasting the 3 sake's on the tasting menu while chatting with the fantastic and knowledgeable lady behind the bar. 

Tour: 1pm and 3:30pm as I recall, and we missed both unfortunately. I'm sure we would have enjoyed it. 

You can purchase the sake you taste by the bottle. It's a sizable bottle and the kind my friend got was $20 

Definitely worth a stop on the way through the distillery district!
I typically eat Pizza Heaven via delivery, and it shows up to my house in about 20 minutes, which is ridiculously fast. Their pizza is amazing. Their salads are also amazing. Their wings are, you guessed it, amazing! They have several Vegan dishes, and they're very delicious.
3.5 stars had a blast and I got into the water lol

Locker rental for $60 give or take can't remember but worth it!

Drinks are pricey but STRONG!!

Buy tickets in advance!

No shade so get in the pool!

No free seats so get in the pool!

Great place to party not special but fun!

Had a great time! Get in the pool lol but do it!

*other reviews are accurate... TSA level security check to get in... sheesh
Bamboo Club Asian Bistro is a corporate chain of about 10 restaurants, most in AZ, trying to capitalize on the success of that other AZ HQ chain, PF Chang's. The formula is provide Panda Express food in an upscale "Bistro" environment, add table service and a bar, so you can charge more to ignorant Americans who love their sweet and sour pork in a CPK like atmosphere, then expand to locations and sales to eventually go public and cash out before the trend fades. Someone took me to the upscale Biltmore Shopping Center one in Phoenix. I could do better in any Chinatown.
You can see that people only eat here to use the vouchers they have purchased - as they seem to always have some sort of deal available.

unless you come early enough - make sure you make reservations, otherwise it will take up to 30 mins to get seated (for a table of 2).

The food is ok. Not the greatest I've had, but definitely not the worst. For the price you are paying ($15 for $30 worth of food) - it's ok.

Definitely only visit if you had purchased a voucher.
Had a European Facial it was relaxing and areas of concern on my face were attended with care. Renu absolutely knows what she is doing my skin feels soft .  I can't believe how much she did in one hour she did magic on me. Highly recommend her for facial and threading.
Zen Culinary is the new hot joint in my area. I have to say that I do love this place!

Despite this place is new, it seems like the owners have experience in the art of dining. For an appetizer we ordered the Dragon Balls, which I would recommend and will make sure to get next time I come here.

 I had the chicken curry which was just delicious and very full of flavor. It was a huge bowl that came piping hot with veggies and big pieces of chicken. My boyfriend had the Zen Steak sandwich which was pretty big and full of flavor as well. 

As for drinks, I'm not sure I had the best experience. I ordered an Aviation cocktail, which was about a buck or so above what I feel the drink should've been priced at. It was a very, very strong cocktail. Although not my favorite, my waiter asked me if I was sure I liked it and offered to replace it, but I kept it and drank the whole thing. I'm sure other cocktails here are great, so I will make sure to keep trying this place out.

The ambiance is very cool. Dark lit and upbeat music with interesting furniture. The outdoor patio look very zen.

Staff and waiters are friendly, waters topped off regularly. 

Overall, Zen Culinary is off to a great start in my opinion, and i hope it sticks around as it's got great potential to become a neighborhood favorite!
This is a good place to watch a game and eat.  There is a lot of outdoor seating which is a big plus.  There are many televisions.

Our server was friendly and attentive.

We started with the homemade chips and dip.  The chips were crisp and tasty.   The bacon and blue cheese add a nice touch and pair nicely with the dip.

For my meal I chose the boneless wings in their honey gold sauce.  It is a large portion.  The wings are solid.  The honey gold has good flavor.
We usually bring our (not so little) baby here to get his food and a nail grinding. When we walk into the grooming area - making sure there were no other dogs inside - we were greeted by some of the groomers. At first we were communicating by talking across the room, seems a little unprofessional. Once we told them what we wanted they told me that another groomer is coming in at 4 and she will be the one handling the grinding (it was like 3 minutes from 4 o'clock), so we took Rocky out and went to look at some food. We had him on Blue Wilderness (Salmon) but the vet told us to maybe switch it up to another brand that is limited ingredients since he does have allergies. We were looking through the store and only found a handful of brands that I would actually feed my dog. We decided not to purchase our food here because 1. The vet suggested Taste of the Wild (which they did not have), and 2. We felt the food they provided was not up to par with someone we would want to give him.
By this time, it was already after 4. About 4:10. So we walk back to the grooming area, and there she is (about to call us). Anyways, we leave him there and I took the receipt - which I had to ask for so I could pay - to the register.
There was only one register open (out of the three they have) and I was the third in line, which is not a huge wait for me. But it was a holiday week, and fairly busy... Anyways, after a few minutes another register opens up but two people hop in that line. After what seemed like forever - my line started to move - YAY! But the person in front of us, had quite a few items to purchase and the cashier was complaining about how slow the computer was... We decided to move to another register (which had two other people), but actually went quicker than the first one we were in. I check in on YELP and received a $5 coupon for the salon, so I show them and it felt as if they have never seen this coupon before. The gentleman working did not know how to put the coupon in, so he grabbed another employee and she was a little confused so they got a manager. I would think that if they have a coupon out, they would make sure their employees know how to ring them in correctly - or at least know about the coupon. Anyways, I saw Rocky getting lowered so I told my fiance to grab him while I finish and pay. This whole time, the first register STILL had the same guy... 

I would think being a couple days before a holiday they would be well prepared and staffed accordingly. We ended up going to another pet store to buy his food, which is a little more expensive but healthier and better ingredients. I think next time we will go to another pet groomer and see if they are better. 

P.S. I have been here several times, and this is the worst visit. They are usually quicker and less of a hassle.
What a very pleasant little hideaway! It glows warmly out of the old shadows in the night with an inviting wink. Inside, it's spacious but intimate, and the decoration is fantastic - halfway between classy cocktail joint and Southern diner, which is kind of what it is, really.

For a cocktail night, though... It isn't for water buffaloes like me. Given that some of the "Sygnature" (iswydt) cocktails are a fiver, the £5.50 blanket cost for a mocky is a bit of a sting.

Presentation is key here, and most of the drinks come excitingly presented - I made a bad call starting with the apple and raspberry cooler because it was pretty much just a standard tumbler, which I soon learned was unusual. The drink itself was nice and refreshing, but visually not a patch on the monstrosity that arrived when I ordered the Um Bongo. A hefty earthenware tiki jug appeared before me with a leaf of aloe (I think) flourishing on the rim. Whee, such fun to look at! I wanted to put on my grass skirt and hula till the sun sank into the blood red ocean...

But seriously. I think I just paid £5.50 for a can of Lilt...  I mean, I love Lilt, it's my favourite drink, but you can't just pour it into a (admittedly awesome) tiki jug and call it a mocktail. I think.

Ok, being fair, the menu states that there's pineapple juice and bitters going on there, "topped off with" the Lilt, but if I'd been guessing, I'd have said it was the sole ingredient. It was fun, but I felt a bit disappointed - even more so since if actually asked for a non-alcoholic version of the Nutella milkshake only to be told they had no Nutella, so it was actually a second choice.

If I were rating on drinks alone, this'd be a definite two, but the place is so lovely and the food looked so good that it's a solid three, and it might even push to a four when I go back try that delicious looking food for myself. I'll just make sure I stick to drinking only water...
This place does burgers. It does them lots and it does them well. And it does them in about a million combos. Try something different. Just go for it. You will be pleasantly surprised. If you're not...please don't blame me!

Nothing crazy to report. Food was good, service was good. Yum.
Found myself with a sudden cupcake craving on a random Friday afternoon. Who do I turn to? Well Yelp, of course! I've had Honeymoon Sweets bookmarked for a while now and finally had my chance to check them out. 

Arrived at the small plaza and ironically this little bakery sits next door to a gym - haha! The shop itself is quite small with an ordering counter, one table with two chairs, and a bar with a few stools. It was decorated with school buses, apples, A+'s and other "back to school" themed decor - creative and cute! Connected to the shop there is an adjacent formal cake ordering room with several large, lavish wedding cake displays. 

My daughter and I were the only two customers when we arrived and the cashier immediately came out from the back area, greeted us and helped us make our order. I didn't get a chance to try any of their other yummy looking treats as I was determined to get my cupcake fix. Several of the cupcakes were themed in cereal flavors with Fruit Loops or Cinnamon Toast Crunch toppings - to go along with their "back to school" theme. I thought that was a cute touch. Since my daughter was with me I had an excuse to order TWO cupcakes (I definitely ate most of both). Tried a spectacular strawberry flavored cupcake and the Cinnamon Toast Crunch cupcake. The cashier mentioned they are better once they are at room temperature but I couldn't wait to eat them. They were good cold too. 

As we were eating our cupcakes in the shop, a few other customers arrived and ordered all sorts of other delicious treats, including personalized cakes. I'd definitely return for another sweets craving!
I love this quaint little place hidden away from the more known hustle and bustle of downtown madison. It is a nice Cigar bar the features some live DJing and some nights, really comfortable leather seats and a great selection of beers. It is a great place to mellow out and have a really relaxing night!
Great Service would recommend anytime.. Freindly and fast.. Every time I come in they top off all fluids and clean my car
Outstanding service! Warm greeting from the hostesses and our server was extremely friendly and attentive throughout our entire experience. She did a great making us feel special and went out of her way to engage with our baby too. 

Food was delicious! We came during lunch and got the combo to split. It came with a side and there are several to chose from. The combo was plenty for two people- especially with a side salad or appetizer. Loved the cornbread which was served warm with butter...yummm! The ribs were my favorite meat but all were tasty, tender, and flavorful. Such a nice touch that they fry fresh mini donuts at the front and give you a few in a bag upon checking out. 

We'll definitely return! Great dining experience.
Wow. What a random establishment. 

I came here on a Friday night. There was a guy playing some blues on their front patio. They have a back patio but I didn't check it out. You have to go inside to serve yourself at the bar. The servers were pretty clueless. I asked for a glass of their chardonnay and the guy didn't know whether or not they had any. He didn't even check the bar without saying that, and the wine fridge was right behind him. I then wanted to pay for my glass of wine with Visa. This actually probably took around 10 minutes to process, and at the end of it all it turned out that they can't take the combined Visa-debit cards so be forewarned about that! I ended up paying in cash. I paid $15 ($8 for my wine and $7 for my friend's beer. I gave them a $20 and they gave me a $5 bill - which is fair enough, but it made it hard for me to tip them! 

The inside is clean and relatively well maintained. They also have a few board games available to play (e.g. Trivial Pursuit, Jenga, Scrabble). We didn't order any food, but I saw another table's hummus and pita plate which looked pretty good. 

Overalll I don't think I would return as there are better places to visit in the area.
Origins has some awesome products. I highly recommend the Modern Friction face exfoliator and the Vitazing moisturizer. The employees at this store have always been super helpful. They are always willing to give you a *free* mini facial. If you have 15-20 minutes to spare, I recommend getting one done. They will sit you down and cleanse, exfoliate, treat, and moisturize your face. They'll walk you through all the steps and make recommendations for you. Make sure to ask for some samples of your favorite items to try at home. My only complaint... The prices on the items are a little high and the employees can get a little pushy about making a purchase.
So far the water softener is doing great. Dave's services were well worth it. He was at my house from 8a-2p installing it. Thanks Dave!
I have to write this place was a total surprise to me in terms of its service and quality of food. Here we were, at Sun City West where the blue hair crowd was driving golf carts on the streets to get around. 
Understandably then, my expectation to find a tasty Thai restaurant was low. 
Imagine my raised eye brows when we opened the door to a pleasantly decorated and clean interior. Most importantly, the smell of the Thai food was mouth watering delicious!!!
The place was crowded and everyone's plate looked fantastic that before I sat down, I became excited to eat there. 
We ended up ordering the green curry and it was creamy, rich, full of flavor and out of this world!!!
I promptly forgot my no rice rule and mixed the green curry with my rice and it was soooo good!!!!
If you are ever in the area and are looking for a place to eat, this place is highly recommended!!!!  Yum, finger licking, bowl licking clean good!  Yup, it's that good!!!!
on se sent  trop entassées quand danse la - bas . je n'y retourne plus  pour cette raison . la musique  est vraiment brouillante . Seul point possitif  l'entré est  gratuite.
My wife and I found this place after searching for a place open this morning for a foot massage. We were pleasantly surprised. I must admit Aris gave me one of the best massages ever. Her technique and pressure was excellent. My wife enjoyed her massage as well with Carson. Definitely highly recommend the deep foot massage and hot stones were a great added touch. Visiting from FL it was surprising so many places here don't have any air conditioning running. But XY also had the AC on and it was a comfortable environment for the massage. We will be back!!! They are under new management so I wouldn't look at the older poor reviews.
I decided to try out this new gym by my house with a free pass. The gym looks nice from the outside. I just don't understand why all the machines are so close together, every time I turn around I am bumping into people. No one wipes down machines, it's a sweaty and disgusting mess. No sanitizing wipes to be found around the gym. I am extremely disappointed. I will just make the drive to my awesome gym Lifetime.
Not gonna bother writing a super long and descriptive review with almost 200 reviews before me. Bottom line I liked this place, I will come back for sure! Was told multiple times that I needed to come here and finally did. Had the pork sandwich on the brunch menu and it was really good. 
The only problem I had with the place was our server was just a little weird, not rude or anything, she just would comment on things that she thought we were looking at on the menu and just kept walking by with her input, but not a big deal. And then not like this place could help it but I was really bothered by the other patrons there, the tables are close so I guess you can hear other people more than you would want to but some of these people were just real stuck up. Being at a trendy place doesn't make you super cool, so just chilax and have a good time or go home. But yeah, not like they could do anything about it, but if your thinking about going and your a snooty brat, just don't.
This store is simply amazing!!!! The staff is super helpful and friendly. They are my new favorite comics - mtg place!
Great place to see a small, intimate show.  I have seen many acts there and then watch them move on to bigger venues and all I can think about is how I wish they were playing at the Marquee. It's got great sound and pretty much anywhere is a great view.   

But other than that, its nothing too special, just future event posters stapled everywhere and expensive drinks.
Last night, we were planning on going to the TUCK Shop to have dinner but the restaurant was too packed to seat 8 people.  Then we tried going to the Coronado Cafe and SWITCH it was the same scenario.  Driving up on Central I spied the Blue Willo Cafe and decided to try the place.  And I am so glad I did!!
They are doing bbq specials on FRIDAY nights only- open until 10pm and it was the BEST, BEST bbq pork rib I've EVER, EVER had!!  The pork ribs were meaty, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and full of flavor.  Not just the bbq sauce that generously coated the ribs- the meat too!!  It was DELICIOUS!!  If there was no one else in the restaurant I would have been licking my fingers clean it was that good.
The platter was served with 2 sides- we got beans and rice.  The beans were also the best I've ever had.  Full of brown sugar flavor- you can see chunks of bacon and onion.  GASTRONOMIC DELIGHT!!
The owner are from Memphis- super friendly- she was so delighted that I was enjoying her ribs so much that she brought out corn bread muffins for me to try and I could tell they were made from scratch- not "homemade from a box" kind!
For those moments while I was eating those ribs, I feel like I was transported from Phoenix to down South where the folks were easy going and friendly and the bbq absolutely mouth watering.
If you are a bbq lover, you MUST try this place.  ONLY on FRIDAY nights open until 10pm!!
They have Boba! that alone gives them 5 stars! Finally a good boba place in north las Vegas :)
The food here is so good I'm surprised that no one has written a review for this place ! I ordered take out but next time I'm dining in judging the plates I saw coming out of the kitchen everything looked delicious . I ordered the bean burrito stuffed with grilled veggies it came with rice, a salad and guacamole . The food was amazing and portions are huge so come hungry . The prices are reasonable and this place stays open late !
It smelled like Home as soon as I walked through the doors. I had an Italian beef and it was like ordering back home in Chicago. Definately going back. To Those Who Know How Serious This Is.....
THEY HAVE PIZZA PUFFS!
My friend and I both ordered the Siam Noodles based on the waitresses' recommendation. I had the veggie version while she got hers with chicken. We were extremely happy with out choice. The sauce was a peanut and coconut milk combination straight from heaven. The dish was the perfect amount of spicy. My friend wasn't too excited by the chicken but the sauce was too yummy to complain about. We topped the meal of with the mango and sticky rice which was absolutely divine. 

However, the evening took a turn for the crappy when they started cleaning up the restaurant and putting chairs up on tables around as as we were still eating out meal. We weren't notified that the restaurant was closed and the staff was quite rude about the whole thing. 

I would still go back as the food was great but I wouldn't go there to have a nice long meal. Maybe even do takeout to avoid the rude staff.
I only picked up a Black & White Cookie to go.  $3.69 after tax and tip, which isn't bad when compared to the pastry prices at Bouchon or Jean Philippe.  I was rung up quickly and on my way.  They do not accept the mLife card.

The cookie itself isn't super sweet, so the chocolate and vanilla icing on top is where the real sugar comes from.  The cookie itself was enormous and had that soft, bread-like texture you expect from a black & white.  The icing only stuck to the plastic cling wrap when the cookie got warmer sitting in my car.
I'm reviewing the roast pork sandwich. Great bread, tasty and moist pork, sharp provalone and broccoli rabe make for a delicious combo. I only wish I had ordered the 10 inch rather than the 6 inch. Definitely would get that again and wanna try the numerous other sandwiches available.
Great place for ramen! Friendly services. beef tender don is amazing. It's a great way to finish with a ramen.  They only open for lunch and dinner - so go early if you don't want to wait for long. Enjoy.
I am just perplexed by the good reviews of this place. Granted there are only 4 as I am writing this, but still they seemed pretty consistent. 

We have driven by this place a million times and never given it a second glance, but based on the reviews, off we went to give it a try.

First impressions were pretty good. We were seated right away in a large booth. The restaurant was clean and modern looking, although covered in Halloween decorations, despite it being November 10. 

Menu looked pretty good, with lots of selection. The front of the menu is the desserts, which seem to be why most people come here. But we wanted dinner as well. I ordered the shrimp wonton soup and my husband ordered chicken and mushrooms with rice. 

We both ordered drinks. I ordered a tea and my husband ordered a mango smoothie. 

My drink came out...then my soup came out...neither of my husbands orders came. It took another fifteen minutes for his food to come and his drink came after that! No apologies for the wait. 

My soup was pretty basic. The noodles had no taste and a sticky texture. It was bland overall, but not terrible. My drink was good, but small, given the $6 price tag for a tea. 

My husbands dish was just gross. The chicken were little balls that looked like chicken fetuses. Maybe they were?? Filled with bones, making them very difficult to eat. The taste was bland and salty. 

His drink was good, but the straw didn't reach to the bottom of the glass...which wasn't a glass at all, but a wine decanter. He couldn't reach his drink about half-way through and had to borrow my straw.

We finished our meals and started waiting...and waiting and waiting. No one had come to check and see how our meals were and we had to flag someone down to clear the dishes. A girl finally came to go it and did so without looking, or asking if there was anything else she could get for us, or if we wanted refills. 

We REALLY wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt, so we decided to stick it out and order dessert, since it seemed to be what this place was all about. 

We flagged someone down and ordered mixed fruit on a waffle. The presentation of the dish was certainly nice, but it's pretty generic. It's a basic belgian waffle with vanilla ice cream, strawberries, bananas and some melon balls and cool whip whipped cream on top and a sort of Aunt Jemima syrup. 

It was pretty good, but nothing special.

Once we finished we flagged someone down to get our bill. He said yes and left...and never came back. We saw his give other people bills and get food...he basically completely forgot about us. We waited for 15 minutes. We started looking around to figure out what happened and noticed that the wait staff were just chilling in the back of the restaurant. One girl was staring aimlessly at the ceiling. Two others were holding hands and swinging their arms in time to the music. Two guys were back there chatting away...it was actually weird. 

Finally, we managed to flag down yet a DIFFERENT waitress...this was number 6 (one seated us, one took our order, one cleared the dishes, one took the dessert order and one went to get our bill...apparently, and now this one) and asked her to get our bill. She finally did. We paid...we left a tip (we try hard not be be jerks, even if the service is poor) and left...never to return. 

So yeah, bland food, generic desserts and TERRIBLE service = not worth it. 

One another note, another review says, "If you're into young asian girls (and guys), this is the place to hang out." I KNOW this person meant nothing by this comment, but I swear there is some creepy dude who has done a Google search of "Places where young Asian girls and boys hang out" and found this place based on that review...so you know...probably some creepers hanging around as well. Just sayin'! (*Note: This comment, as creepy as it was, had no baring on my review).
Second time to the City Tavern in Waxhaw...each time I have been very pleased with the results!  Last night we had great service from a Server named KIM..she watched every need we had. We ordered Appetizers and Salad. And even ordered a meal for Grandma off the Kids Meal We had the Kale and Apple Salad, with a Apple Citrus Vinegarette.. It was great!  We also had the  Quesidillas with Smoked Gouda..also really tasty. My sister is a Vegetarian and the did everything to help make sure she was taken care of!
They also have a great local Craft Beer selection! Always nice and friendly!
My family and I had dinner here and the wait was ridiculous! But that just goes to show you how many people want to eat here. So TIP#1: make a reservation! Unfortunately, reservations are only for the inside dining, so if you wish to sit outside and have a view of the Bellagio watershow, you have to patiently wait for that. 

They served us with fresh bread in a paper bag with chilled butter and this carrot concoction. I tried to figure out what the carrot spread was, but to no avail. It was delicious though! 

I ordered the Steak Frites Classique and other people in my party ordered the salmon and their special fish. The steak was cooked just as I had asked, and the frites were thinly sliced and very crispy. The salmon was flaky and flavorful. Lastly, the special fish (I forget what kind) was amazing. I wish I asked what kind it was. They left the skin on, which usually does not satisfy my tastes, but this time I fully appreciated it

For dessert, we ordered the chocolate tart with salted caramel ice cream and creme brulee. Though both were flavorful and delicious, they were smaller than I expected. 

Overall, it was both good service and food. I will definitely come here again!
The food is very good, the black and Bleu is one of favorites. Its  juciey tasty treat. The barely batter broccilli is yummy as well. 

Preivously i review this location and it was only so so. But the last servral times the service has been great and my other concerns appear to have been address.
What more can you ask for?  Tasty food and efficient yet friendly service in a cozy, romantic environment.  They only take reservations for a group of 6 or more so be prepared to wait about on hour on busy nights.  Although we waited for about 45 minutes, it was well woth it.

Yelp review
Scottsdale, AZ
El Charro
5550 E Lincoln Dr. · ~2 mi
(480) 964-1851

El Charro is hands down the best fine dining dinner spot in the Phoenix, Scottsdale, Paradise Valley area.  I am a fine dining snob and I have high expectations for restaurants that I plan on eating an expensive meal at and El Charro never disappoints.  Whether you desire a delicious, juicy filet, or flavorful seafood, this is the place to go if you don't mind forking over some cash.

My experience started the moment I walked through the adobe arch reading "El Charro" which is a gateway into the beautiful, romantically lit patio that spans around the open, cozy, adobe restaurant in a nice wide L shape. When I went to El Chorro recently, I did have to wait for my table, but I was able to go and sit at their bar area where I was well taken care of as I waited to be seated.  We were seated about 15 minutes after arriving, but my experience at the bar helped pass the time extremely fast and I gladly say out my wait enjoying my time at the bar.  Once I made my way to the table, covered in a beautiful white linen, and sat in comfortably cushioned chairs, I was almost immediately brought a glass of water and was served their famous sticky buns which they serve to their guests instead of bread.  The sticky buns came out a perfectly warm temperature and were so gooey and delicious.  My server was extremely prompt and made sure to get us our drinks as quickly as possible.  

I ordered the 8oz. center cut filet, served with parmesan scalloped potatoes, asparagus and pink peppercorn sauce on the side.  This entrée totals about $45, but on this particular night I added jumbo shrimp to make it a surf & turf which ran the cost up to about $52.  A price well worth paying in my opinion.  [picture on the bottom of page]
The presentation was stunning and I honestly could not wait to dive into my plate and consume this meal as quickly as my body would allow. Everything came out the perfect temperature and I knew as soon as everything on that plate was finished being cooked, they brought it out immediately.  
I enjoy my filet medium rare, and unlike most places who tend to go a little too rare when I request this, this steak was perfect.  It was so tender and juicy that I did not even use my peppercorn sauce because the steak itself didn't even need anything more.  The scalloped potatoes were creamy and delicious and came out in a nice large helping. The asparagus was cooked to perfection so that they still crunch when you bite into them but are soft enough you don't feel like you're eating asparagus al dente. The shrimp was extremely tasty and HUGE.  You really get your moneys worth for upgrading the plate to a surf and turf.   My parents were celebrating their 30th anniversary this night, and in order to celebrate, the restaurant gave them a complimentary dessert that included a graham cracker crusted white and milk chocolate mousse. The flavors were delectable and I wished this dessert would never end.  

Our waitress, Andrea, was an incredibly nice and a very efficient waitress.  She clearly enjoyed her job and served with poise and class.  She made sure we had everything we needed and I never felt like I was abandoned at my table.  

I would give my experience at El Charro ***** out of ***** stars for its comfortable, open atmosphere, incredible and efficient service, and mouthwatering, cooked to perfection food that is consistently good every time I come to the restaurant.
There isn't much to love or hate about Amos'. It's really just A-OK. 

Live music. [check] - They have an interesting lineup - tons over tribute and cover bands. 
Cheap admission. [check] - Sometimes free!. 
Decent prices on drinks [check] - $3.75 for domestics, $4.75 for "premium" beers
Free parking [check] - I guess that's a pretty big plus in Southend 
Dive-y Music Hall [check] - The acoustics aren't anything to write home about but they do just fine.
This is one of the better off strip steak options.  The views are great from the time you step on the elevator.  The decor is in desperate need of updating, but the food makes up for that.

Our server was friendly and attentive.  He handled our large group well.

I started my meal with the VooDoo Style Wedge Salad.  It is a slightly different take on the wedge.  You get the standard wedge of iceberg covered in crispy cured lomo, bacon, and Maytag blue cheese.  The twist comes with the orange vinaigrette they top it with.  It is a solid salad.  The citrus makes it a little unique.

For my main course I ordered the 12 oz. filet mignon.  The filet was prepared exactly as ordered.  It was tender, juicy and flavorful.  They did a very good job seasoning it as well.  The black pepper gave it some bite.

We ordered a few sides for the table.  I tried the Confit Fried Fingerling Potatoes.  They were solid.  They may be a bit salty for some, but I was happy with them.

This is not a cheap meal by any means, but it is inline with most quality steakhouses in Las Vegas.  The views are worth the trip at least once even though it is off strip.  If you eat later you can head upstairs to the lounge after and get even better views.
I went here for some authentic Mexican food and definitely got it. This looks like a hole in the wall type place. byob which is good for the drinkers! 

The service was not great. The person who served and took my order could not speak English and was so confused when I placed my order. Then gave me the wrong side. 

The food was good but nothing to go crazy about for me. I got a tamale and I enjoyed it! It's just that I am not craving to go back like I usually am. 

Recommend for Mexican food.
Desert tumbling is such an amazing place to send your children to burn their extra energy and learn new skills. They are super accommodating to all skill levels and ages. Cheerleaders, divers, gymnasts, free runners, etc. They teach them all! Paul & Wendy are such amazing people and really love to see the kiddos succeed. I 110% recommend this place!!
1. Remodeled rooms look great, different, loved the "eyes" staring at you lol
2. Towels in the room suck &  toilet paper is ruff!!!!!!
3. Towels in the gym smell & need more weights and\/or machines
4. Not a fan of gambling here roulette is my thing and let's just say s u s p e c t 
5. Food here is average at times maybe lower than that
6. Easy parking, I like that!
7. Playboy club is gone
8. Feel like a degenerate here and not special lol (well I am a degenerate so maybe I shouldn't be offended ha) but people are average here nothing special IMHO
9. Got a great internet deal so totally worth it any more than $100 I'd say add a few bucks and go elsewhere but for $40-$75 per night the new palms is worth it and is a good deal!
10. 2 for 1 drinks and free buffet included with our deal not shabby at all


Just a lil more effort and polish and this place would be a solid option to consider right now though 55% don't stay here\/45% stay here or 95% stay here but only with a good deal...
This is a great location inside Tavoli Village in Summerlin. The building and the decor are visually pleasing. They have a terrace with outside seating that offers a nice view while you are dining.

When you first walk up to the door you are able to see the fresh cuts of meats from the butcher shop on the first floor. There is also a bar on the first floor if you want to have some drinks while your waiting for your table.

The food was pretty good.

The Ribeye was good. It was not the best steak I have ever had, but it was cooked properly and tasted just fine.

The Steak Tartar was excellent.

The kale salad and the portabella fries were also very good.

The service was excellent. The busser and the waitress did very well. The valet attendant even brought my keys to the table for me because they were closing for the evening.

The tables out on the terrace have great views of the valley. I would definitely recommend dining here.

You also have to try the Sunday Brunch. The brunch menu is reasonably price and the food is outstanding. The Short Rib Hash is wonderful.
The rolls, sashimi and sushi are the best I've had in the US!

Before I start with my review, let me provide you with some background on my previous sushi experience! My wife and I both lived in Japan for 6 years until 2011 when we moved to the US, and while there we ate sushi and sashimi at least once a week, and have had the freshest sushi from some of the best restaurants in Tokyo. 

Thus far my time in the US (living in New York) has been a bit of a let down on the sushi front after our time in Japan, so when some trusted friends said we had to try Roppongi Sushi while we were visiting Huntersville, I was a little apprehensive. A quick check on Yelp was encouraging, as a few others appeared to be saying the same thing.

All I can say is that to date, Roppongi Sushi offered up the best rolls, sashimi and sushi I have had outside of Japan. The fish was firm, flavorful and fresh, the rice was actually proper Japanese (or Perl) rice (the backbone of all good sushi), and the creativity of the menu for the rolls was excellent. The staff friendly, courteous and attentive, and the restaurant decor a mixed Asian \/ American fusion style with individual booths for intimacy, and an open area with bar seating if you want to watch the sushi chef at work!

Overall an exceptional experience, and all for a very reasonable price. Well worth a visit - you won't be disappointed!
If you have to go to the emergency room or be in the hospital - This would be one of your better places to choose! The new waiting area is very nice, the rooms are always clean and the medical staff is top notch!
On a late Thursday night, a friend and I were looking for a bite to eat, so after a quick search, we decided to try out Sushi Goyemon. 
We saw online that they close at 3:00 am, which is usually the case for many sushi places in Vegas. We arrived at 2:15 am, and the sign on their door says that last call is at 2:30 am, so we still had time to order. We were seated and we ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl and green tea ice cream. Two simple items that tasted fine. However, I was in the middle of my meal and at 2:45 am, the woman who seated us approached us and humbly said, "Sorry, I don't mean to rush you, but can you hurry up so I can close the restaurant?" I thought we had had 15 minutes left, but I guess the entire staff wanted to go home, so they decided to rush us so they could close early. I wasn't even finished eating! We saw another table leave very shortly after that, and we were the only two left, with the rest of the staff just standing there watching us, waiting for us to leave. It wasn't even 3:00 am yet, but we left at 5 'til. I guess they actually close at 2:30 am instead. I took the rest of my food to-go, and we left. Don't visit this place if you're looking for common courtesy.
Cool spot on a side street off the beaten path in Tempe. The Arizona chicken rolls (appetizer) were good. My husband's salmon BLT was slammin! I wanted to steal his whole sandwich but settled on a few (large) bites. My grilled chicken beer bread sandwich was ok but I wouldn't order it again. Fun, brewery atmosphere.
Well, just what I expected - we had a wonderful meal \/ event. 
The service was great and the pies were even better than the last visit. There is no reason not to go and enjoy an evening here. 
You will be very, very pleased. 
My daughter wants to make this a weekly event
Thank you
I think Over Easy is a very nice breakfast place. Yes, it is more expensive then Ihop and Denny's but the food is really good and has some unique options. I have had in my visits the Dolly breakfast sandwich (egg, tomato, bacon on a English muffin), brioche French toast (plain and Banana's Foster) and the chocolate chip pancakes. Service is also good and overall, it's a nice breakfast place.
I don't really like big box-like bakeries that have popped up over the years, because well... I'm not a big-box chain type person. However, I was in the area, starving, with some time to kill and was craving something to hold me over until dinner. 

What I had hoped for was a lemonade and a muffin. Only thing was, they didn't have lemonade. Boo. Mega mega boo.

Once I figured out where to go to order, I decided on a banana nut muffin and a black cherry smoothie. Speaking of which though, is it ever okay for a customer to not know where to go to order something? Really? I really hope no one thinks this is okay. Luckily, someone behind the counter sensed my frustration and helped me.

The prices weren't bad and everything was ready quickly and I was able to take a seat on a comfy chair in an area no one was occupying. The muffin was huge. Therefore, that combined with the smoothie rather than a lemonade meant I pretty much had my dinner there. Kinda sad. The muffin was fantastic but huge. The winner of this visit though? The black cherry smoothie. Now that I know how big portions are, whenever I need something to hold me over, I'll be back for that. Pure heaven.
I've been going to Paulenes for years to get pedicures. Depending on the day and time, this place can get pretty packed. If you go on a weekday during the middle of the day, I've found the experience to be wonderful with a longer massage. The ladies are friendly and do a good job. I really love the hot stones they rub on your legs with the lotion. 

If you're looking for a clean, professional place to get a pedicure, I would recommend this place. The prices are a tad high but is nice to spoil yourself every once in a while. For a regular pedicure, callus removal and tip, I usually pay around $25. I've never had a terrible experience there and do come with friends often.
Yoga One rocks. Doesn't matter if you are a total newb or seasoned yogi. This is the place to practice. 

For the seasoned yogi: Check the class calendar online at y1now.com and pick a class. Get there a little early to secure your favorite spot. The sense of community at y1 rocks. Everyone I've met has been really great. My favorite class is the heated Baptiste Power Vinyasa Yoga. I always leave drenched. My favorite instructor was Daniel McAll. He rocks. 

For the newb:
Don't worry! I'll admit I was a Yoga newbie when I first stepped through the doors of Yoga One. I came at the recommendation of a girlfriend who practiced here. I'm so glad that I gave it a shot! You really don't need anything to give it a try. Just wear comfy athletic clothes and bring a bottle of water! They have mat and towels to rent. 

When I first walked in I saw the smiling faces of the staff ready to help. I told one of the ladies that I was new and I wanted to take a class. She explained the rates and had me fill out some short paperwork to get me in their system. They offer walk-in rates, which are $15 per class. Or for new students, they offer an intro deal for 31 days of practice for $31. They also offer a ton of $5 classes too! Great option for those that don't want to commit to one month.

The space is beautiful. It is a bit on the small side but they fit a lot into it without making it feel too cramped. They have a retail space that sells everything you could want, from mats and towels to clothes. They sell snacks and drinks too. 

The main (heated) room is large and easily accommodates many yogis. I appreciate the tape on the floor to show you where to park your mat. It keeps everyone lined up nicely. Grab a spot and stretch out. They have blocks and straps for everyone to use. The classes usually have at least one assistant that walks around adjusting your form. You can really feel a difference when the tweak your body. Don't worry about being sweaty! Everyone is and no one cares. 

These classes will have you sweating. I've practiced with many different instructors and I definitely had my favorites. I would seek out there classes specifically which is easy to do on their website. Consider taking the 11 week foundations course. It'll really help with your practice. 

The studio is tucked in the back of parking lot. Look for Bistro La Bon and Family Dollar. Parking is never a problem. Some classes are more crowded than others but I always felt like i had enough space. The bathrooms are small but there are changing rooms in the hall and in the front. Use those to change and leave the stalls open for the well hydrated yogis!
Planned a Bachelorette party for my bestie, and decided to try it out Polo Towers as a local I was trying to get the best bang for my buck. And I loved it, it was great to stay where there wasnt a casino to walk trough to get to the hotel. It was off the strip but walking distance from everything. We had a 2 bedroom villa and the room was great! The staff here was amazing everyone was very helpful!  Got locked out of my room and they had security walk me up and let me in so that I could show my ID for a new card since mine was deactivated.  

They had a nice pool, it is only 3 ft deep so not too good if looking for swimming but nice to kick it in the water and hangout.
Absolutely amazing I loved the experience. I would definitely recommend it! 

Only thing I would criticize is the elevators going into the 3rd tower. They take forever since there is only 3 of them. But to avoid that problem you can take the tower 1 elevators and walk to tower 3 so that it doesn't take forever.
The best vanilla latte I have ever had! The coffee can be a bit different at times and depending on the night your in here it can be a little overwhelming with the live band or open mic. I wish it was more chill... But for coffee shops in the area I think it's great! The people that work there are usually always really nice and helpful. 

The food is actually pretty good! I usually stray away from "vegan this and vegan that" but I manned up have tried multiple things here and have loved just about everything. My favorite is the cheddar bake sandwich! I gotta be honest when I eat here I feel healthier... Its most likely all in my head but who cares! :)
I really like this place. The vegan bar was delicious. I detected cranberries, oatmeal and cinnamon in the bar, among other ingredients. I also had a caramel-vanilla steamer which was tasty. 

The best reason to come here is the people though. The three individuals who were here when I came to Cafe-Ah-Roma were Brian, Matt and Sarah. They were all very kind and willing to help me when I got lost and missed my Hebrew tutoring session.
Cool set up. Solid basic sushi rolls. I didn't try too many of the more complex options. Amigo roll was good. Tasty hamachi nigiri. Great berry vanilla dessert. Had AYCE. Will try again. Prefer Kaizen etc
Try the giant California roll it's great! Lots of happy hour specials on the appetizers although I have yet to make it to one.
Thanks yelpers for recommending this place - first time here and we are very happy that we trusted the reviewers. I can't wait to go back there to try cold noodle, locomoco and other things on the menu.BTW, this place has the best kimchee ever. Thanks Russel for taking care of us - we felt like we are your families instead of customers. We love your food & great service.
I rented a U-Haul from here to move last summer.  It took me 2 days to even get someone to answer the phone to take my reservation and they ended up not having the truck size that I needed.  I made the reservation for a Friday and a Saturday so I would have enough time to move without being rushed.  When I went to pick up the truck the Manager rudely asked me if I really needed 2 days to move?  I said, I did, which is why I made the reservation for 2 days.  He then said, 'you seriously need to have the truck for 2 days while shaking his head'.  The manager also walked into the waiting room smoking a cigarette and when he saw me looked ticked off that I was there and put the cigarette out.  He also gave me a hard time about purchasing the insurance and was just overall surly and rude.  

I give it one more star because the guys who worked in the garage area where we actually picked up and dropped off the truck were very nice and helpful.
Food was really good!  I had the shepherds pie which tasted great but it was a Lil more runny than I prefer.  Service was good.  I wasn't really impressed with the atmosphere.  Johnny Fox's is better for an Irish setting.  We wanted to play pool while we were here but that room was over run with a bunch of meat heads playing darts, maybe they were rugby players I don't know.  It was dinner time and most if the customers were senior citizens.  Doubt I'll come again.
I searched yelp for an honest auto mechanic shop in Chandler.  The review results led me to Brake Masters. 
We recently bought a used car and brought it here under warranty to investigate a funny sound during startup.  James, store manager and fellow veteran, patiently listened to us describe the problem. He and his team investigated and found a top end engine repair that needed to be made.  They got it approved and made the repair.  We got the car back and it runs great.  
James and his team were competent, knowledgeable, and honest. I highly recommend them.
Such a fun idea for a bar. Low-key, casual, and a great wine\/beer selection. Our party of four quickly found a table on a busy Saturday night. We proceeded to play trivia, dominoes, and sip malbec. The service we received was excellent. Our guy was personable, quick with the drinks and knew his stuff. Will be back to this Arcadia strip mall gem. 

side note: the proximity to Bosa Donuts is a major win.
Passionfruit + coconut + cupcake = decadent mouth party

That is exactly what happened when I tried that delicious treat after my tour of the Mattress Factory one afternoon. The passionfruit frosting was one of the most delicious creations my taste buds have ever witnessed. On top of that it was beautifully presented and the cafe is quaint and lovely.
Drive through is a plus especially at 550 in the morning. 

Staff seems tired and not unfriendly, just not welcoming like other places. Overall a clean store though. But ya... Nothing too special here.
Pink's, I don't know how you seduced me, but you did. 

A small group of us stopped here because we were hungry and have heard people rave about this place. I was feeling brave and got the Chili Cheese hot dog burrito with two dogs, chili and cheese wrapped in a tortilla. It did the trick for a drunken evening, but man talk about super upset stomach! Maybe if I ever ate there again I should just try the basic hot dog.
We came for lunch today and I was amazed. 
As soon as we came in someone greeted us by the door and walked us to a nice table outside.
It didn't take long and we had a waitress at the table.
Our waitress was Danielle, who was very courteous and was always checking on us. 

Our drinks came very fast, the same with our food and desserts.
We had ceviche which was perfect, spicy and tasty! They can make little adjustments if you request.
The food looks and tasty delicious!

The place is big and well organized. They have inside and outside sittings.
It's a nice place to have a long relaxed lunch or dinner. And we are definitely coming back!
Cool half moon booths. Great service and attentiveness of staff. Food was solid all around. Extensive menu, including Jain, Gluten free, Vegan, Vegetarian options. I had the lamb vindaloo which I give a 7 out of town. Naan was good. The owner was very interested in feedback and once he found out how much I love vindaloo asked me to come back and try it after he made some subtle changes to improve it. Orders were taken on ipads. I will be coming back, had a great experience overall.
This is reliable Mexican\/American style food that is always tasty and has yet to disappoint.  The salsa is good, the chips are hot and the margaritas are always great.  I have never had anything less than great service here also.  They were even very patient and helpful when I went there with my nephews and niece who had never tried Mexican food before.  This is a safe place to take visitors from out of town who want to try Mexican.
Amazing local Charlotte brewery with unique brews. Big upgrade on space from the original location. I recently saw that they had an awesome private event space. Love their fun special releases and I'm digging their sour program. Definitely check them out!
Recently we ordered a large takeout order. My friends have been here before and enjoyed the food. However, the service is quite a miss. Two times in a row they got the order wrong. First time they ordered the large party tray then charged them extra large tray. When they brought up the mistake the restaurant tried to blame the server and said it was an error because she was new. On our visit, they left out an item and tried to argue that it was not ordered. Also, they did give us any soy sauce for our sushi party tray order. Food is not bad, but be sure to check your bill before paying.
Lbs. Burger is located inside the Red Rock Casino. The only complaint I have is that you have to walk through the casino to get to Lbs.

I would say this is another one of my favorite burger places. They have excellent burgers and great fries too. The service is excellent and the staff is very friendly. The pricing is very reasonable for the quality of the food also.

Highly recommend!
Elegant-modern-lounge decor with indoor and outdoor seating available. Lots of comfy couches and chairs. I'm sure this place looks great at night lit up with all its lights and several fire-pits.

Hubby and I stopped in for a quick day-date to grab a drink and bite to eat. He thought the white sangria was really good and really can't beat the $4 price. Lots of other drinks and specials available during their 3-6pm social hour. We came in a little before then and didn't get a chance to explore them. Also, they have live music some evenings. 

Can't speak to the food since we only ordered the guacamole. But it was served with a slightly spicy salsa and an abundance of chips. Can't wait to try more menu items next time. They have a large selection from appetizers to sushi to tacos and sandwiches. 

Service was great and we absolutely love the ambience. Look forward to returning and adding more to my review once I try other menu items!
So excited to have this in the neighborhood. I stopped in for lunch today with two friends. The Ramen was great. We tried 3 different ones, 2 of them with ox tail. The soups were savory, and the meat juicy and tender. Wonderful Genmaicha Green tea brewed in the teapot on the table. We also tried several appetizers, the garlic edamame was awesome (and spicy). This is about to become a "several times a week" stop for us. Welcome to the Black Mountain neighborhood Ohjahi.
Love this place! Definitely my go to place when I'm in Vaughan. My fave is the Lobster Poutine but everything is delicious. Also great patio and service.
I wish I could do negative stars!!! He discriminated against me because I am mixed. I came to the salon on a rainy day looking jacked up so I had a hat on. After having to wait 3 weeks for a opening when I get there he looks me up and down and says "blowout wont work on your kinda people hair". Mind you I'm wearing a hat he has NO IDEA what my hair looks like all he saw was my brown skin. I am appalled and will be getting my living social refund and placing SEVERAL complaints! It clearly states works on ANY hair type in his ad. Also there are plenty YouTube videos with mixed girls getting Brazilian blowouts , he needs to get real!
Great service first of all. I love Green valley ranch casino. After midnight I hit up the grand cafe for the $6 steak dinner with my bros.  if I'm hungry earlier i hit pizza rock because they have a sick mofo happy hour menu. I always get the calamari with the spicy mayo thing and smother it on my personal pizzas. 

The servers are great and always talk with us. A couple folks that work there are aspiring chefs with big dreams and I hope they get there with work ethics like theirs.
One star since they close at 1, but they close the kitchen before 12:30. If the kitchen closes before 1 then you should change your hours of operation. I really wanted barbecue dammit.
Our 74 yr old neighbor lady "Lavonne" recommended this restaurant to us! Lavonne is a born and raised "Arizonan" (not to many of those around). She has never steered us wrong and has gave us many great restaurant recommendations and, this restaurant is I believe the best she has ever recommended to us.

 Energized atmosphere, great food, excellent service and price is just fine for a steak restaurant.  The cheesy garlic bread is the best I have ever had. We will go back here just like Lavonne and her late husband again and again and again - and next time we will bring Lavonne who has not been back since her husband died 4yrs ago!
One of my favourite Yelp Elite events ever, hands down. I wasn't sure what to expect at first but since I love paintball I figured I'd like Dodgebow. It's just as competitive, fast-paced and strategic except the hits don't hurt as much ;) Great in the summer especially, since you won't be sporting bruises! The staff is so friendly and awesome- they gave us tons of helpful tips and kept us entertained with a variety of games. I can't wait to come back to try the light saber classes and the secret new room that's going to open next month. Thank you again Mariko, Yelp and Dodgebow for organizing a great event! May the odds be ever in your favour.
Parking is a hot mess and I really try to avoid this area altogether over the weekends. Overall, I really like this TJ's. They seem to have the same staff working there longterm (win) and they're always super friendly. This store stays well-stocked and I'm almost always able to find exactly what I need.
Wowwww.  Okay, so - five star rating, not easy to get from me.  But this place HAS to be on my top ten favorite restaurants in Vegas as of this moment.  Their hummus is out of this WORLD.  I actually liked it more than the wrap that I had (which was definitely tasty!).  Seriously.  You have to go and try it for yourself.  It's a hidden gem.  You can easily miss it, even looking for it, as my date and I did.  The service is also good.  The people who work there are really nice, so that's of course part of the five star rating.  It's Mediterranean, so it might go without saying that there are vegetarian options aplenty, but I won't let it go unsaid.  Please, just do yourself a favor.  Go here and try it out yourself.  If you're a hummus lover, as I am, your life is not complete without trying the hummus HERE.  (You can thank me later.)  ; )
Is there anything but KTVK? Most up to date news, weather, traffic, valley activities  and caring anchors! They are actually excited about doing their jobs! And their volunteering for all the most worthy causes in the valley make them tops in my book!
Binh has many years of experience. This shop mostly caters to Vietnamese clients but they do speak English. They are a cash only business, so make sure to stop at an ATM before you come. They recently raised their prices but it's still very reasonable. As of 9\/3\/2016, the prices are $14 for a men's cut and women's cuts are $30. They also offer perms, coloring services, and special occasion hair and makeup. They are open 7 days a week from 9:30am to 8:00pm, except for Thursdays when they close at 2:00pm. The shop is simple but very clean. They also have wifi available for use while you wait. I really can't complain about the service. It's no frills but I always leave happy.
I gave this place 3 stars simply because of this evening. Usually I enjoy Scotyz for dinner, I've had many nights with a table full of finger food and beer. However lately it seems something has changed. Maybe the cook? The menu got smaller with some staple missing, like the Scotyz platter. The prices are higher. Last Friday I ordered a club sandwich. It was terribly constructed and fell apart, and the fries on the side were cold.
Tonight it was a chicken burger (which was good) and a poutine as a side. Sadly, the poutine had actual mouldy cheese on it. The waitress (Natasha) was fantastic about it, she immediately took it back and replaced it with waffle fries, however it was really disappointing and gross that they actually served mouldy cheese. 
The quality has gone way down and is not the standard for them. Their food was always great, beer affordable. Very sad about this.
I had the vegetarian combo plate, a delicious, filling bargain at $12. Served on a big Injera pancake, a wonderful way to eat. BYOB.

I've been to a dozen Ethiopian restaurants and this one seems typical: good quality food in copious quantities at excellent value. Pleasant staff.
At first I was not a believer of the Qdoba experience... but now I am, this is a more particular review of this location as I will go more in depth of the food in another review. This location is ok, it has a very odd line system but it feels really really large. The only real problem that I have with this place is that the Whiskey Jacks Saloon is right next door and their line can go right up to the Qdoba door so you have to walk through a wall of drunken people just to get into the restaraunt. It is relatively clean and is in a great spot for a quick late-night dinner after being out on the town.
So went to The Windsor and had to try this out afterwards.  Ashley got a scoop of the butter pecan and I have to say that it was fantastic.  I got the oatmeal cranberry apricot cookie and the spiced molasses cookie.  The cookies were lightly crisp around the outside with a soft airy quality on the inside.  They were delicious and melted in my mouth.  Yummy.
Staff is rude as hell. Racist and sexist bartender "Michael" proceeded to call my friend (who is Asian) Yoko, squinted his eyes and held up peace signs, asking if she and her sister were "those type of Asians." Then said "I get dibs on the hot one. Which is both of you." 

He then said to another female friend that he didn't think she was competent enough to be an attorney with a chemical engineering degree. What a patronizing asshole. This girl works hard as hell and this is the response she gets? Not to mention, they went out to have a good time with friends, not too get racist and sexist remarks thrown at them. Sorry buddy, but free drinks don't make up for your behavior. Michael and his employers need to be held accountable for their actions.
I eat Noodle Cat at least twice a week. And "at least" is an understatement. From day one, I have been wowed over and over by this place. The staff are extremely friendly, the music is great, and the food never fails to keep me satisfied and excited for the next time I get to place an order! And as a college student, I am totally happy to pay six bucks for a satisfying half order of noodles, not including awesome happy hour specials.

I am a religious noodle orderer. My favorites being the Short Rib Ramen and the Clam Chowder Udon. That being said, Noodle Cat always blows me away with their daily specials! Just when I think they've outdone themselves, along comes another brilliant flavor combination posted daily to the restaurant website.

When I don't order noodles to-go for lunch and instead drag a friend with me for dinner in the hopes of converting them too, the pork chop entree with kimchee apples and fried sticky rice is amazing. And friends are continuously, and pleasantly, surprised with how simply but delicious the menu options are here. 

Such a huge fan of Noodle Cat's attitude of loyalty to green and local products! Like their delicious house infused sake creations. 

All the more reason to support a Cleveland food establishment like this one. 

(I swear I don't work here...though I've considered asking whether or not they have any openings since I already have the menu memorized.)
Decent southern food. Great Biscuits!!  I would come here again to try their breakfast, but stopped in for the lunch.  Soup was amazing, but the southern fried catfish was very thin. I am used to southern cooking where the catfish is very thick and real good.  The fried okra was good as well.  I will be back to look into this place some more!
De. Lish. Us. 

Delux was one of the first restaurants I went to upon moving to Phoenix and I have gone back a few times since, mainly at lunch during the work week. It's my favorite burger spot. 

The atmosphere is slightly on the pretentious side. However, it's very small and pretty cramped. Even at lunch during the week it can feel cramped at a table and there's a big chance of waiting in line awhile. I've sat both inside and outside and felt a little too close to the other tables. It's a little complicated with bigger groups also.

The food however is amazing. I always get the same thing, a delux burger and sweet potato fries. I don't care if you are scared of medium rare, you need to try this thing. It's one of the most amazing burger's I've had and I can never finish the entire thing. I'd love to have a mini one. That would be perfect. A regular order of fries comes in an adorable metal mini shopping cart. Also good to note is that by default you do not get just ketchup with your fries. Being a non tomato eater, it's nice to not have to remember to ask for another dipping sauce. 

Oh the beer list you ask? Phenomenal. Being able to order a red velvet always makes me happy. Unique beer flights make me happy also. 

I never have room for dessert while I'm there but I did have a friend order the cookies they brag about one time. It was rather hard and I wasn't impressed. That cookie should have been soft and chewy and full of deliciousness.

It's a bit on the pricey side, and you typically are going to have to wait awhile and\/or be cramped, but if you're not in a hurry, it's worth checking out.
My wife brought me to this restaurant for breakfast. She ordered a green chili egg and I ordered a carne Asada and egg burrito with cheese. First off, I have to say, that the burrito was jampacked with fresh eggs and a generous amount of beef inside it. The pico de gallo was used sparingly so but I am just adding their pico de gallo salsa to it which made it taste great. My wife enjoyed her green chili and egg burrito immensely. We ordered a tostada and chips as well. Will be taking those home since these two meals field us up. We will be back.
Some might say it's a run down shack but I disagree. I think they play into their name in a great way.
The pizza is super greasy but it really is some of the best. Most cheap pizza in Pittsburgh tastes like cardboard and everyone seems to like it. Fiori's is actually worth tasting. I don't have to put toppings on it in order to stomach eating it- that's the true mark of a good pizza! The sandwiches are decent as well, but I've never tried the pasta or any apps. Large plain cheese pizza is my favorite here.
They have some amazing pastries here. Right now they have the most amazing strawberry pop tart. It is definitely worth getting. It's not overly sweet which was the best part. Hats off to the chef!
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  I can't say enough great things about this company!  First let me point out that the first company I called to come to our office and give us a quote showed up 3 hours late, and we never ended up receiving the actual quote.  I found Just-In Time here on Yelp and based off everyone else's good reviews gave them a call.  We set up a time for Bobby to come out and walk through the office in order to provide an accurate quote and not only was he on time, he was early!  He was very professional, knowledgeable, and advised we use e-crates instead of boxes.  After he was done with the walk through he said he would provide his info to Gina and she would be in contact via email with the quote.  To our surprise she was in contact within a couple of hours!  Once we had an actual move date to schedule for I gave her a call and she was so helpful!  We ended up having 3 guys come out to pack up our office on a Monday, and the next day we had 6 guys and 2 trucks for our move.  Again, both days, they arrived early and ready to rock n roll!  I think it took them about 2 hours the 1st day to pack everything, and the next day (move day) it took about 3 hours to load the trucks.  Super fast, and not to mention this happened during some of the hottest days of the summer here in Phoenix with no complaints!  They were all very polite, professional, and careful with all our items.  They were very patient when trying to rearrange furniture to our liking, and even helped move some furniture previously at our new location from one floor to another.  It was also nice to see that the total came in under our quote!  I would absolutely use them again for any of my moves, business or personal!  When Bobby came to pick up our e-crates he let me know they work in 48 states!  Good to know in case anyone is looking for out of state movers!  Thanks Just-In Time for making our move a little less stressfull!  Sincerely, Pain Stop Clinics - Corporate Office
Nekter is located just outside the east entrance of Macy's in DTS. They have several different drinks that they offer on the menu. You can also pick the ingredients yourself for your drink. I usually go with the carrot, Apple, and ginger. Everything tastes fresh here and the place appears to be very clean. It is a bit pricey, but it is in DTS. Definitely stop by if your in the neighborhood. You will enjoy it.
***Update, Eden no longer offers lunch, which I think is for the best, given the previous mediocre options - though had they offered choices akin to their dinner menu, I'd vote hellz yes to raw lunch. 

This past week, I tried the spring raw tasting menu. The portions seemed smaller this time and I preferred the fall flavors in general, but I am still a total fan and I think that $15 is a fair price. The raw "mac and cheese" was pretty impressive, as was the vanilla ice cream cake. We also tried a hot dish this time, the tempeh mole. I did not care for it because it did not have ANY vegetables, just tempeh and sauce with rice. But my partner really liked it. 

I will be interested to taste how Eden treats the bounty of summer.
Came here a while back for a date night. We had backed escargots-delightful, lobster cocktail- just because its date night, onion soup-good, beefsteak tomato salad with anchovies-cant go wrong, the chateuabriand-finished at tableside, nice and tender. The accoutrements and ambiance are a reminiscent of vintage supper clubs. Its a special spot.
One of my go-to options for delivery through Wheel Deliver. Love their hummus but I'm not so crazy about their baba ghanooj which is weird for me because I usually love baba and hate hummus; thanks for messing with my brain Ali Baba! The fatoosh is usually amazing (though there have been a few inconsistencies in quality) and the mujaddara is quite good. The falafil and stuffed grape leaves are skippable here as far as I am concerned. The pita is fantastic, and they give you tons of it with to-go orders or delivery, big plus! When dining in, I always truly appreciate the pleasant design of the restaurant, although it's a bit run-down and dated (dated 1982, actually). The best thing about Ali Baba, is the font used for the restaurant name; it adds to the character and appeal in a way that I feel unable to explain.
I approached this place with mild skepticism.  "We unapologetically brew hop pronounced styles ..."  I'm no hop head, but I appreciate a well-hopped beer.  With stiff competition from another local brewery, I was prepared to write this place off as one-note.  It's not. But...how much can you really do with hops?  

A lot.  You can apparently do a lot with hops.  In fact, you can make a highly hopped beer taste...not hoppy...or at least not the hoppy you might be expecting.  Mellow to highly bitter, the beers I had covered the whole hop spectrum.  Beers with hints of grapefruit and melon, coffee and chocolate from beer to beer to beer.  This is no one-trick pony.  

The "Better 1 or 2" is one of the best beers in Pittsburgh.

I sampled five of their beers (a sampler and a 16 ouncer) and didn't find a weak offering in the mix.  This place is going to give my favorite a run for the money.  

Decor is a clean, minimalist industrial.  The sole non-functional bit of decoration I observed was a map of all the microbreweries in the United States.  No wasted space on clean white-tiled walls.  Edison bulbs hang on pendants over the bar area.  Signage consists entirely of a large flatpanel board announcing the beers on tap.  

No food inside, although the food truck du-jour was bringing food inside for hungry patrons too cold to wait outside for it.

I liked it.  A lot.
Location Location Location! Charlotte's great place to have a glass of wine and people watch. Dolce Vita is located in the Queen city best location in town, NODA. Great outdoor seating and good wine selection. Absolutely one of our favorites. 4 thumbs up!
Last year my son went to a birthday here and he just could not stop talking about how much fun he had. 
So this year, we had my son's birthday party here on a Wed night being that he did not have school Thurs, Fri and it was the perfect night to have it being that it was not too crowded yet enough people showed up to make it fun. 
They had one game with 21 people- blue vs red, break for pizza, then another game of blue vs red vs yellow- my son and his group of friends won and they were super excited!!!  After the second game, they had cake then I gave them tokens for the games. 
This setup was perfect for an 8 yr old birthday party. Any more games would have been too much. 
Just by chance, Angela (one of the owners) was the high school friend of one of my friends so she gave us a tour of the facility!  The place is big- def will not have any problem for large parties. 
If you don't want to buy one of their birthday packages you can set up your party in the eating area- it worked out just fine. 
Everyone who worked there were super nice. The girl making the pizza even timed the food so that it was pipping hot for the boys just as the first game ended. 
To share how much fun the boys had- one of them said the party was better than Mine Craft- didn't even know that was even possible?!  Lol. 
I would def have another birthday party for my son here again!
tourist trap, and a chain from texas, pre made bbq sauce from from factory but it is good bbq and the side are good and so are the desserts, you should try if you like bbq.  must get the prime rib, moist brisket, Banana Pudding. the baby backs are ok.
I headed into Young Plantations\/Reid's Fine Foods today for the first time in about three years. My next-door neighbor's husband suffered a minor stroke late last week and I really wanted to bring something nice over for them that was beyond the flowers\/balloons type of "Get Well" gift.

I wandered about the store a little aimlessly looking at their gift baskets of snacks. A woman approached me, and asked if she could help me - her name was Theresa. I told her what I was looking for: Something heartier than snacks, something that could save them some time. She suggested a delicious looking house-made frozen lasagne from their freezer case that I decided to pair with a nice bottle of red, for when he can drink wine again.

Theresa went in the back and magically turned these two things into a lovely gift, with heat-shrunk plastic and a spring-like series of tulle bows and ribbons that didn't look too "girly" at all. She gave me a card to fill out, and then incorporated it into the gift.

I jokingly mentioned that I had bought the wife one of those "freeze your own\/liquor included" Margarita drink packs from Harris Teeter a few minutes earlier, since she was no doubt incredibly stressed. Theresa said, "Bring it in, I can wrap it up for her!" She took the drink pack and in a few minutes appeared with it in a festive bag and more curled ribbon. Brilliant! She didn't even charge me for that.

I asked about the Reid's Fine Foods items available throughout the store. Theresa informed me that Young Plantations bought Reid's and that this was now a satellite type of store for their foods. (I loved Reid's Fine Foods uptown, and not just because I share a last name with them!) The quality of Reid's foods are definitely present in this offshoot store, and I heard another staffer mention that in the future they hope to offer fresh meat at this location as well, eventually. Currently, they have an outdoor farmer's market type setup for fresh produce. You have to buy your produce outside separate from what you buy inside. Still, it's a great place to get fresh local fruits and vegetables. 

Thanks to Theresa and Young Plantation\/Reid's Fine Foods, I was able to bring over a festive, put-together gift that was a lot more practical than flowers or a balloon. I'll definitely be heading back there anytime I need a gift of food from the heart for friends!
It was about a 2 1\/2 hour class for the adult\/child\/infant CPR\/AED certification. John did an excellent job teaching the class. It was very informative. It was only $40. I think the American Ref Cross charges twice as much.
What a surprise to leave the country for four months with no Jimmy Johns nearby and come back to find several within delivery distance. After leaving the midwest I've occasionally crave Jimmy Johns. It's pretty much the only sandwich shop I enjoy and hell, they will deliver one sandwich. You really cannot do much better. And yes, you can even include sprouts on your sandwich. Yum.

I swung by on my way into an afternoon meeting once and was not disappointed in their service, which is on par with my expectations. By the time I ordered my modified sandwich (replacing tomatoes with sprouts) and was given my change, my sandwich was ready and handed to me. Talk about service. You really can't beat it. 

Pretty good experience aside from the hipster college kid at the counter that commented on how much pink I was wearing and when I replied thank you he looked very confused. He'll need to get used to the pink...

I haven't tried this locale's delivery yet, which is the true measurement. Hoping to taste great things from this place whenever I get the JJ craving!
This place is the amazing. Always packed for a reason! Make sure to order "the shit".
The Griffin is not your typical Las Vegas pub! It is like any other bar you would find in any city in the states. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, Vegas needs more these bars for locals, college students etc to go and enjoy a drink and not hear the ringing of slot machines.

With a few fire places in the middle and lounge seating it makes for a great place to hang out with friends for a good night.
I love Green. My husband and I have only been vegetarians for about 9 months and we were pleasantly surprised to find this restaurant a few months ago. We have tried many of the dishes--so far my favorite is the Green burger. The food is tasty, the atmosphere is laid back and customer service is usually pretty good. My favorite part about eating at Green is dessert...Betterfingers Tsoynamis are a must for me. It is delicious and satisfying! Really the only reason I can't get myself to give 5 stars is because of their prices...they are a little high for my taste but is not enough to deter me from returning!
Whole foods- not the average grocery store!

I usually go to the whole foods closer to home on Scottsdale rd south of the 101.  When this whole foods opened by my work I didn't think much of it. Right by trader joes??? Weird!

One day I decided to stop in for lunch and see what I could find for something different.  Usually I get a salad at true foods or the Starbucks protein plate... I walked in and saw the juice bar right next to a huge selection of washed and cut fruit- perfect!  I grab a square filled with strawberries, mango, kiwi, and blueberries for $4.99. 

But I'm hungry for food not only fruit! Then the holy grail of grab and go lunch: the sushi station in the back left corner. Amazing beautiful packaged rolls made daily.  They have beautiful and fresh sashimi, rainbow rolls, spicy tuna, vegetarian, you name it!!! My favorite right now is the poached salmon roll (7.69) and the cucumber avocado roll($5.99). I've  tried so many of these and every time the rice is perfect and the nori melts in your mouth. This is the first grab and go sushi I've ever liked at ALL!

So now that you can tell I'm at wf all the time I will share the last best secret of this spot: bulk cookies and candy.  A mix and match dream- like an adult sweet factory that is half cookies!  I get the pink sprinkle shortbread cookies, and the local glazed lemon cookies, or the vegan peanut butter cookie.  So I'll grab one of each of those cookies plus like 5 gummy bears and it's like $1!! Small and yummy with variety (not pigging out on a pack of Oreos.)

Lastly, the drink cooler has some unique organic chilled teas and sodas.  I've tried a peach vanilla soda, an organic sparkling blood orange soda, and my favorite the synergy kombucha!  Fermented tea is so good for your liver and they have a great variety of flavored kombucha like guava goddess, or strawberry serenity.  Do not shake the drinks tho!  The live drink has major floaties but that's good!  Those guys do the heavy lifting in your liver.

Seriously, be me and get a poached salmon roll, 3 cookies and a kombucha tea!
Had the egyptian chicken fajita with rice and it was delicious!!! The owners know how to present delicious authentic food!! These egyptian plates are only available fridays and saturdays.
I love this place. It has a great variety of organic produce at a reasonable price!! They also have a great vitamin and supplement section and a great juice bar and section to order your food. Every time I go in I feel more dedicated and determined to live a healthier lifestyle!
Well, hate to join the bandwagon, but this place is the real deal! I went here based on Yelp reviews, which after almost a dozen, averaged 5 stars! But several were from newbies to sushi, so I was skeptical, even with a recent ROTD. Had to try for myself.

Yasu's is in the Target\/REI mall on the corner of East Cactus and Paradise Valley Parkway West, on the edge of Scottsdale and PV, adjacent the Army Recruiting office! 

The restaurant is immediately recognizable as Japanese owned, by its tasteful and elegant decor in subdued natural tones of wood and stone colors. Clean, modern, with understated class and attention to detail. It isn't large, with only 10 tables inside, 8 4s, a cozy 2 by the sushi bar, and a 6 in front of it, with a small L shaped stool bar next to the sushi bar which only has 2 benches seating 2 each. Outside are 3 more tables in a fenced patio with Tiki lamps aburning. There is a hostess, a Japanese floor manager, several youthful Eurasian servers, and a mostly Latino kitchen staff. Yasu and Takeshi do all the sushi behind the sushi bar, and pace each diner well. 

They specialize in a daily special menu. Samples for a Friday night included:
- Kampachi (baby yellowtail) $12
- Kumamoto Oysters (half shel or Sumibi) $10
- Aji (Spanish Mackerel) or Striped Jack sushi or sashimi ($5.5\/$12 and $7.5\/$16 respectively)
- Whole Black Snapper (from the Sumibi Yaki Grill) $20
- Saikyo Beef Tongue ($8)
- Grilled Pike ($8.5)
- Grilled Squid Surume ($13.5)
- 5 oz Wagyu ($75)
- Cornflake Shrimp w\/Tartar Sauce ($8.5)
- Karaage Black Snapper ($22)
- Sake or Miso Steamed Manila Clams ($8.5\/$9)
- Foie Gras w\/ Japanese Eggplant $13.5 
Obviously from other reviews, many of these are standard faire daily. 

Sushi is moderately priced, with basic Nigiri from $4.5 - $5; Exceptions are sweet shrimp ($8), Crab Leg ($6.5) Uni and Mirugai ($7.5). Sashimi are reasonable from $7.5 - $10. Rolls from $4 (Maki type) up to $12 max (hand styled). 

I went for a $50 Omakase (I count on you, chef) and Takeshi went to work. 

1. Duo Cherrystone Clams on half shell atop its own caligraphy covered ceramic charcoal hotpot, garnished with minced green onions, fresh ginger and a dab of spicy tuna mix, doused with Ponzu sauce, taken to a boil in front of you. OMG! AYKM? ($7.5)
2. Crystal white Himame (Fluke) fish garnished with minced green onions, morsels of katsuyaboshi (bonita shavings), ponzu, and shaped and decorated to look like a mini sperm whale with eyes and gills ($5.5)
3. Hard to find Striped Jack (Shimajii) red striped white fish au natural ($7.5)
4. Saba (Mackerel) served without garnish ($4.5)
5. Seki-Saba (special mackerel only bought in 2 places in Japan, just arrived today) $6 (smoothest, melt like butter Mackerel you will find!)
6. Sake (Salmon) Yasu Style: Scored, seared on the Sumibi Yaki Grill for a smokey flavor, sprinked with ponzu sauce (don't dip into shoyu\/wasabi!). Best tasting salmon I have had! Soft and flavorful! ($4.5)
7. 4 inch long narrow hand roll filled with buttery Uni and a hint of spice ($7.5)

Total with $6 large Asahi Super Dry: $49.

I waited 20 minutes for the sushi bar, and as it happens that I was a single, another single came nearly simultaneously, and we talked, shared sushi, and with Japanese politeness, poured each other's drinks. I shared sushi, and they shared Seared Scallop Carpaccio, which were about 8 small sand dollar sized scallop slices, very tender and white, garnished with minced negi, katsuyoboshi, and ponzu.

I complimented Takeshi (Umai, Oishikatta, Subarashii!) and left him a $20 bill because I was so happy! (I tipped the wait staff, too)

Anything Asian with "Bistro" in the name makes me a bit nervous that it is some convaluted Fusion Crap joint trying too hard to be Hip and Chic. Not the case here!

Yasu's rivals other sushi-ya in LA, SD, SF, LV and Seattle, and costs less than ones of equal quality and creativity. I highly recommend it!
Very prompt and attentive service. We only had dessert but it was a good experience. Loved the decor as it seems to be a bit newer compared to other locations I've been to.
A friend brought me here for an early Sunday brunch. The restaurant is tiny and the line started  piling up by 10:15. Good thing we got there early and nabbed a booth. Don't come here after 10 unless you're willing to do a wait.

Onto the service: it was okay and the waitress checked in on us a few times. The food took a very long time and we saw some people who came in earlier getting their food before us. We tried not to stare at them jealously but I think they noticed (whoops). 

The food: I got the ricotta pancakes - one of the few vegetarian options on the menu. The ricotta and sour cherry toppings served no purpose to the dish. They used real maple syrup which was lovely but the pancakes were just a disappointing vehicle for the syrup. 

We ordered cappuccinos which came served in water glasses. This meant the glasses were too hot for us to hold and we had to wait for our drinks to cool down which was just so impractical. 

The restaurant really commits to it's hipster vibe with the decor, menu and impractical glasses. I wasn't really excited by the food and left wondering why I spent as much as I did.
We came here after reading the yelp reviews on Day 2 of our Toronto escapades, and you do not disappoint yelpers! Thanks for the heads up!

Ambiance: this is actually one of the nicest dumpling houses I have been to - softer, wooden decor, but ambiance is not as important to me 

Food: By far the best thing we had - PAN FRIEND DUMPLINGS - get these. The soup dumplings were very good, but weren't as soupy as I'm usually used to. I really enjoy biting into the dumpling and getting a gush of soup (I know, sounds....interesting....o.o) and that's not really the experience here, but still tasty. We also ordered the green beans, also very tasty (but be warned, salty), and I would recommend

Service: very attentive servers and we were seated quickly on Saturday a bit before lunch time. 

be warned: they accept US cash, Canadian cash, or Canadian debit. If you're have US dollars, they won't exchange, but will give you a 10% discount, so really you want to change your money

definitely worth a stop!
I love Peradise because it is welcoming, fun and a GREAT workout! I have only gone to Zumba here but both Beth and Stephanie are amazing instructors. I always feel comfortable and for only a $5 drop-in fee, Peradise is my place of choice to get my sweat on!
The matzo ball soup is bland but the corned beef and pastrami are really great!  Generous serving of meat, unlike many other local places.  Sometimes it's difficult to get them to toast or grill the sandwich though since they really try to get you through the line rapidly and they don't ask you if you'd like the sandwich served hot.  Their fries are very decent, and the dessert isn't bad either.  The interior is a little too plain cafeteria-ish and fast-food like (white, pops of color, looks cheap) but they're moving soon so I'm sure they're addressing that and the lack of younger customers.

They're slammed at lunch but they get through the line quickly.

Absolutely fantastic parking!
I love these place, cool bar (outside area) and good fish tacos. The employees are very sweet and the place is kept clean. It seems to be the new hang out instead of Kona Grill and a lot better priced. Try the Maui onion rings.
As most people know there are a lot of ups and downs to planning a wedding.  The event coordinator at ACC made most of this very easy for me.  I was worried things wouldn't come out the way I wanted but Amy, Carrie, Jose, and the rest of the staff made it all come together perfectly!  The food was AMAZING!  I've gotten so many compliments on Jose, my banquet manager, and the rest of the service staff.  My only complaint would be the price, but since the rule is you get what you pay for I can't really complain!  My day was perfect, I wouldn't have changed one thing, and I can't thank them enough for all their hard work!
Good food and great service, plus free salsa bar!
Sooo . . . I've been coming on and off to this place since it first opened and it has gone through several incarnations from buffet to sit down to something in betwn that I really wasn't sure what was being served when I opened their door this past Sat. 
Much to my pleasant surprise, the place was bustling serving dim sum a plenty.
And the place was packed with my kind of people (Chinese in case you're wondering. Haha) so I figured the dim sum must be pretty good. 
I was not disappointed. Everything I had was up to standard. I had 5 dishes plus got charged 65 cents for having water and the tea that was not served to me. 
When I questioned the 65 cents and told the owner I did not have tea, he pointed to a handwritten sign taped to the cash register hidden behind stacks of to go menus that said 65 cents charged to every customer for tea AND WATER. Okay, I didn't realize when I crossed the threshold I had been transported to China or Europe where they do charge for water. 
I also questioned an item where they charged me for a large item when I only had the small dishes and boy, did the owner insist on every penny!  Okay, dude I won't argue with you. So somehow for five dishes, water, and tea that I didn't get the bill came to a whopping $17 which I thought was freakin' expensive for dim sum at lunch time. When I saw the bill I almost wish I could have thrown up the food and return the dishes back to them. Alas, I couldn't and didn't so I paid my bill and left. 
Sigh, since dim sum has become trendy and popular I think it's driven up the price!  I remember when I could have 5 dishes for less than $10!  Oh, the good 'ole days!
Pochos is great. Great prices and a nice selection of Mexican and American food. Phoenix is full of Mexican food restaurants so it's nice to have this place offering traditional American breakfast and burgers. The specials change every day and are priced amazingly. Great place, clean and friendly. I eat there at least twice a week
Some of the best pizza I have ever had! They have a nice selection on the menu with a large variety. The ingredients are tasty and delicious.  I wish it wasn't so close to my house because I might go daily.
Consistency is a rare commodity, and Herbs & Rye steakhouse endures the old school steakhouse and bar. 
The minimal interior (velvet wallpaper is my favorite) and masculine atmosphere is old school Vegas.  This town needs to be back in The Rat Pack days;) 
Emily easily achieves to strike a chord with the customers at Herbs & Rye!  She has the ability to mix and serve a cocktail, all the while exuding a rare charm. 
Their menu will please any carnivore's cravings  with outstanding cuts.
This is nestled away from the Strip and by all means if one is visiting the Strip- please do make a point of coming into this gem.
This theater is great for its location more than anything else.  I've seen movies here both in regular format, and 3D IMAX.  Really loved the IMAX.  The only thing I would criticize is that the seats in the theaters are often not clean, with food or junk debris all over the place.  The bathrooms were super gross when I went last time, and one door doesn't even have a latch on it.  I see other reviewers have also noticed these things, so apparently it's a consistent problem.  There are better theaters in Vegas, but there are also probably worse ones...
Gourmet Burgers? Not even close! I would recommend Fat Burger and In & Out Burger before I would recommend Red Robin.

We ordered the "Big Whiskey" and the "Black & Blue".

I have not eaten a Whopper since I was a kid, but after trying the BW, I now remember what a Whopper taste like. Seriously, I thought I was at Burger King. The only difference was the $12 that Red Robin charges you for the burger. Then I was offered the option of parmesan fries for an additional .99 cents. I was served old fries that were cold and broken in small pieces.

The Black & Blue was good. It was made with Black Angus Beef, mushrooms, and blue cheese. It was served on a ciabatta bun.

The service was good. We were greeted by a hostess upon our arrival and she also asked us how everything was before we departed. The server did a fine job and a woman that appeared to be a manager stopped by our table to say hello. The server brought us fresh fries after I brought the old fries to her attention, so I did not bring it to the managers attention. The cooks should not have sent the fries to the table though. Also, when I asked the server if the meat they used for the Big Whiskey burger was USDA Choice, she said she would ask the kitchen staff. Upon her return I was notified that there was not anyone in the restaurant that could answer my question.

Summary:
$37 for two small burgers, two drinks, and two sides of fries.

I do not recommend Red Robin as place to go for burgers.
This place is simply incredible. We've dined in as well as received catering from them and our guests were blown away. Incredible food and a great atmosphere and BYOB. Seriously top notch
I'll add to the numerous 5 star ratings here. I was at first skeptical going to this place as its location is in a larger shopping center (pretty typical for Phoenix\/Scottsdale). I had been to the Mastro's in New Port Beach, CA and didn't think this one would hold up but I was wrong. This place has it together from the time I called in my reservations to when I walked out the door after dining. Yes it is expensive but at least you feel like you get what you are paying for here. Portion are huge so I suggest sharing and the service staff is happy assist. Thomas our waiter was super professional and friendly. Not a hiccup all night. They have two wine lists, expensive and very expensive. However pricing was not too far out of line from what you would see elsewhere for the same wine. I have had fish literally all over the world and there fish was some of the best I have had any where. I had the wild, line caught, white salmon, delicious! 
To Mastro's owners, please put a Mastro's Ocean Club in San Francisco, I think it would do well there. 
If you have a special occasion or date I highly recommend Mastro's Would\/will return when in the Scottsdale area again. 
Only negative I saw was paid valet, at this high end establishment and with tons of available parking it seemed almost silly. 
Tip: Portions are large so share.
We've been going here for a few years and he's the only mechanic we trust.  We take all our commercial as well as my personal vehicles here.  I cringe at the thought of having to take my cars somewhere else because I just know Jeff will be honest and I'm not sure about the other companies out there.
I have to admit I don't frequent this area often - and driving around Bathurst looking for Gayle's it certainly didn't look an area that would be home to city-renowned bagels. Older commercial building which have seen better days line the streets. Looking left you see some closed up shops, looking right much of the same. 
Or maybe I was just in a mind-altered-movie-state during TIFF weekend. 

Any ways, even on a Friday afternoon Gryfe's had a few customers in line, each ordering a dozen of whichever types of bagels they had on hand. When they're fully stocked, there's about a dozen varieties, although they're all fairly traditional choices: sesame, poppy seed, extra poppy seed, flax, everything, cinnamon raisin, plain, etc. Soft, fluffy and airy, these bagels are pretty good if you're into that kinda thing. They're $0.60 each or $7.20 a dozen. 

That being said, I personally enjoy bagels with a it more chew and texture to them (like Montreal style bagels), but regardless, the carb-monster inside of me made yet another appearance when I picked these up, as I quickly devoured two bagels and an apple turnover.  I can certainly see why folks like the bagels, IF they like the soft and fluffy variety. They also toast up pretty well, which adds some good texture to it and is much more down my alley. The apple turnover ($1.15) was good, though the apple filling could have used more cinnamon. 

They ran out of their $1 pizzas by Friday afternoon, since they're closed on Saturday and don't want to bake more in case they don't sell out that night. Great to know that everything here is fresh!

If you do come here, I'd suggest you do not come on a Friday afternoon, as a lot of their bagel varieties and pizzas are sold out. 

I'm giving it 3 stars mainly because I'm simply not a fan of the softer, fluffier type of bagel, but they're good, all-in-all. 

Great friendly service, definitely a neighbourhood joint .
So, I recently turned forty. What the heck are ya gonna do about it, right?

Well, I'll tell you what I did about it - I went to Sona Med Spa in Ballantyne to inquire about a number of treatments.

I'm not usually a vain person, but something just clicked when I hit the big 4-0. There are things that I don't like about my body, and dammit I have the means to do something about them, so why don't I? There's no reason to live with something you don't like if you don't have to.

I visited Sona Med Spa and talked with Cassidy, who gave me pricing on laser hair removal (bikini and underarms) and laser treatments for the rosacea on my face. My leg hair was really too light for laser hair removal, so that was out, but I was sick of shaving the rest. 

For laser hair removal, I had previously visited "Ideal Image" for a quote as well. The woman was nice, but she tried to sell me on leg laser hair removal, even though my hair was clearly too light. Sona had MUCH better pricing on the laser hair removal, and I could get the AFT package for my rosacea at a great discount. Both combined were cheaper than the quote I got for just the hair removal at Ideal Image, so I jumped at the offer from Sona.

I figured I'd wait until I was through with most of the package purchases before writing a review. So here I am, after 4 AFT and 4 laser treatments. The AFT has worked great. I had so many broken capillaries and veins on my face that I needed foundation just to look decent. After 4 rounds of AFT, I can't find a broken vein around my nose. My face looks more clear and calm and I don't have nearly as many flushing issues as I used to have.

The laser hair removal has been a mixed bag. I'm about 50% done with hair removal by my observation, but I only have a couple of sessions left. I will probably need additional sessions for full hair removal. Still, after session 3, I really started to notice a decrease in hair on my bikini line and underarms.  There is still a way to go.

To be clear: both procedures hurt. Some of them hurt like "HECK"! AFT is worse than the laser hair removal for me. (If your hair is dark and coarse, laser hair removal will hurt worse, but mine is medium coarseness, at best.) Sona will provide you with an Rx for a topical anesthetic ointment if you want. After 2 AFT sessions I opted to purchase the ointment. For my 3rd AFT session, I showed up with a face "numbed" by the ointment and having popped 4 Ibuprofen preemptively for pain. It was still awful. So awful that I decided to forego the ointment and Ibuprofen for my last session. If you're doing AFT, you kind of just have to suck it up and realize that beauty and even skin tone HURTS. Half of it's psychological. The other half is terrifyingly physical. :-) But if you get Roe, just chat with her and she'll help take your mind off things.

Suffice to say, I celebrated my last session of AFT even though it meant no more sessions with my buddy Roe. 

I have to dock Sona Med Spa in Ballantyne a star because sometimes their scheduling is awful. I have waited for 65+ minutes for a 15 minute treatment before. They have lost two of my appointments. Their scheduling is terrible. Now, I get them to write my scheduling down on cards, and I save them like they're lifelines. I once received a call to confirm an appointment, and when I called back to say I could make it, they had LOST the appointment in their system.

The people at Sona Med Spa Ballantyne are great, but their scheduling system is hideous. Be careful about scheduling and be prepared to wait an hour for your service. If they can see you in 5 minutes after you arrive, it's a bonus!

That said, I arrived 45 minutes early for an appointment one time, because I had put it in my Outlook calendar for 11 (instead of 11:45 - seriously, save those cards!). When I showed up uber-early, the receptionist took the time to help me schedule all my next appointments AND answered all of my questions about Botox during the time I was waiting. So, as I said, they're good people. Just get firm on your appointment times.

I do like Sona a great deal. Watch your appointment times like a hawk, show up and watch your age issues melt away.
The drinks here are great! The atmosphere is so nice too! Great service as well!
Best pizza and no doubt....wings in town. Great service and staff. A must visit. If you live in town or are visiting the queen city, check them out.
First time at Campiti's and it was great! Staff was very friendly and welcoming and the restaurant was very clean! Cleaner than I've ever seen a pizza shop. Fantastic sign to me! I'm not a big pizza eater but this was worth it. Thin, crispy crust and loads of toppings. Came out quickly even though it was a Friday night and the phone rang constantly while we were there. Inside has maybe 4 tables (can't quite remember) each with a few chairs. And they do have a high chair. Loved it!
Start by saying this place is amazing. The wait staff was really friendly and real helpful with the menu. This place is definitely a gem in Huntersville. 

This is some of the best food I've had I ever had. Every item was fill with so much flavor. I see why this place is called a Latin fusion. The calamari was great for our starters. Dinner was great as well. I had the grilled cilantro steak which was made perfectly. 

All in all, great restaurant.
Best chain Italian food spot in charlotte so far..
Waiting for this Thai Fusion place to open. Service was outstanding..we had so many servers come and check on us and make sure we had everything we needed. We started out with a couple of rolls  and some Thai Fried Beef Jerky.
The Fire Cracker roll was really good..Nice size for sharing and delicious! The Beef Jerky was  well flavored but some of the pieces were inedible..way to tough and chewy. Then we ordered the Panther roll...Soft shell crab - which I adore - but alas it was fishy. 
We had the Basil Chicken and let me tell you ..it was spicy..only a 2 on a 5 scale but I am a hot eating person and it was very hot..Very delicious..needed perhaps lettuce to wrap it in. Nice size portion also. Our last item was Crab Fried rice. Not fishy but nothing special. I think they will fine tune everything..I would go back and have that Basil Chicken again and try a few other things..that sounded really interesting. The Service- Like I said..especially a great Waitress named Howdy, was fantastic!!
Schwarmas are one of those things which I think is just hard to screw up. 
You marinade the chicken, let it slow roast and shave it off.  How hard can it be?

Having driven by Nick's many a time, I tried it, and surprisingly, Nick's managed to disappointed me.

The combination of dry, under marinated chicken, boring toppings that were too cold, and average pita bread was underwhelming, and given the competition from other Schwarama places in the area (Pita & Grill, Paramount, etc.) it's hard to justify going back.

The chicken was dry and didn't have much flavor (maybe not enough marinade). 

The boring toppings  included garlic sauce (average - Pita & Grill's is much better), parsley, pickled beets, hummos, tomatoes, lettuce and banana peppers.  The toppings also seemed a bit cool, causing a strange contrast between the warm chicken and toasted pita. 

Pricing was similar to other establishments in the area, $5.99 for a chicken or beef schwarma. 

I'm not trying to rip on this place too hard. I will say their portions are better than Paramounts, which serves a tiny sandwich but has better taste. I'd be hard pressed to recommend this place, especially given Pita & Grill and paramount are 30 seconds - 2 minute drives away.
This place is phenomenal. 12-courses? Heck yeah! Heed other Yelper's warning. There will be so much food. 

I made reservations for dinner here on New Year's Eve. The service is impeccable. We were constantly being check by our servers making sure everything was to our liking. 

A few changes to the menu based on the other Yelpers who tried this place before me. They included Salmon on their Teriyaki and removed the Baked and replaced it with Vegetables (Asparagus or Broccoli). 

Here are the dishes that really stood out for me (good and bad): 

1. Garlic Edemame: Way better than the regular one or the Pepperoncini. Do not think the pepperoncini will taste anything like the pickled peppers. It was just edemame with chili flakes.

2. Super-White-Tuna & Scallop Carpaccio: These were delicious! They tasted fresh and sweet which was really a surprise to me because I personally do not like raw food but I totally made an exception with this one. 

3. Hamburger: Okay, this one is pretty weird and even our server admits it. I feel like it should not be part of the 12 course dinner. I'm guessing this is for people who do not really like sushi\/raw fish so they can have an option. But this seriously left me dumbfounded. It is a full burger meal with fries and everything. It was not until after I finished the burger that out of curiosity, I asked if it can be changed to the other burger options (Teriyaki, Takashi, Teriyaki Tsukune, Salmon Fry Burger) and they said yes but it will be an additional charge. Good to know for future reference.

4. Beef Sukiyaki: This was really delicious. The soup was a little sweet to my taste but the beef was so tender that I still loved the dish over all. Definitely get this over the Diced Steak. The steak was dry and the flavor was peppery so I was not really a fan of that. Plus who wants hard steak anyway?

5. Corn and Egg Soup: I would recommend something else rather than ordering this. I was pretty disappointed with it. A little too sweet too.

After two hours of battling against food, I am proud to say that I finished. They should really give some sort of medal\/award to people who can actually finish. That was a lot of food! Next time I come back, no more 12-course meal. I would come back to order little bits of things that I liked. 

Thank you, Chef Takashi. That was definitely a good way to end my 2015.
I've only been here for weddings but their food is delicious! Raw oyster bar is where is at! The prime rib was perfectly cooked and the potatoes were great. Servers were attentive and professional- what you would expect and hope for from a venue of this caliber. My only complaint is that the wedding venue is connected to the bar, separated only by stained glass, so we heard hollering from a sports game over the wedding ceremony. Bartender was great and offered me fresh coffee with baileys, even though baileys wasn't up on the display counter. If I had the money I would've gotten married here too!
Let me start off by saying that I can't wait to come back here. I love all the starters and tiny buns - oh and lets not forget about the milkshakes! Okay okay - I am getting ahead of myself..let's start at the beginning.

I came here with a co-worker and we decided to get a bunch of plates to share. We had the following (listed in order by favorite):

1-Lobster Mac & Cheese - Lump chunks of lobster in a decant creamy mac and cheese sauce. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

2 - Pizza Twinkie - mozzarella cheese and pepperoni in a twinkie type of dough - deep fried with tomato dipping sauce. Grown up pizza rolls - Yum!

3 - Fried Pickles - Nothing more to say - they speak for themselves.

4 - Lobster Filet Tiny Bun - Two tiny burgers that are made with filet mignon and topped with lobster. 

5 - Blue Cheese Kettle Chips with French Onion Dip - These were a bit average. Would not get these again. I could have bough the chip and made the onion dip at home for the same or less price.

We then moved on to the best part...the HUGE milk shakes (
I couldn't even finish it and I love me some ice cream :-) Try to Oreo or Pumpkin - Out of this world delicious!!
DO NOT EXPECT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE (they never smile and always rush you and can be forgetful with drinks) ... 

BUT what they lack in service they make up for in DELICIOUS FOOD. Expect long waits. Order ahead... Make them repeat your order, pick up or dine in, but not delivery. I've going for years and only once was I given a smile at the Decatur and Sahara location.  She made our day and got a nice Tip :)
I came here with a group of about seven people for dinner to try something new - Yakitori! 

The restaurant is fairly small with a bar taking up about one half of the space. It's a dimly lit interior with a bit of a rustic Asian feel. 

The menu is quite extensive including bibimbap, side dishes, and grilled dishes with some unique offerings. I decided to play it fairly safe and I ordered the following items:

1) Black Tiger Shrimp Grill - this came with four decently sized pieces of shrimp that were cooked well, but were not particularly flavourful and weren't  too special 
2) Vegetable Jap Chae - this is a dish of sweet potato noodles and vegetables. I didn't like it very much. I found it to be pretty oily and flavourless. It also didn't come with many vegetables and was mainly just slivers of onions with a few pieces of peppers and a few pieces of mushrooms. I wouldn't get it again.

Others ordered the vegetable skewers which looked good. I found it interesting that they came with pieces of corn on the cob. Some of the other meat pieces that my friends ordered looked a little sparse. For example, the chicken skewers didn't look like they came with much meat on them.

Service was sufficient, although we all noted that they could have been better at refilling our drinks. It was also a bit frustrating how there were sometimes significant time lags between when different people got their dishes (which may be just a feature of dining at a yakitori style restaurant), meaning that some people had finished their meals while others were just starting on theirs.

Ultimately we had a fun evening and my friends commented that they would return, but we wouldn't rush back, and I would not consider it a group favourite.
I went in here today and cannot agree more with the first reviewer.  I actually live a few miles north of here and have access to several grocery stores, but I would much rather buy local and support a business helping the neighborhood...but this is not about me!

The store has lots of staple grocery items like pasta, peanut butter, condiments, snacks, etc.  But what is really great are all of the local items like salsa, honey, bread, hummus, and a nice variety of local produce.  Everything is great quality and very reasonably priced, even the specialty and 'gourmet' items.  I hope a lot of folks support this store so it stays in business.
We had tickets for the Cirque Du Soleil show "O" which is at Bellagio Hotel so we decided to have their buffet for dinner. It was already holiday pricing, so dinner was $44.95 (regularly $36.99 USD) on a weeknight. We are not buffet people since we prefer quality over quantity. Luckily there was not much of a wait at 6:30pm and we were able to justify the price since they served king crab legs. It is served cold but you can ask them to heat it up. Also, when there is no line up, you can ask the servers to give you a plate full instead of grabbing it at the counter. They also served snow crab legs, mussels, and shrimps as other seafood choices. They had a good variety of food from a large dessert table, to a sushi bar which served handrolls and decent poke, a few meat carving stations including prime rib and rack of lamb, a salad bar, a pasta and pizza station, Chinese food, and a taco bar.
A friend and I ended up eating here since my iPhone needed repaired and the store was pretty much right next door, and we were in the mood for Thai, anyway.  This place has a cool vibe, and the bar\/wine rack provide some nice touches, as well.  The food itself came pretty quickly, and was very delicious.  The servers were quite courteous.  I never got to the bottom of my water glass!  We didn't get to experience the live musician other reviewers mention, but we'll be back at some point to this venue...
The price is right and so is the location. Cookies were ok but not mind blowing good. I tried the double chocolate chip, chocolate chip walnut and chocolate chunk. The chocolate chunk was by far the best of the three. There was a lot of choco chunks and they were still a little gooey. Yum! I wasn't that big of a fan of the chocolate chip walnut. There were lots of walnuts on top but the cookie was almost cakey with not enough choco chips. The double choco cookie was fine. A bit flat, in flavor and literally. For around 65 to 70 cents per cookie, go check it out for yourself.
I have to confess, the Flame was my lunch's bridesmaid today. I started my lunch drive heading in the direction of a seeming recent yelpers' hang, intent upon adding my two cents to the flood of reviews. 

Lesson one. . . read not only the reviews, but also the hours of operation. Not only was my bride not open for lunch. . . but it was also not open on Tuesdays at ALL. 

Disappointed, I turned for home, wondering what I'd have for lunch since I'd been focused to the point of excluding any other potential venues from consideration, when I decided on The Flame. I like barbecue, pulled pork, etc, and it sounded good. 

I've eaten at The Flame (or rather ordered from then taken out) several times, and always enjoyed it, but this was my first visit with an eye toward "reviewing it". 

Unfortunately this was not my best visit. Waitstaff (the lady behind the counter) seemed not to be having a great day. Though she wasn't outright hostile, neither did she make any attempt to welcome me to The Flame, saying simply, "Did you order for pickup?" and at my negative response, "What can I get you?" I think that, and the amount owed (upon collecting my food to go) was the extent of our dialog. 

I decided to jump on the Mac 'n' cheese 'n' insert food item bandwagon and ordered the Stock o' Mac with pulled pork, and a side of sweet potato fries. I love me some sweet potato fries. 

I collected my plastic shopping bag and left the 'welcoming' fires of the barbecue behind. 

The Stack o' Mac was good. Really good, honestly. Upon initial inspection it looked like nothing so much as a pile of pulled pork on top of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Deluxe despite indications of home made mac'n'cheese. It was sooo much better than Kraft. I guess I'm not sure what I was REALLY expecting from homemade mac and cheese. That it would LOOK like the noodles were homemade? Stupid. It was velvety and sharp and delightful and upon further review, surprised me that the sole criticism of it was that there wasn't more of it, since what I'd really been drawn to was not so much the macaroni, but the pulled pork. The portion size was a tad smaller than I'd have liked. It's not a huge criticism, because I probably don't NEED to be eating more than what was given, and there was a hefty bunch of pulled pork on top of it. . . but I liked it more than I thought I would, and I think it would have balanced out the dish a little if there'd been more of the great mac 'n' cheese. 

The sweet potato fries were also good, but "floppier" than I prefer. I like a nice crisp fry. But these had great skin-on, earthy, sweet flavor, and when I got home and dipped them in a little Sweet Baby Ray's (cause that's how I roll) they were very tasty and I found that relative to the total experience my disappointment with the texture was pretty minor. 

Cost wise, it's not a bunch to spend. $10.86 for lunch. But this is Millvale. Relative to the surroundings and what the neighboring establishments charge. . . it actually seems sort of spendy. I expect, for example, to drop $15.00 or more for lunch in Pittsburgh on any given day (with tip). But Millvale? There was no tip to worry about, but also no drink. Seemed like a bit much for a bit too little. 

Overall, I'll definitely be back. I don't think I'd counsel anyone to undertake a journey to visit, but certainly if you're in the area and have a hankerin' for pulled pork or chicken wings, it's a good venue.
He was very helpful in dealing with our tenant. He explained everything in detail. We are very happy that we found him and were able to use him during this difficult time. We highly recommend him!
Love coming here. Yes the place always needs the floor swept but when you give out  peanuts in the shell how won't it always be a bit dirty. 

The food speaks for itself, so good. Burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich. Getting the small burger just means 1 patty, the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness. 

Getting the Cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries (a lot more fries) into the bag.
The Seafood buffet inside the Rio hotel is a popular one on the strip. (actually, it is not on the strip, but a block on the other side of Highway 15)

It costs $39.95 per person. If the line is really long, you can pay $49.95, or ten dollars more, and get in the express VIP line and get in with little wait. 
This is what I did, because I was meeting some friends who were here 15 minutes before me because I was running late. 

(Note: The Las Vegas strip traffic is HORRIBLE on a weekend evening! You might move faster on the SF-Oakland Bay Bridge at 8am, or the I-405 past LAX at 5:30pm)

The buffet has a huge selection to choose from, and of course a lot of it is seafood. Their are king crab legs, several types of fish in various styles, shrimp, clams, mussels, oysters, clam chowders (New England and Manhattan), sushi, sashimi, etc. 

Of course, there are offerings that are not seafood, so the meat lover can get something to fill his\/her tummy.

A lot os desserts or course, of all sorts. 

I would caution that you be careful with the shellfish,  as it is sitting under hot lights and if they don't move fast, well, you could get some uncomfortable gurgling deep in your gastro-intestinal tract.  The sushi seemed to move faster, so it seemed ok. 

Your waiter gets you drinks, and general they are good about refills, because they want their tips from you, so leave one for your server if they are giving you good service.
Um, so... I don't actually like Chinese food. Not, like, I absolutely won't eat it - I'd just never choose it myself. I came here for Paddy H's birthday and so, I should preface this review with that, and state that my twenty-ish quid for the unlimited banquet would have been better value if I'd actually dug into everything properly instead of tentatively nibbling and then just waiting for more chicken dumplings to arrive. It's already not cheap as meals go, even all-you-can-eat ones.

However, my rating is based entirely on the experience as a whole and not my own personal foodie preference (because that would be just daft). Besides, I was informed by the gentleman on my left, who had spent no small amount of time living in China, that what we were indulging in was in fact extremely good, albeit the geographic and cultural equivalent of serving linguine, sangria, falafel and bratwurst on the same table.

I believe I've mentioned my tapas hesitancy before - how I cling desperately to my favourite thing and guard it, snarling, from others' hands. This is also a large part of my problem with Chinese meals. This is not, however, a problem with the Chop Chop banquet - you can simply ask for more! MORE! MOAAAAAAAR!

Simultaneously the good and bad side to this is that everything is made fresh to order, so if you don't ask well before you've finished what's already on the table, you're left sitting for a goodly while before more sails toward you. And, in the case of my beloved chicken dumplings, you might have to ask a couple of times. Given the size of the place and the number of replenishing orders they must take from people, it's unsurprising and somewhat forgiveable that the occasional order goes astray.

The staff were efficient, if not overly friendly, and attended our table frequently. The real highlight for me, though, was the glittery tables. Just like Christmas in my mum's kitchen! Red glitter everywhere, yay!

So - it's just fine, and on nights of better service this is a definite four-star place, but my own experience on this occasion, with some hyper-extended waits combined with a fairly high meal price, registers at a positive three.
Standard Chinese food for a low price.
I like seeing Steve Adler pa he is funny and knowledgable. The place has been turning into a factory over the last few years packed lobby and everyone seems to be unhappy and running behind. They also treat you like you are a tweaker when it comes to prescribing medication. I have a life long injury and require prescription medication to function at 100 percent. I would not go here if my primary doctor could just prescribe meds long term. They are expensive too. Bring a magazine if it is your first visit they have nothing but chairs. Also plan on 1.5 to 2 hours for you total visit. The first 30 mins will be your filling out clip boards crap. The second 30 will be waiting to get in. 5 mins will be your dr time or more than likely pa visit. Then you go back and wait 30 mins for you prescription papers.
one of my favorite bbq chicken place in montreal...i actually dreamt of it when i lived in LA! Stay away from the fries ...they are so awesome you can't just eat a few!!!
Romados for me is to chicken what Shwatzes is to smoke meat!!!
I recently discovered this Korean restaurant and now it's one of my faves. Everything is so good including the seafood pancake, their hotstone bowls, and a highlight is definitely their bbq. They use only the best meats that are local and organic.  You can definitely tast the difference. Their menu is big so lots to try and there is plenty of seating.
This is the best ice cream place in Pittsburgh!!!  They have many flavors, many mix ins, sprinkles, dips, multiple sundae options and snow cones. The variety is endless! The line is usually long, but goes  quickly and is well worth the wait... Every time. This place is consistently great!
I am very impressed!!!!! One of my dogs has recently become very sick needing several exams and medications. Dr. Ainsworth has been extremely thorough, caring, sincere, knowledgable and personable. He truly makes you feel like he is treating your pet as if it were his own. We eventually had to go see a different office for radiologic services, but Dr. Ainsworth made sure to stay updated on Max by calling the other vet and myself to check on him and remain involved in his care. He even went above and beyond by calling around to compare prices of meds to make sure we were getting the best deal. 
The entire staff from the receptionists to the techs are also great!!!
I'd been warned that Brit & Chips wasn't all it was cracked up to be, but being in the area closer to 8 p.m., I decided that it was too late to venture farther for food.  I should have kept walking.

I ordered the Orange Crush Hake and Chips from the counter, since it wasn't immediately apparent if it was a place with table service, but when the order was put in for takeout, I quickly asked if I could eat there instead.  The cashier (and server as I soon found out) was  obliging and quickly told the cooks that it was eat-in.  The whole transaction was in French (which can often make a difference in Montreal).

The service was remarkably fast in getting the food to the table, but after that, the experience went downhill.  Although it looked great to start with, the food was incredibly bland, no matter how much lemon and tartar sauce I used.  I was okay that the server ignored me the whole time I was there (the "extra mile" would have been to offer water and check in).  With eating out in restaurants much more frequently, I'm inclined to tip generously for good service (because the difference has become much more apparent), but I'll only do that on the way out when I've judged the service.  I don't feel like anyone really did a good job, and when they all ignored me on the way out, suddenly I wasn't inclined to part with any more money.  (I totally had it ready in my pocket for the tip basket too.)

When I left, I felt a funny feeling in my throat (definitely from the food), but today it's actually a full-blown sore throat.

I usually give glowing reviews but this restaurant needs the feedback.  I think people will be more forgiving of bad food if the service is great, but usually those go hand in hand, so maybe the staff have given up.  And even if that was a one-off night, a customer in the restaurant is still a person with money to part with, right up until they leave your establishment.
Just about every one loves The Jersey Boys. 

It is a great musical odyssey in the life stories of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, who grow up from their youth and learn to "Walk Like a Man". 

You have a score based on all the hits of the Four Seasons and later of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, from "Sherry" to "Maryann".  The staging is surprisingly simple, with a clever bare bones set that still allows all the scene changes to occur quickly and creatively, with the help of lights and costuming. 

The cast is excellent, with a talented group of main characters and just as talented satellite characters. 

If you like good music, or remember the many Four Season or Frankie Valli hits, you will love this show! 

The Jersey Boys:
You're just too good to be true, 
Can't take my eyes off of you

PS - if you mind your kids hearing F bombs, don't bring them!
As a doula in the Valley I go into quite a few Doc's offices. It is always a wonderful experience to go to visits with my clients at Desert Perinatal. The staff is courteous, the nurses are wonderful, and the docs? The best in the valley at what they do. Period. End of story. ALL of the docs there are awesome, and rest assured, the care you receive will be top shelf. If you find yourself in a high risk pregnancy, DPA is the place to go!
Oh baby you... Got what I neeeeeed... Trader Joe's, West Elm, Best Buy, Staples, Marshalls, Boutique stores, restaurants... I wish I lived above in the condos! For those of us that need to visit the Met, the parking is atrocious during peak times.
Tiffany was our waitress. She really  does her job well! Very helpful and seemed to really enjoy what she does. So nice to see someone so happy and smiling. Great food!
Love this place!

Peggy is great with dogs and does a great job! She is very patience with him and will make any adjustments you need before you leave the store. My little guy has no problems coming here.

They also have very good bully sticks (the non-smelly ones) that my little guy and his friends love!
I'm so fed up with this service center. In the beginning they were wonderful but have declined over the years. I can't get calls returned, when they follow up on a service appointment and I voice the problem they say they will call me back and never do. I've inquired about additional warranty, repairs, etc, and promised calls which I never receive. Simultaneously the sales department solicits heavily through mail, email, and by phone.

My most recent complaint is I'm traveling and my coolant light came on. I was 40 miles from the closest BMW service center in freezing conditions and they wouldn't give me a recommendation of what aftermarket coolant I could put in my car. I asked to talk to a different representative and they transferred me to the parts department, who never picked up the call. I called back and asked again for someone different, they just sent me back to the same uncooperative service manager. Their customer service is terrible. It certainly doesn't make me want to give them any more business.
Love this store!  Don't always have much luck with the sales, but I always find something I like here.  This isn't your average Marshall's or TJ Max.  I think the green dress I'm wearing is from Filene's!
This restaurant has generated some hype but the food doesn't live up to it. I've been to Lebanon, so nothing can beat the heavenly hummus made in its region of origin. The piping hot bread at H Factory hits the spot but the hummus is just average. The kafta was dry unfortunately, the chicken shawarma lacked authentic spices and was a mess to eat. The zucchini fries were a hit but there is better hummus, sharwarma and koobideh elsewhere in Vegas.
So fun and a ton to see! I've been twice now and Roosevelt Street is definitely the most jumping area with great people watching, areas to walk around, street performers, and open galleries. There is a section with food trucks and art booths too. 

The second time I attended I parked at Heard Museum and took the free trolley to Roosevelt. It was cool to see all the stops along the route -- but it took longer than expected. I didn't hit any of the smaller stops but I'm looking forward to checking out some of the smaller galleries next time. Also, if you're taking the trolley, be sure to keep track of the time because the last pickup is at 9:30pm even though the event doesn't end until 10pm. 

My recommendation is to arrive early (around 5:30) so you avoid traffic, get good parking and have ample time to explore. Also, there's no way you can check out all the spots in one evening so pick 1-2 small galleries or large museums during one visit and stick to exploring Roosevelt, which will easily keep you entertained all evening, on another visit.
To celebrate our anniversary, my boyfriend and I decided to go somewhere nice for dinner. We made a reservation and were seated as soon as we arrived. The booth they gave us was very spacious. Our server was very attentive and we continued to recieve great service throughout our dining experience. We were there about two hours so it's definitely a "dining experience". 

For an appetizer, we had to try this table side mozzarella because we kept hearing such amazing things! The server who made it was really friendly and showed us "newbies" what it was all about. We got to choose what kind of salt we wanted and if we wanted oil. We chose the Hawaiian salts, which were great! I would definitely say the mozzarella was the hit of the night for us! For dinner, I ordered the swordfish and my boyfriend ordered the short rib. Both were very delicious and would recommend! We took the chocolate cake with raspberry sauce home with us to share. The cake was very rich but good! Overall, I would recommend Tanzy. For us, it was definitely an indulgence (food and money wise) but we enjoyed out time at the restaurant.
This has to be one of the worse times I've been to a restaurant.  I made reservations for Saturday evening at 8pm.  I booked it through opentable and it was confirmed via email.  So, I swung by the restaurant around 8pm.  Upon going into the restaurant, I was surprised to see no host\/hostess at the front.  There is no podum or table.  When you walk in, your basically standing the dining area already. I basically saw waiters and waitresses walking back in forth from the kitchen to the various patrons eating.  They seemed to so busy.

 I was standing there, staring down and patiently waiting for someone to service me.  I was approached by 2 people stating that a hostess will be with me shortly.  I waited there for about 15 minutes and no one to seat me down.  

I couldn't wait any longer, so I just took off and vowed never to return to this restaurant again.  I don't understand why any waiter couldn't just go flag the hostess down to take care me.  If the hostess could not be found, they should of atleast sat me down, especially when your standing there for a while.

There are plenty of other restaurants in the city that I spend my money on, never again will I go here.  I didn't even get past step 1, sitting down!
Best churros in Toronto imo. Really melts in your mouth when its fresh, otherwise its crunchy and good. Get the $5 for three filled churros for best value. Filling available: dulce de leche, condensed milk, chocolate, strawberry. Dulce de leche is probably the best one.
Can't believe I forgot to review this when I went in November...  Amazing mojito, thanks to the very awesome bartender there!  I can't remember his name, but both of the bartenders there were super friendly.  I had a big veggie burrito, and it was very very delicious.  Next time I'm at the Hard Rock, I'll definitely plan on coming here to eat!
Great burgers. Just make sure you tell them how you want your burger cook.
Overall terrible experience. We were sat inside and the space is very cramped and LOUD. The server we had was absolutely the worst sever I have ever had. Many empty drinks glasses, never asking how our food was and just completely ignoring us. We will not be returning to this restaurant again. Avoid this place at all costs.
We went here to watch the World Cup final. Luckily enough Spain won, because the place was 99% spanish fans.

I can't speak to dancing shows, maybe they are nice. But I would caution anyone coming here just for food and drink. The food was fine, but nothing special, however service varied between slow and rude. They simply weren't organised.

There is a general sense of neglect about the place -- in the upstairs nightclub, the stalls in the men's washroom don't lock, and one doesn't even have a block on the door, so there's no way to even hold it shut with your hand. Plus the washroom smelled like piss before anyone had used it. 

In another example, when they turned on the projector so we could watch the football, it said "replace lamp". Their solution was simply to reset the projector. It worked throughout the game, sure, but wouldn't it be better to actually replace the lamp? I feel that if the owners really cared, they would fix minor things like this. It doesn't speak well of them that they haven't.
I am delighted that Bridges came into my life to save me from my dysfunctional closet.  It was a cluttered mess, with clothes, shoes, and accessories stuffed into every inch.  I couldn't find anything, and ended up buying multiples of several items.  Bridges brought her high energy and enthusiasm to this task.  Applying her great suggestions for organizing the closet ( and keeping it that way), in just a few hours she created a streamlined, efficient closet with room for everything.  Now that I have a functional closet, I am motivated to apply her techniques to other cluttered areas.  Thanks so much, Bridges.  You are awesome!
Tried this place out because I was in the area. Expected the food to be great but it was not good at all. I got pad Thai with beef and crab puffs. The beef was so tough and couldn't even chew it and also the they wrapped the crab puffs in a egg roll wrapper. Who does that?? Will not be coming back to this place! Go to Chon Thai food on Dobson and warner, the food is amazing and staff so friendly!
I finally have decided to stop in here after driving past it nearly everyday. The interior looked much nicer than I expected before I entered the restaurant. There is a small ramen bar in front of the kitchen and a small Japanese themed dining area. The staff were all very friendly and the restaurant appeared to be very clean.

The food and the service was better than average. I would definitely recommend giving this place a go.

Takoyaki - this was excellent. If you like the Japanese dish Okino Miyaki then you will like this dish. It is basically the same ingredients and then it is shaped in to bite size portions.

Crispy Rice with spicy tuna - this is just what it says it is. It was good.

Crispy Chicken with ponzu sauce - This would have been a good choice if the chicken would not have been so greasy. I think the oil in the fryer needed to be changed or they dropped the chicken back in the fryer after it was cooked.

Spicy chicken ramen noodle - the ramen was excellent. I ordered it "Hot". It had a lot of heat to it, but not so much heat that you could not enjoy it. I may just go with "Spicy" next time though.
I have to tell you, after traveling through Southeast Asia eating a lot of noodles, dumplings, and all kinds of delicious food imaginable, I am on a mission to she'd some pounds so it was great that I was able to order their lobster lettuce cup and have it for dinner (minus the fried wonton chips and sauce) and have it be low calorie, delicious, full of flavor and filling!  
My son had their hummus platter and needless to say, he also loved his dish!  
All at happy hour prices. My bill came to less than $20. Gotta love that!
You know what differentiates a lot of tomato based Mexican food from fucking Italian? Oregano and basil, both of which were in your "hot" salsa today. I put quotation marks around that because I guess it was supposed to be spicy but it tasted more like sloppy joe mix than chiles. I didn't ask for a freakin' Mexitalian burrito.

Consistently the worst pseudo-Mexican food in the business. 

The best thing that can be said for it is it'll form a turd. Pure fuel, not food.
Beau restaurant situé au centre - ville. L'intérieur est convial . Le service était rapide et efficace et la nourriture tant qu'à elle était savoureuse .
this place is alright not as good as the other locations.. the servers aren't too attentive, this place can be busy and crowded .. i ate here twice already and it hasn't change my mind to add another star since i did a pick up right before work .. they showed what i got and i said ok .. and while i got to work i found no utensils and syrup for my french toast i was pissed i mean i dont eat it plain .. i paid this much and i get crappy ass french toast!

i'm not that type of person who would let go i mean the stuff they got aint cheap .. i called, the lady on the phone wasn't that nice what kind of service they got coz the way she talk to me she has no class and i work for food and i handled people over the phone better ! she got me mad because she was like "i cant do anything other than you come back for the syrup" like wth is that .. you want me to waste my goddamn gas when im already at work .. she doesn't know how to take care customer concern when in the first place its her fault to put no syrups inside the bag and even utensils smh .. i gave one star coz i told her to give the phone to the manager atleast this lady apologize and gave me 20% off for next pick up purchase but idk if i am since the server doesn't know how to do there jobs ..

Pro-tip... Park on Level 2 and use the stairs!
Wings are great, just wish you could order smaller sizes of them. Hoagies are huge but need more meat. The pizza is always good- only pizza I like around here!
I would reconsider taking a family member to Spring Valley Hospital. Unfortunately if you have an emergency and can't communicate then your probably going to be shit out of luck. Here is the event: I took my elderly family member to the ER for a possible broken hip from a fall during the night. Upon arriving at the ER, the service was horrible! The admin staff checking sick people in said to a colleague, "that unless there is someone needing CPR and will die they can all wait"! This was shocking as the ER had maybe 5-6 people in there. Once we were brought back hours later and she had an X-ray it clearly identified a fracture in her femur close to the hip joint knuckle. So they set surgery for the next day at 5pm. In the mean time the over dosed her on Benadryl, she couldn't speak and was starring at the ceiling and reaching through the air for whatever she was seeing. I called for a nurse which took upwards of 15 minutes to come, it actually looked like my 92 year old family member was dying. I went out of the room to find no nurse around except some guy on the phone bullshitting with the person on the other end of the line. I might add I hit the patient alarm too.  Finally the nurse came in and I brought my concerns to her attention and she started guessing what could have caused reaction. She said she would turn up the IV and flush it out of her system, while she laid there like a zombie. She was finally taken to surgery the next day where we sat for 3 hours in the OR waiting RM only to find out she had already been to recovery and taken back to her room upstairs, with not notification from the doctor or nurses. I had to flag down a nurse just to find out what was going on as our minds were racing thinking the procedure didn't go well. Now back in her room, the nurse's level of attention to detail was horrible, with the exception of a couple nurses, but still horrible. Apparently they found a blockage in her stomach and had to put a tube through her nose to release the fluids from her stomach only to have placed the tube in the wrong area for the past 24-30 hours. My 92! Year old family member has laid in her bed for going now on 3 days without any food or water. She is only being hydrated via IV. When the nurses are asked questions, they have no answers and the doctor is never around to ask him\/her anything either. The place is pathetic and I strongly recommend if you have time to pursue another place for your family's and or your well being, do it! Spending my career as a first responder, I have to say this is without a doubt a hospital I will avoid from here on out!

10\/8. My elderly family member was sent next door to Kendred for therapy and while there, the doctor was concerned with the size of her stomach and sent her back over to SVMC. This time while at the hospital, my elderly grandmother was sitting in her urine and feces upon our arrival with the room smelling horrid. No nurses! No doctors! Just granny sitting in her feces. It is apparently time to notify the news station and let the greater Las Vegas area know to avoid sending you loved one to this hospital.  Their lack of attention to detail and professionalism not to mention their attitude and disrespect to our community is appalling.

I was starving!    I PAID. I ate.  I DID NOT DIE! 
I was in heaven.  Until..I got full.  And I will do it again.  Too bad I eat the same each time.   My loss, pizza addiction to the same thing every time I order is not only a psychological problem, but a taste bud problem too.  I admit I am addicted to their pizza.  Thank you Papa for feeding me!  I just wish it was free like when I was little!
Gushi specializes in karaage chicken, which is a Japanese style fried chicken so most of their dishes will contain their specialty. I have tried their Gushi original and skewer, my next choice would probably be takoyaki as the ones I have in Toronto so far have been quite disappointing.

*Gushi Original - $7.25: 
to be honest I'm not a fan of deep fried chicken, but I will always have a soft spot for chicken karaage. Unlike other versions of deep fried chicken, karaage is not greasy and will not make you feel gross or drowned in oil afterwards. The chicken karaage at gushi achieved just that, it was juicy with a crispy-light surface, while still remained succulent when cold.

The purple rice was alright, I found it to be cold and hard to eat :(. The rice can be bland for some people, however the karaage had a right amount of salt in the seasonings, with a hint of spiciness from the mayo sauce, when eaten in one bite it was a delicious combination! Although they didn't give me any lemon wedges, there was some ginger to refresh your palate so I can forgive that! :p

*Gushi Chicken Skewer - $6: 
The skewer was longer than an iPhone 6 Plus! (Yes sorry for the weird comparison, but I can't think of any other object to compare to lol).

Again, the skewer was juicy and delicious! I wished they served this with some lemon because I loveeee squeezing a liberal amount of lemon before eating karaage ;). It really helps to lighten the dish and kill any kind of gaminess of the chicken.
After much debate (we read many mixed reviews) we decided to eat at the cathouse. The food was good, not amazing, but good. We decided that we would share a bunch of mini meals. We got the glorified chips and onion dip, pigs in a blanket, fried mozzarella balls and mini cheeseburger. The mini cheeseburger was def MINI. We paid way too much for a cheeseburger that I could eat in basically one bite. I can't really comment on the drinks since we didn't have any (we were still way too drunk from earlier that day). The décor was something to see, but we didn't see that many girls. Almost everybody in the place was a guy and there were no waitress\/models playing the part of "the cathouse." The girls that I did see were wearing shorts and a button down shirt and there was no "show" to watch while eating. Overall I would not recommend it as a must see when in Vegas. Defiantly not what I expected.
I had a really fantastic experience with MDex's dental services. Went in for a simple check up and cleaning which was great from start to finish. Their clinic's registration system is all on a computer which is really cool and smooth to use. The service is polite and professional and there was great soothing music playing throughout the treatment. They were quick and clean and I'm looking forward to going back (as much as one does to see a dentist...)

Shout out to the great receptionists who helped me with my insurance paperwork and were really fun to chat with as I waited!
This cafe provided me with my first Ethiopian cuisine experience. It was delicious and I am eager to go back. The most impressive thing to me was their selection of vegetarian dishes. They had as many options as those with meat which I really appreciate (doesn't happen very often.) The service was great. You can tell this is a family run restaurant that cares about their patrons. The food is very reasonably priced which make it easy to try a variety of dishes. 

We started with the shorba which is a lentil based soup. This was probably my favorite part of the meal, it was absolutely delicious---satisfying and hearty. We also had the vegetable combination which had 5 different dishes served on the injera, a crepe-like bread you eat the main dishes with.

This is a fun way to eat (with your hands) and opened up a new world of foods for us! Can't wait to go back and devour a bowl of shorba.
AMAZING service by the lady at the information desk....so sad that I wasn't able to catch her name :(

She spent over 15 minutes looking up to make sure I got the right library card and explained the differences and benefits of the one that I got. I live in a new part of town and wasn't coming up on her system so she called two different places to get the info.

Then she went over all of the locations, found the one closest to me, and gave me the lay out of the library. She also made sure that I knew what the fines were for overdue books\/dvd's so I wouldn't have to pay anything ;) 

Now about this library, it is right off a busy street and I guess the shopping center that it's located in is pretty popular because parking was hard to find! The library is well maintained and seems fairly new! There is a pretty hardcore DVD selection and there are some actual movies that are fairly new (past 2 years)..... among all of the national geographic documentaries of course ;) 

I got some yoga DVD's and a great book on healing the body through food! Just goes to show you that they have a great variety of material in their system!
The only reason I give the bus station in Cleveland two stars instead of one is because of Kevin the Security Guard. I arrived at the station around 3:15am, because I missed the Megabus I was scheduled on by 9 minutes in New York. If you want to hear a long, gory tirade with shocking details, I can pm you. For the purposes of this review, however, I'll just touch on a few facts.

One fact is that the customer service skills are severely lacking at the Chester Avenue location. Martin Luther King Jr. once said something to the effect of this: "The greatest sin a man can commit against his fellow man is not to hate him, but to be indifferent to him--that is the essence of inhumanity." The quote is not verbatim, but you get the idea. The feeling one is left with after encountering staff at the Greyhound Bus Lines terminal is that of being treated with indifference. *Save for Kevin the Security Guard, whose attention to my questions and assistance in helping me get on the right bus at the right time were a G-dsend. Thank you Kevin. 

Another fact is that the station in Cleveland, while historic, also could benefit from a better air ventilation system\/exhaust fan near the restaurant area because of the fried food smell pervading the air. In addition, the station would be more welcoming to passengers if it had more comfortable seats. Without a blanket underneath your rear here, you will not be likely to tolerate sitting for more than a few minutes. At least I was not able to. 

I ran into a few friendly characters outside the building, and chatted about Kyrie, LeBron and Kevin Love for a bit with one of them. We agree next year is gonna be the big one.
I am not going to spend too much time on this review because it was just an average burger. It actually was pretty damn close to a whopper from Burger King. It was a good fast food burger, but it was not worth the drive from Summerlin.
This is our goto restaurant when the family wants to eat Italian food. Someone always gets the big rig with the sausage, a meat pizza, spaghetti and meatballs, and other great stuff. I never leave disappointed. The only reason why this doesn't get five stars is because of parking. I have never found a spot closer than a quarter-mile away. The competition for family restaurants and bars is great, and that eats into the available parking spaces. We don't mind though. We will definitely be back again. 
EDIT:
We're back!  
Picked up a couple of salads and garlic cheese bread for lunch.  The antipasto and pablo Picasso Mexican salads were HUGE!  We could only eat a third of each salad. This is my neighbor hood Italian food  joint.
After being scared away from Rock & Rita's, we ended up at this place, which was, if nothing else, quieter.

I'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they're really what earned the single star, because they were sweet, but the food was just horrible.

I ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich. I asked the server if it was processed cheese, or "real" cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what I was talking about. I tried to clarify by saying, "Is it like Kraft single slices, or deli cheese?" He said it was "good". This really should have been a sign and I could probably fault the waiter for this, since you SHOULD know what you're serving, but he was so sweet, I couldn't be mad!

My husband ordered a hot dog of sorts.

I asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad. There was not, but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway (no charge). I asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich.

Of course, my sandwich was made with plasticy, processed cheese, that was melted to the point of Cheeze-Wiz and was inedible. I took one bite of the sandwich and couldn't do another. I got regular fries, instead of sweet potato (didn't bother complaining, because I got the free salad, so whatever...like I said, nice server!) My husband's food was fine, although nothing special. They were good with the refills of our drinks.

Anyway, as nice as the servers were, it wasn't good. I would avoid eating here if I could.
It's a shame I don't even know the name of the Dr. Who took care of us but he is a pro! I thought gingivectomy was supposed to be painful but no! He numbed 1\/2 of my mouth in less than a minute. I've received local anesthesia from several dentists before, but no one was never this good. The procedure was smooth and quick. I usually fear to go back to the dentist but I can't wait for my next appointment. On the other note, they are running 1800\/implant which I think is reasonable.
Eating at Mambo's was a pleasant surprise.  Six friends and I went there and everyone was delighted with their meals.  None of us had eaten Dominican food before and we relied on our waitress for suggestions.  Three of us had the steak with onions and red and green peppers which had wonderful flavor.  One had a chicken dish that was sort of a stew and the loved it. Two had a shrimp dish they raved about, and one had a variety appetizer dish.
The portions were more than adequate and the prices are moderate.  The service was attentive.  This was a hit on all counts and my friends and I will be back and will recommend it to others.  The menu has pictures of the various dishes which helps in ordering, especially if you are not familiar with the cuisine.
This is actually a really nice club. Comfortable seating, standard food, free drinks, and not many people.
Great service, comfortable atmosphere and food grossly overpriced! Would expect a steak of this value to be perfectly cooked. They got it right the second time. Will wait for a very SPECIAL occasion to retun.
Really tasty curry sauce. Grilled chicken was really flavourful and tender.  Cashier was very friendly and helpful as to what to order.  Perfect lunch size portion and coleslaw was good too to balance the curry spice.

Too bad about the location, didn't even know there was a food court in this building! Building should advertise outside to promote foot traffic.
Best Bang for your buck. excellent quality of work. He really knows his stuff  can't get any happier with his service. I always leave with 100% satisfaction every single time.
Food was amazing as was our waiter Anthony. I will definitely be back. I highly recommend this restaurant. Some of the best food I have had in scottsdale!
I hesitate to update my review since my previous review was very detailed. I just have to write that please read both!!!

I've been lucky, I can write that I've prob have has hundreds of massages, including daily massages in Southeast Asia when I was fortunate enough to travel through this massage Mecca for 4 months. And I tell you, Ireny's massages surpasses all of them!

Not an exaggeration. Yet, a relaxing massage is not the same as a therapeutic massage that heals you when you are in pain and cannot left your left arm and your left half of the body is frozen for instance. Well, Ireny can do BOTH!!!  Again, not an exaggeration!

I don't know what happened.  Somehow I had kinked my body while putting away the dishes the night before. I feel the pain and went to bed feeling discomforted. When I woke up the next morning, I could not left up my left arm- not even an inch without excruciating pain!!!  By the hour, my left side of the body was spasming in pain and I was barely able to walk. 

I thought of Ireny and I called her- luckily she answered the phone herself and I was able to go in the same day in the afternoon. When I showed up, I was a sorry sight!!!

I was in soooo much pain, barely able to drive myself over to her spa. Then I struggled to get my clothes off. I told Ireny my ailments then trusted myself to her hands. 

And did she work me through!  She took her time and very carefully manipulated and massaged different areas of my body to release the stress and tension. There were moments when I didn't think I could do what she was asking and she gently coaxed me through it. 

Throughout each movement, it was gentle and firm and just what my body needed because by the time she was done, I went from not being able to lift my left arm an inch to being able to lift it over my head!!!!

And within the last two weeks, not sure what is going on with my body, she has had to do this twice and both times I walked away stress free, pain free and renewed!!!!

I've joined their monthly program for the float\/massage combo cause it's worth every penny to me. To have a massage with Ireny first then float for meditation I am convince is going to add years to my life. 

The added caveat is that both Ireny and her son are soooo nice and down to earth, it's a great feeling for me to know I am supporting a locally owned business!!!

If you mention my name if you ever go in for a float or membership, I think I get a free float- so I will love you forever. 

Actually, once you've been there yourself after reading this review and the last one that I wrote, you will love me & Yelp forever!!!
I was really looking forward to trying this place after seeing that this was one of the few Thai restaurants in the area that had high reviews. Thai food happens to be one of my favorites and after trying this place, I was extremely disappointed. The food had absolutely no flavor at all. I was extremely disappointed in the mango sticky rice, the rice was very dry with no sauce. The Tom Kha soup I ordered had no flavor, tasted like salted coconut milk with chicken and noodles. Very disappointed. The only decent part of my order were the egg rolls and that was it. I feel like I wasted my money.
This is definitely my go to when I have a craving for sushi rolls. They have a great selection and they are so good. Also, be warned that most of their rolls are really big. Usually get quick and friendly service.
Never call this location for an order. When you arrive there they will deny they received it!! Then instead of service recovery they will claim that they never received the order and claim you are a liar. I gladly took my money elsewhere!!! The two men working 10\/12\/15 at 7pm are not working to make money nor satisfy customers!!
Well seeing that Sarah R. sort of beat me to the punch on the review haha there isn't much to say! I was absolutely astonished to find that this Target is a SuperTarget! That seems like a great achievement to have such a large store suspended above some parking. I don't know why... Furthermore, It is just getting off its feet so we can't say much on the matter. Being brand new I love the Gigantic target symbol in the parking structure. It almost silly it is so big haha. You walk over to a glass-encased "room" for the modern-age escalators and stainless steel stairs. They have all the same amenities as other super Targets, such as a cafe, a Starbucks, deli, etc. It of course was extremely clean (seeing that it had just opened) as you would expect. It also has a great location! It makes it easily accessible to the downtown residents as well as the college campus; college students love them Targets! It is a great looking store and a pretty unique one being held by stilts pretty much!
I ordered a rare ribeye steak and got an almost raw steak and not a lot of flavor, barely worth the $40 price tag
I was not very impressed with my experience at Lucky Moose. First, I did not like the fact that frozen food was being displayed on the outdoor porch. Granted it is winter and it is frigidly cold out so the goods would be unlikely to spoil, I just still prefer to see my frozen groceries in a freezer! There is a distinctly 'fishy' odor at the back of the store where they sell the fresh fish, but it's not even a normal fish-stall smell... it's not like when you pass the fresh fish stands at St. Lawrence Market. I did not find that the prices here were considerably better than nearby Sobeys or Metro, so I would definitely not return just to save money. Something else that was off-putting was the fact that they charge you $0.50 to use credit cards if you spend less than $30. I can understand it to some extent when stores want you to spend at least $10, but $30 is a bit steep in my opinion! Finally, surly does not even begin to describe the cashier I had - there was no customer service whatsoever!

I will not be returning.
they have some pretty interesting things here!

definitely a one-stop shop for cheese and bread =p

also carry a variety of pates that are pretty tasty!
I have gone here 3 times with my 3 different cars and each time, with each car, they say for x amount of money more they'll do this, this, and this which made the bill well over $100. So I feel like they are just conning people into more things than we probably need done. And every time I go, it's a different person in charge. So I would caution people on going and if you do go, stand your ground and only have done what YOU want done and refuse the rest
Decided to give this place a try based on the reviews. 

Service is really slow on a Thursday afternoon work day. It took almost 30 mins before we got our food. Definitely not the place to go during the work week.

Ordered a pork bone soup which was just ok. Nothing special or memorable about it.

Not sure if I would come back again.
The 51 is okay. I have found that while I enjoy it, it actually is never the quickest way to get anywhere I need to go, which is sad and unfortunate. 

However, I'm amazed at how many people are checking in on the 51. Maybe the highway patrol should be checking yelp to see where they need to start hanging out :)
Well, this is yelp and I have to write an update to what I have experienced. First of all, I want to clearly separate the instructors and instruction from the business side of Karate for Kids. I still think the instructors are great but the business side of this particular location to me is unethical. 
First, I bought four vouchers from livingsocial.com because on the voucher it said limit four per family. When I went to redeem the vouchers, they would not even honor the first one because right away they tried to hard sell me by telling me that I had to pay an enrollment fee of over $100 to start. Well, I refused because the voucher said clearly one month of unlimited karate lessons and a free uniform. 
So I got my son his first month of unlimited karate lessons plus uniform per terms of the voucher. 
They also told me it was meant for 4 (separate kids) per family even though it said nothing of the sort in writing on the voucher. 
When the first month ended, Karate for Kids begrudgingly "allowed" me to turn in the second voucher. By the end of the second month, my son was ready to go from white belt to orange belt and to my shock, they told me it would cost me $70 to pay for his belt. My son, who is five, was sitting right there waiting to graduate so I said I would pay the $70 because I did not want to disappoint him. Then one of the instructors continue to tell me in order for my son to graduate, I would have to pay the enrollment of over $100 plus $147\/ month (they were giving me a $40 credit for my remaining two vouchers) and after 2 months, my fee would go up to $187. He also told me that the vouchers were for a "special introductory class" where you were allowed to take one class a week for 4 weeks even though the voucher clearly said unlimited amount of classes for one month right on the voucher. Needless to say, my son did not graduate because the terms were outrageous. 
Karate for Kids when you log onto their website has no fees posted for a good reason. Because once you walk into their door, they try to hard sell you into the highest membership possible. If you refuse, they tell you they are holding a special karate class on a Sat morning and invite you to attend with your child. Once you are there, they try to get you to pay for a year of fees upfront with discount, of course. During this time there are no mention of other additional fees like $70 per belt or any other fees. 
I think a lot of parents once they are roped in because they've paid for a year worth of classes upfront just pay these other outrageous fees because they feel like they don't have a choice. 
I can't believe no one has yelped about this. Well, I'm keeping it real and I'm yelping. 
I've also contacted livingsocial.com and filed a complaint that this particular location is not honoring the terms of the livingsocial vouchers. 
The truth is, if they would honor my vouchers per the terms they themselves printed on the vouchers, if they were clear and upfront with all their fees, I would most likely have my son continue taking their classes for years to come. But to have fees blindside me is hard for me to swallow. 
Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed that for a business where they teach the kids about respect, responsibility, honor, and honesty, that they have not shown respect, responsibility, honor, and honesty to me.
You know what? For what it is, this Showmars is top notch. A five star review doesn't = a five star restaurant experience of course, but if you want casual fast food in a clean environment, at a reasonable price and with polite staff, Showmars is the place to get it. 

The menu is interesting, a combination of casual Greek food, burgers and seafood. I've tried several of the Greek menu items, as well as the fish sandwich and the Calabash shrimp plate. Everything I've had has been top notch, but if I have to ding them for anything - and it's not enough to take off a star - they don't carry malt vinegar in the restaurant which seems a shame because that's all it would take for them to have a killer fish and chips meal!

My favorites are the crinkle cut fries, the hush puppies, their cole slaw, tzatziki and Greek salad. Every order I get fills at least one or two of those cravings.

Table runners are spot-on to refill drinks or get you anything you need. The only thing is I feel guilty about not leaving a cash tip, since there's no room to tip on a card at the register, and I go cashless almost 100% of the time. One of these days I'll pack a wad of singles into the console of my car so I can leave the table runners a buck or so for their fast and friendly service. As it is, I often sit close enough to the drink machine to grab my own refills and I self-buss my own mess. It's the former waitress in me coming out.

Good for singles, couples, families, lunch or dinner. Not a romantic joint, but doesn't try to pretend it is. You can even phone in an order and pick it up at their drive-thru window. Not much more you can ask for. Well, maybe a little malt vinegar...
Took my 3 month shi Tzu here for second time. I wasn't impressed with the puppy service, my puppy felt stressed and scared after the service. Also the trimmed my puppy received on his head was too short. The toe nails were not clipped properly as there were still a toe nails on each paws that was not clipped. I will not be going back there again.
When I decided to end my husband's habit of cutting up every past personal piece of paper in his life 100 times with a pair of scissors, I headed to Staples to get a shredder.  This store is large and well organized, with plenty of signage to help you find what you're looking for.  

Well, I found the shredder on sale with a mail in rebate (I hate those...).  In addition, I found a fire proof safe that we've been meaning to get and was on my way.....

Next stop, Target.  I happened to check the price of the safes there, and found the same brand of safe at the same size for $15 less!  15 dollars!!  That's kind of a big difference between stores.  

Now I have to go back to Staples and return the safe....bummer.
This place is the biggest joke and the reason why I hate random sushi places such as this. Yes I know Ginza has more than one location. How? I have no idea because their customer service is a joke. Their servers are nothing more than hostile people who absolute hate their lives and show their attitude to their customers. It takes over 1 hour to get your food at this place even when it's a simple order and there are two people in the restaurant and if you even call for pickup you have to wait over 20 mins as they put you on hold while the waiters decide to gossip with each other. 

I have been coming to this place for years because I live so close to it. But over the last three years that quality of the fish has really gone downhill and on top of that their customer service is horrendous. What kind of ownership does this place have that they can't control the attitude and complete disregard for their customers. Seriously be warned, unless you want crap service, crap quality of sushi, questionable atmosphere and unnecessarily sassy waitresses avoid this place like the plague. I would suggest New Generation which isn't too far from this location.
First time here.. I was a bit put off by all the food reviews but decided to try for myself. We were a big group ..I think 15 people so it was a bit stretched out for service time . The drinks were good! Ordered and Old Fashion made with Makers Mark... Everyone was pleased with their drinks. Appetizers were slow to come out, I ordered Avocado Eggroll but got to taste the Homemade chips which were great and the Jalopeno Poppers both of which were very good. I had the Turkey Burger, which had goat cheese in it .. It was small for the price and it was good.. not great but good. It seems like a cute place to go for a nice cocktail.. food is just average ..
Whoa, some of these reviews are mouth hanging open shocking to read! I've personally enjoyed every experience I've had here and will continue to return. Lunch time can be a bit crazy so just beware. Everything from the hummus, pitas and salads are delicious! I don't think I would call this place "Mediterranean" but it's good food. The tabouli salad I ordered today was gigantic and very tasty! All my co-workers who hadn't been before have loved it after a recommendation from myself. It can get a little pricey but to me isn't price difference wise to somewhere like Paradise Bakery. The food options are really good and I like that it's a healthier choice than some of the places around the area. I also love the Greek dressing they leave on the tables (which you can buy to take home as well). All in all, I am a fan and will keep returning!
I went for lunch today and was seated by a sweet you girl. My friend and I often go to Sushi Inn, but we decided to try Tokyo Kitchen for the first time as it is supposed to be very authentic Japanese food.

The restaurant itself is rather bare bones with limited decorations and plastic chopsticks and cups. The menu is also on the smaller side with fewer options than you may typically expect to find.

My friend ordered the special of the day which was beef teriyaki which came with rice, salad, and a croquette (fried potato ball with meat mixed in). I ordered a cucumber roll and the sunomono salad (seafood, seaweed, cucumber, and a sweet vinegar. The cucumber roll and salad came quickly and I decided to order a second order of the sunomono as the serving size appeared quite small. This second salad also appeared quickly. After waiting for about half an hour without any sign of my friend's food, we decided to inquire about it. It turns out that the waitress had not heard the order for the special of the day, so it had not been prepared. At this stage I was a bit confused about why the waitress had not come to check in on us earlier as we were sitting with three plates of untouched food in front of us for about 25 minutes (I had not touched my food as I was waiting for my friend to receive hers). Her plate came quickly after we fixed this mix up.

The cucumber roll was quite large (8 pieces) with a lot of rice and chunks of cucumber rather than the finely sliced slivers I typically expect. The seafood in the sunomono salad was crab meat and two pieces of shrimp. I found the dressing to be quite salty and one bowl contained considerably more dressing than the other. My friend said her beef teriyaki was good, although it wasn't an outstanding dish.

The smaller restaurant got rather busy during the lunch hour and the server was getting a bit overwhelmed as she was tending to everyone on her own. At one point, the female chef actually emerged from the back to bring out two dishes to patrons. 

Payment is also a bit confusing because some people paid at their tables whereas others went up to the counter to pay. We had to ask for our bill and the waitress asked us to come to the counter to pay.

Overall it probably is good authentic Japanese food, but I don't think I will be rushing back anytime soon. I was also disappointed that we were not offered complimentary green tea.
Little cafe on the east side of cave creek north of the 101 freeway.  We live nearby & enjoy the homey atmosphere with decent fresh food.

Last time I got the egg white bagel sandwich  ($7.99) on an everything bagel and a cup of fruit ($1.99).  I really enjoyed the avocado, egg white, ham and melted cheese.

My hunny got the green chili burger which he ordered medium but it was well done- of course.  He enjoyed the bread.

Minus 1 point for tchotchke hair ties and homemade baby clothes being displayed at hostess area.  This is not a boutique and I suggest you elevate your dining experience by ditching the dust collectors.
Take note that most of these dishes are tapa styles, meaning the portions are smaller. I really, really wanted to like this place as Eric was my favourite on Master Chef Canada, but my expectation felt short. The menu is definitely unique, but it was too overhyped and the majority of dishes didn't deliver. Also, the pricing is higher compared to other restaurants in the area, so I expected the quality of food to be reflect the premium paid. The service and ambience was nice, but I would suggest R&D as a restaurant for late-night snacks and drinks, as for dinner you might leave with a high bill and an ok-full stomach. 

-Pina De Nada $7: tasted a bit watery, not much flavour going on. The tapiocas were stale and had no flavour, I think it would have been nice if they were soaked in syrup, giving it a little sweet taste. 

-Lychee Cactus Pear Juice $6: I couldn't taste the cactus nor pear flavour, and this drink reminded me of the Lychee Aloe drink that you can buy at Asian grocery stores.

-CSB (BBQ pork buns) $8: instead of the steamed CSB, these were baked. This CSB has a perfectly crispy pastry encasing the delicious and tender BBQ pork. My complaint is that my server served the last fresh batch of the buns to the table next to me, whom ordered after. Also, I didn't know these took 1 hour to be made so she should have let me know in advance. Don't tell me it will take 10-20minutes when it supposed to take 1 hour. In the end I waited 2 HOURS for the CSB....  Although these were delicious, it was $8 for only 2 buns... If they were cheaper, I would have definitely come back just for these.

-grandpa's fun guo $9: Really good, the fillings were seasoned nicely with a hint of earthiness from the truffles. 

-octopus $16: octopus pieces were grilled to perfection and wonderfully soft. The asian take on the chimichurri sauce was really good as well! It was refreshing and tangy with a hint of citrus, which brighten up the dish. By the way, I swear baked chicken skin is the new "bacon", you can just eat it on its own as a snack. While the octopus has little flavour, paired with the salty chicken skin and the chimichurri, it was just plain amazing. I normally don't like eggplant and for some reason I enjoyed it with this dish! The texture was almost like a mash, provided a hint of bitterness with all the components of the dish.

-beef tongue $16:I didn't enjoy this dish. For me the oysters and beef tongue didn't go well together and this dish lacked flavors. Albeit it is a bit spicy and the pickles were amazing, but the beef tongue were too dry and there wasn't enough sauce to rescue it.

-ceviche $18: I really like ceviche, but this dish didn't have that bright and refreshing taste of a ceviche. There was too much vinegar and the sauce was too creamy to enjoy.

-salmon belly $18: The salmon was really tender and flavorful, with a slight crispy skin. The rice was undercooked and cold, not warm, just stone cold... But the sauce was a bit sweet and not too salty, almost like a teriyaki sauce?

-crispy smoked milk $8: didn't enjoy it. I understand since it is smoked milk, you will definitely taste...the smoke... if you know what I mean. The smoke "scent" or "taste" was really strong that it lingers in my mouth in an unpleasant way, which gave the pastry a very bitter taste. In my opinion, if the chef used apple or other type of woods, it would have been better. The smoke will be more light and delicate, which wouldn't have overpowered the dish. The malted ice-cream and lemon zest left a refreshing aftertaste and helped to balance that bitter taste of the smoked milk.
Edible, inexpensive, chinese-ish food.  If you enjoy chinese-ish food, you won't hate this place.  I didn't.  And...literally the best chinese food in all of Etna.  That said...of course...ONLY chinese food in Etna.  

Still...

Fast, cheap, open...it filled my belly and nothing came back up!  YAY!

Bland, blah, good option if you haven't eaten and you're walking in Etna and the other places are closed.
This is by far my favorite place to settle in and watch a game.  The catch is you have to be there early to get one of the comfortable seating areas.  If you can get one of the couches then settle in and enjoy.

The food is just ok.  This time I ordered the bbq pork nachos.  You get an ample portion.  I would recomend requesting the sour cream on the side.  Your nachos come with a mountain of sour cream that covers most of the surface.

Overall you definetely pay for the privilage, but for me it is well worth it.  Most sport books are geared toward the true pro's.  This place is geared toward actuall fans.
The chicken is juicy, crispy and delicious. I got the spicy one and it was a good balance of flavour and heat without burning your tastebuds off. From a value perspective it's a little pricey but it's something different and a higher quality bird than what you'd probably get at KFC.

The fries were outstanding. I don't even really like fries, but these were intensely crispy and super flavourful. 

My one major problem was the portion size of ketchup that game with the fries - I wish I took a picture, it was almost insulting. Like picture one of the little tiny packets of ketchup squeezed into a dip cup. The tiny dip cup was barely 1\/4 full of ketchup. I burned through it in about 3 fries. They need to leave a bottle out on the tables for people to portion themselves. 

Also, they should include a drink with the combo.

Overall, decent chicken and fries experience marred ever-so-slightly by a long wait time, lack of ketchup and higher prices than I expected.
Calamari is amazing!!!! It comes with a tangy sweet and sour sauce that I couldn't get enough of :)
Payback pest control is an extremely wonderful company. Family owned and very professional. I found them on living social\/groupon and was the best find ever. Andrew and his team have impressed and exceeded my highest of expectations. I have used them multiple times to treat and perform inspections on my own home. In addition I have also used them on my families homes as well, I will continue to use them in the future. I highly recommend them to anyone with pest control issues and concerns. Peace of mind achieved and guaranteed!
The Yelp five star description is "As good as it gets". And sure, it's not somewhere I'd tell visitors to the city to go, but as a banking experience, surely they don't come much better than this? Well, my negative point is this, and only this: it's closed on Saturdays. (I don't find the architecture remotely offensive, to briefly address the previous review for this branch). So, BoS, when you open on a Saturday, you will get a shiny fifth star.

And now the good! The multitude of good!

The size - it's large, and light, and spacious, and pleasantly laid out. The comfort - there are plenty of squishy seats for sitting in while waiting for your appointment. The service - the staff are super cheery and helpful, especially the lady I have talked to so many times at the enquiries desk (and whose name, to my shame, I cannot at this point remember, but I know she once lived for a while in Scarborough), and rarely have I encountered a queue in there; certainly never one that didn't move quickly.

Seriously, I go out of my way to use this branch instead of the one nearer to me, just because I like it so much. Which, I suppose, is pretty unusual for a bank branch, so maybe it really is as good as it gets! But I'm still holding out for that Saturday opening...
Summary: A bakery chain with world wide presence lacking world wide flair.  

What's good about it: It's cheap

What's bad about it: Boring food, nothing that's remotely interesting about the food

What food\/baked goods do they have?: A strange collection of indian pastries mixed with cupcakes, pound cakes chocolate chip cookies and hamburger buns? What? 

The only reason I tried this place at all was because of those dang Groupon\/WagJag\/TeamSave type sites that seem to be slowly draining my money, $5 at a time.   Hot breads is definitely a place I would walk into, then walk out of without ordering. There's just nothing appealing about the food there.  I'm a huge fan of Indian food, but the few Indian pastries they have on display don't look overly appealing, nor does their strange collection of cupcakes, chocolate chip cookies, coffee snacks, and pound cakes.  

Any there-in lies the crux of my problem with this place. Hot Breads comes off as boring establishment with no identity.  Their signs advertise stuffed Indian pastries for lunch, but they also serve a flank steak wrap, sugar cookies and cupcakes? Identify crisis?

Anyway, with my credit, I tried a chocolate chip cake ($4) which was not moist and had little flavor (when I brought it into the office, even my co-workers who usually jump over free food shunned it), pound cake ($4), chocolate chip cookies ($3 and not good at all), a few indian pastries ($1.50 each) and a flank steak wrap ($4.50).

Nothing here was worth mentioning, other than the fact that all the prices are fairly cheap.  Sorry Hot Breads, give me a call when you solve your identity crisis and learn to use a bit of that world wide experience to sell interesting foods.
Acai bowls hand crafted and fresh! Love how clean this place always is, and how consistent the bowls always are. They never skimp on fruit, and the taste is always yummy! Only bummer is the wait time can get a little frustrating.
Buffet that is really not so big, and not SO fat, but it's a great spot for lunch!

Cost: about $15 after taxes\/tip for lunch. I've never been for dinner.

It's Greek food, so it's relatively not so fat, but that's a good thing. At any rate, you'll eat enough that you'll become fat I suppose, because the food is pretty good. 

The food is generally all really good, the skewers (not marinated, but you can always add taziki and\/or hotsauce), fries (sweet potato fries as well, which are goooooood), calamari, and grilled veggies (I love grilled veggies) are all pretty good, made fresh in the open kitchen. 

Regarding the skewers and beef, honestly, some days are better than others. They cook them all in the open kitchen, some batches might be drier than others, but they're all freshly made.

Stuffed tomatoes, eggplant and a variety of stewed beefs round out the entrées, but I generally stick to the stuff I mentioned above.

For dessert, you have bhaklava, almond shortbread cookies, chocolate chip cookies, a variety of cakes (apple, coffee, chocolate, etc. etc.) and other carb heavy desserts, plus ice cream, all of which WILL make you fat. 

Here's a listing of their food if you're interested. While not Mandarin big, it's a decent size:

Dishes:  I'd say they have about... oh... 20 dishes.. chicken and pork skewers, some beef patty type things, spinach and cheese spanakopitas, french fries, sweet potato fries, calmari, roasted red peppers, roasted eggplant, roasted mushrooms, stuffed tomatoes, some saucy eggplant dishes, stewed beef, stewed chicken, some kind of lasagna looking eggplant dish, rice, steamed veggies, 2 soups, I'm sure I'm missing a few, but that's the majority of it.

Salad bar: fruits, salads (potato, seafood, garden, Greek (obviously), and spreads

Desserts: mentioned above
Any place that can convince me to try tomatoes in any form wins a prize. And so far, The Roosevelt is only one of like 2 maybe? Three at most. I recently went back when out downtown with a friend recently and after realizing we hadn't eaten yet, decided to try out their menu. So, not only is the beer pretty grand, and the atmosphere lovely (well, only when it's not crowded - I like to go on weeknights), but the grilled cheese and tomato soup is amazing. Yes. You heard it here folks. I'm praising tomatoes for the first time in my life. 

When it's not crowded, The Roosevelt is one of my favorite spots. It's like being at a house party before it starts, but not knowing the people. And the house is on a college campus so it's not perfect and not decorated perfect. It has the elements "the ladies like." And let me tell you, if you ever found a need to have 30 people in the bathroom at one time, The Roosevelt fits that requirement too.
Decent Car Wash great deal but everytime I go The kid is busy with different customer or no where to be found. Ive been interested in getting the fast pass but it's difficult if the only option is if the kid is standing by the payment machine.
I've been to their Henderson location, for which I kind of like the layout better, but the pizza is just as good here.  A friend and I came here for a later dinner, and all the workers were friendly, and the pizza was delicious.  Thanks again, Metro Pizza!
nice and light tasting cakes! Tried an original and matcha green tea slices.

similar to Lady M cakes! 

Will be back to check on the ice cream!
We were moving this week and when you can get a great deal like four for four, everyone's happy. And sometimes, after eating healthy and clean for a while, you just want something salty and greasy. My meal was a bacon double burger meal and let me tell you, it hit the spot. I don't recommend eating like this daily though.
I went out to Outback for a light snack. I was seated promptly without any delays. My server was very attentive and helpful with the menu. I ordered the side salad along with the soup for the day. The salad was fresh and crisp and I promise they have the best garlic croutons. The soup was better than I expected it was a creamy onion and cheese soup. And of course they brought out their famous bread and butter!
This place has almost no lineup compared to its neighbour Santosei. Not because apples to oranges comparison, but probably because this place isn't all that good (and all the craze is ramen). 

The main deterrent to the cutlets is the sauce. Its so weirdly sour. The combination with the fully cooked egg is a no no. The cutlet itself was meh, not too tender. 

Some good things about this place is the vibrant yellow paint. Made it stand out from the rest of the place in Little Japan, Dundas. Also the fast service.
Great banh mi sandwich with egg and pork loaf. My half-vietnamese wife said the bun bo hue was the best she had in Vegas - spicy and has chicken skin, funky meat parts that she loves but Americans might not go for. The broken rice dish was not up to par (except for the egg meatloaf which was the best I've had in Vegas) so I would skip that but the rest of the items are tasty. Lots of Vietnamese people eating here so you know they are keeping it real.
May I have a Venti, no wait make that a Trenti! 

This Starbucks is a bonus. It's located inside the Target on Blue Diamond.  The staff always busting swift movements behind the counter and having your order out as quickly as possible as well as piping hot or iced shaken or stirred!   The other day when I was there (please make notice of my pictures).  The Zombie Frappuccino picture and those two samples.  Those samples were created by the staff at this location AND listen those samples were YUMMY!  Vanilla bean with pink powder.  Oh my the taste! 
The Starbucks area is alway in tip top shape- clean & all is well stocked!  
The question which remains unanswered is this: do I make this a stop for Target or a stop for Starbucks... hmmm ;)
This place is well organized, clean, and of course stocked with all kinds of alcoholic beverages, sodas, cigars, glassware and snacks.

BUT it is a chain and I would much rather visit a locally owned establishment.  While I applaud the fact that they may be exposing more people to beer other than Budweiser and Coors, all of this 'fancy' beer and liquor is available at Tops Liquor in Tempe as well as Sun Devil Liquors in Mesa (and many other places I am sure). Actually, Tops and Sun Devil  have an even bigger selection and the beer is available at a much better price.  But this is about Beverages and More!   Bevmo is bright and shiny and appeals to the suburban woman who might be afraid to brush up against an unsightly hippy in the aisles of Tops.

I did give it 3 stars because there are good deals to be found on liquor, they have a great selection of glassware, they have a tasting bar and they are a one stop party shop for all of your drinks, snacks, stogies and barware.  Also, everyone that worked there was very friendly and helpful.  Heck, I would give any place that sells stinky cheeses at least one star!

There is another bevmo! scheduled to open in the Tempe Marketplace this summer.
I have walked past this place many times and have always seen other people eating here. It also smelled delicious. My partner and I finally gave it a try a few nights ago.

The evening we went to Malee's we found them to be quite busy. I had a brief wait but was seated fairly quickly despite it being a fairly packed house. Definitely give them a point for that one. 

The dining experience is where this story takes a downturn; but first, I have to say that our waitress was very courteous and professional. I have nothing but good remarks to say about her. Unfortunately, this is the last positive thing to be said in this review.

We ordered a stir-fry and a rice dish.

The stir-fry came out as an oily soup. Literally the food was drowning. It was incredibly unappetizing.

As for the rice dish, it was the unfortunate victim of extreme overcooking. There was literal lumps of mushed rice in the dish. 

What was served to us was pretty sad honestly. I'm not sure if it was an off-night for Malee's, or if our experience was consistent with how they normally operate. However, what I am sure about is that the experience was so poor that I am just not going to bother giving Malee's second try. The whole experience is laughable for the prices they ask.
Very very good chain family restaurant. I had their yellowfin tuna steak shanghai style and it was great. Service was excellent and the party of 5 I was with swore they could eat there every week as the menu was extremely diverse. It's hard for me to give a chain 5\/5 but this is pretty close.
Had a craving for some Chinese this evening so I took to yelp to find out what's good and available for delivery (lazy and proud).  I ordered the vegetable lo mein, sweet & sour chicken, and spring rolls (there's a minimum delivery price of $15, so I had to order more than I would have.. guess it's left over Chinese for the next day or two!).  The time quoted was an hour, and they were here in a little less than that.  The portions are huge, and the prices are really reasonable, which is awesome! Everything was great, plus their delivery area is only in monroeville, but they were willing to deliver my food to me in Plum, which was really appreciated!
I love everything seafood so this restaurant is one of my favorite. I've been a regular here ever since I ordered their salmon. Location - I like how it's away from the busy area of the strip - always a plus. 

For the love of all things good and holy, try the Wood-Grilled Atlantic Salmon with just the lemon butter sauce! It's just so simple but it's always spot on. In this case, less is more. I've had their spring special with the salmon dynamite style, I did not like it as much. I think the flavor was overwhelming that it overpowered the fish. 

The service here is consistently excellent and the food is always fresh. 

I highly recommend this place.
The golf carts are disgusting. Ours had dried soda on the top of the ceiling of the cart. Also, the starter in the shop said the pins were position #1 but there was nothing in our cart that told us where pin position #1 was. It was our joke of the day. The restrooms needs attention too. Whenever I play at kokopelli, I never finish less than 5:30min because the course management is trained to let a group go out every 5-8 minutes instead of 10-15 min. It's not enjoyable when you get stuck behind a group every hole. I even called last year to speak to the director of golf and left a message. The guy never called me back. The course conditions are always sub par. Fairways always have patches of dirt and mud and the bunkers and always flooded with water and don't have enough sand. The greens this most recent time we're excellent though. Tee boxes were ok. The nicest person was the cart girl. I'll be posting this review on yelp and golf now. For the course conditions and amenities, the money we paid wasn't worth it.
Very good .. had the mojo shredded pork with Cuban rice and beans and tostones .. empanadas as apps .. everything was very good!!
I had a craving for Mexican and came here (ie. Yelp) to figure out what we could do, because there is a very real lack of good Mexican food in Toronto. This place had some good reviews and wasn't too far away from us, so off we went.

Parking in Leaside can be pretty brutal, but we finally found a space and luckily, street parking is free. 

The restaurant is tacky, stereotypical, but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated. 

The menu has basic Mexican fare, burritos, fajitas, tacos, with your choice of meat. Nothing too outside of the box, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. 

We ordered the guacamole to start and I ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga. 

The guacamole is very delicious and creamy, but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough. We were really loading up the chips with the guacamole! 

The food came out and the was served with rice, a salad (sort of Italian dressing with feta and tomatoes) and refried beans. The salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland, but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice (I'm a wimp). 

The appetizer and our main courses came to $30 and we were VERY full. 

Service was good and food was good and it wasn't too expensive. It wasn't perfect, but we'll totally be back!
After having a baby a few months ago and moving to the midwest where places like this don't exist, I knew I needed to try Drybar out on a recent trip back to Scottsdale.  And at $35 plus tip - it's affordable!  

My hair is in the growing out stage, just past shoulder length, so I was worried that none of the styles would look as good as they do in the photos.  I was wrong - my "Cosmopolitan" turned out super cute with just the right amount of curl.  I looked done up without looking over done - just what I was going for!  I also saw they have "Floaters", which is a 10 minute head massage for $10...which might be a nice addition once in awhile.  

The salon has a modern and clean look, which I love, and staff were friendly.   If I still lived in Scottsdale, I could see myself having a girl's night start here for sure!  Plus, there is plenty of shopping and dining (lululemon and True Food Kitchen!!) nearby.
How many items can you name from the Shake Shack menu?  LISTEN, I'm sure I can name more...
As a born & bred NYer I'm always drawn into a Shake Shack- curiosity of the frozen creations just for each particular location!  I need that special concrete, you know;)  
I will admit I'm one of those of the cult-like followers of Shake Shack. 
No robots or iPads taking your orders here!  Well, not yet at least. 
Pleasant staff, clean facility at T-Mobile.  
All natural burgers, but no burger this evening.  Just concrete please! ;)  
Literally something for everyone.  I mean, it is that favorite 'street food'.  I usually Opt for the 'shroom burger, or burger with ketchup.  
NO! No mustard. 
Immediately received my concrete and off in pounding the non-concrete floors of t-mobile arena back into our seats for Depeche Mode.
This Hyatt Place follows along the new updated designs and concept of this newer brand of the Hyatt Family. 

The appeal is to savvy, younger business travelers, to give Hyatt something to compete in business categories against Hilton's, Holiday Inn and Starwood brands. The design is modern, with service minimized to the essentials for well seasoned business travellers, like a small bar, breakfast area, 2 room split suite with euro-type decor with male color tones, self check-in kiosks, and 42 inch Plasma TV with HD programs.

This one is a good value, as it is located in OldTown Scottsdale, just a couple of blocks from a large choice of trendy bars and restaurants, and not far from the Scottsdale Art district. 

Most of the Hyatt Places are located east of the Missisippi, and only 3 or 4 in California so far. Starwood has responded with a newer, similar concept, called their "aLoft" brand, with the same trendy hip loft like concept. 

I got a rate of $134, which isn't bad for the beginning of SnowBird season, when rates creap higher in the Valley, especially in Scottsdale.
Regal Cinemas is located in The Red Rock Hotel & Casino. It is next to the food court and near the bowling alley. The best spot to park is in the West Garage.

The theater is well maintained and always seems to be clean. There are always plenty of movies to choose from. I think they have about 16 theaters. They have IMAX movies and they have rooms in the theaters if you want to have birthday parties for the kids. The theaters always seem to be kept up very well and the staff is very friendly.

The only complaint I have is that sometimes they tell you that you can't bring your beverages from the food court in to the movie theater. It is purchased at the Red Rock, so what is the big deal?
I am a geek. I don't know why, but I really like establishments with the word monkey in the name. Tickles me pink at an adolescent level, like nut shots and fireworks. So Uncle Monkey's Bar started off at an advantage. 

It's definitely a dive bar, so don't go in there expecting something fancy schmansy. It's got monkey in the bar name, people. That should pretty much tell you everything you need to know about what awaits you inside.

Cash only, cheap alcohol (11 bucks for three shots of Jameson, and one fifty well!), stiff drinks, pool tables, and a decent jukebox. Pretty much all you need to satisfy this little barfly. Admittedly, I was a little drunk on crappy bowling beer by the time we got here, but I had an absolute blast. There might also have been darts, but when I'm seeing double bull's-eyes it's unlikely I'm going to be getting many double bull's-eyes, so the option entered and left my brain pretty quick.

The stand out decorations were a painting of a tarted up cartooney monkey in the women's bathroom and two creepy mannequins, a flannel clad lumberjack and a tomahawk carrying "chief." Granted, it's probably not politically correct, but it's definitely perplexing and helps drive home the fact that Uncle Monkey's doesn't give a flying fuck about catering to anyone that doesn't fit the dive bar mold. It's dark, weathered, kinda dingy and it exists for the express purpose of getting' you loaded, and the patrons reflect this fact by looking a little frayed around the edges as well.

The one issue I had with the place is the fact that it's hidden away in the corner of a non-descript strip mall with no sign on the front, so if you don't know about this place, you're unlikely to be finding yourself sharing a drink with the yokels.
The pork chop was juicy, tasty, and cooked to perfection. Mac and cheese side was not overwhelming, but had just the right combination of spices, which made it excellent as well. And the sticky toffee pudding for dessert was an unexpected and amazing surprise. Absolutely delicious. Service was extremely nice and competent. Cocktails were varied and did not try excessively hard. A great place overall.
Yummy authentic food.     Shy but very kind staff that truly were happy to show off their cooking
I try not to write too much about chains, but we came here for happy hour, we we went too familiar with their menu and we kinda screwed up our order and got way too much food, It was kind of a breakdown between customer and server, but we had to bite the bullet on some of it and still pay for more than we ordered, but they also helped out by knocking off a couple bucks and then giving us free apps the next time were in.
If you have a baby or a toddler, this is the place to be.  As soon as the Museum opened, I got my family membership.  There were times when my son and I spend everyday (from ages 10months -3 years old) there before he started preschool and my son never got tired or bored with the place.  At times, he was able to spend HOURS in the same area and for moms out there, you know what a blessing that can be!
The one most common complaint I've heard about the museum is the cost of entrance and cost of membership- most people think that it's a little on the pricey side.  I disagree.  Since I was there so much, I saw how much wear and tear the interactive activities goes through and how diligently the museum staff has been about replacing the parts so that each activity is always in perfect working order.  I also saw how quickly they replaced an activity if what they envision did not bear out in reality once the kids started playing with the activity.  And the place is HUGE!  3 floors filled with fun, creativity, and absolute joy.  The staff there is absolutely darling- so much patience for the little ones.  As often as I've been there, I've never seen a staff cross or annoyed with a child.
FYI for those who think this museum is expensive- the Children's Museum in NYC cost  $10 per person and the place is less than 1\/3 the size of ours.  PLUS their activities are not as creative or engaging.  Our Children's Museum in comparison is HEAVENLY!!
I absolutely LOVE this place!
A group of my friends and I were looking for a place to grab a drink while we were waiting for a table at a nearby restaurant. We saw Hair of the Dog and were a little skeptical at first glance of the exterior, but we were happy with our choice once we went inside. 

From the outside, Hair of the Dog looks a bit dark and run down, but the interior has a cozy and intimate feel and is slightly reminiscent of an English pub. We arrived around 6:15 and the lower level was about half full (there is also an upper level which I did not visit). We were seated by a waitress and greeted promptly by our server. They have an extensive beer and wine \/ cocktail menu. We did not look at their food menu as we were only having drinks, but the food that I saw passing our table all look really good, and I would be happy to return to try some of their dishes.

Our server was very pleasant and more than happy to provide drink recommendations and split our bills for us. I also enjoyed the slogan on the back of the servers' shirts: "Come, sit, stay" - a nice little play on words on dog commands.

This was a good find and a place I would return to for a drink or to try some of their dishes.
We went here for dinner on a Wednesday night. The place was empty aside from us and one other couple. Also, this place does not offer all you can eat sushi. This was a plus for me since I always think that the quality of the food is better in most cases. 

Spicy Bacon Tempura: This is one unique dish. I had bacon rolls before but not bacon tempura. What can I say? I love bacon and its flavor. I just did not like the oiliness of the dish. The bacon was fatty (I am not complaining!) and so frying it and putting batter around it made it a little too oily in my opinion. However, the sweet sauce that came with it balanced it out. I love anything sweet and salty.

Salmon Poke Tacos: The fish was fresh and the flavors were spot on. The fusion of the crunchy taco mixed with the mild Asian zing of the fish blend so well together. 

Salmon Rolls\/Spicy Spider Rolls: The rolls that we tried all had wonderful flavors in it. The spider roll was just a regular spider roll. They were more than accommodating when I requested for it to be spicy. The rolls were fresh and the flavors were one of the best I've had. 

Grilled Salmon Bowl: One of my favorites yet! I love salmon and if you can cook salmon perfectly, I'm always sold on your establishment. The flavors were simple and yet extremely satisfying. The salmon was served with white rice and a side of sautéed mushroom and vegetables. It was cooked in a sweet sauce that blends well with the saltiness of the fish. One of the best salmon I had! I just inhaled that thing like crazy. The portion was a good amount. But because it was so good, it kept me wanting more.

What a wonderful find! This place is located near Skinnyfats on Durango. I've passed by this place so many times without realizing it. I highly recommend that you check out this place.
There's been a proliferation of korean bbq joints in town but we keep going back to the old school places like Tofu Hut. Been going here for 5+ years. At times the service is a bit wanting but overall they have a decent KBBQ at a good price. It's no frills and no try-to-be- cool Top 40 crummy music blasting incessantly. The salad is tasty. Some of the other places have better cuts of meat but you will pay for it.
Groan, moan, sigh. We came here on a Sat night and the restaurant was okay busy but extremely under staffed. 
We were seated asked by one waitress what we wanted to order. When we said we needed more time to look at the menu, she promptly disappeared. I mean, literally. We never say her back in the dining room again. 
There was one sushi chef and one waitress for the whole place. Tick tock, tick tock. It took over 30 mins to order and prob even longer to get our food. 
The worst part was the waitress was pretty rude to us until she saw me check in on Yelp. Instantaneously she was much friendlier and nicer to us.  Pretty suspect!
We still left her a decent tip cause anyone can have an off night . . . But not sure we will be back- the food?  Who can remember- we dozed off while waiting for it!
Dropped by here for a quick lunch with a friend and was delighted by their choice of salads. I got a small container of salad for under 5 dollars that would be the perfect light lunch. Strong votes for their apple coleslaw which they top with dried cranberries and a wedge of crispy pita bread. 

My friend tried their veggie wrap and said it was great but she agreed that the true winner was the apple coleslaw. 

Friendly service, easy set  up and a delicious lunch! Can't wait to go back!
I had a great lunch with my mom and gram. The veggie burger was wonderful! We all loved our food!
Katie was a super helpful waitress,
We enjoyed her!
Really, I would give this place 3.5 stars because there were things about our experience that were 5 stars and then things that we about a 2-3 star. Location for me is great, literally a 2 min drive from my house. We walked in and I kid you not, there were 16 TV's plastered all over this place...a sports lovers heaven! Problem is they only had on 1 game. Service was very friendly and attentive, for me 5 stars. The wait time for food was a bit much (25 minutes for burgers) and the burgers for me weren't that good. I ordered my Avocado Burger to be Medium and it came out very well done. It was dry and I didn't end up eating it all. However, the macaroni and cheese was a slam dunk..5 stars! My boyfriend and I couldn't get enough of it! The burgers came with their branding "HOB" on top, which I thought was a cool touch. Beers were also ice cold and had a variety to choose from...another sports lovers dream! I would return but not order a burger.
Juice Bar is a great spot to pop in and pick up a healthy pick me up. My favorites are the Ginger Greens and Coffee Janet Smoothie. The service is friendly and I've never had to wait long to order or get my juice. So, why three stars? Inconsistency. It seems that the smoothies taste different depending on who makes them. I'd love to see more consistency in what I'm getting. Especially when I'm paying over $7.00 for a smoothie.
We (wife and I) come here a few times a year.  We typically enjoy the food and are shell-shocked by the drink prices.  

The good:
+The menu is ginormous.  There's something for everyone.  We almost always get the spicy ahi tempura roll.  Love it.
+The food is good.  It's not great, but it's good.  
+The atmosphere.  It's nicely decorated...fancy feeling.

The bad:
-It's very popular.  LOTS of people here at all hours.  It is not surprising to have wait times 1-2 hours on any day of the week at any hour of the evening.
-The drinks cost a small fortune.  My wife and I waited two hours for a table one night and thought..."why don't we just have a couple drinks while we wait?"  We did.  We paid our bar tab and then bought dinner and wine.  When we paid for the meal it cost less than the bar bill had for two drinks each.

Best way to enjoy the Cheesecake Factory is go an hour or so before you really want to eat and get on the waiting list.  Take a buzzer with you into the mall, shop for a while and then check back.  Otherwise, the wait is too long.  Plan ahead, and it's a nice evening meal.
I am so thankful I found this place! As a BMW owner, my biggest fear was getting work done on my car. I dreaded the times I have to go to the "stealership". They overcharge for everything! Never again shall I be fooled by them! 

All thanks to Victor for being accommodating of my needs. I was super worried about my car but he reassured me that he will take care of it and that he'll make sure to get me out of there in no time. They do honest repairs for you and only charge for a reasonable amount. These guys really know their stuff. 

I highly recommend this place to all BMW owners.
I can't believe I've never stopped in here to have lunch before. This restaurant is family owned, laid back, and the owner personally serves you. 
But let's talk about the food. I ordered the chicken pita for $7.95 and when my friend told me the portion was generous- she was not kidding!  We shared the entree and there was still enough left over for me to take home for another meal!  
The chicken breast cubed were tender and full of flavor. Look at the photos- you will not be disappointed by the food served here. And the lunch specials come with a side salad and a drink. All for $7.95!  
I will definitely be back again. And again and again!  Hidden gem!!!
Overall, 3.5 compared to other ramen restaurants but for a food court it's a 4. Noodles were a bit like the packaged ramen but soup base was pretty good! We got the spicy cheese ramen and both were pleasantly surprised. We would go back!
We just stopped in for a beer and we tried the oxtail empanadas. The empanadas were okay. Nothing to get excited about. I will have to come back another time and try some more menu items. For now the empanadas get three stars.
Best burger in Avondale by far! One of the best in AZ! If you like cheese burgers you must go. Good fries and onion rings too! Got 2 basic burgers with bacon, the bacon was crisp and they don't skimp on the lettuce onions n pickles, toasted bun is really good too. The ground chuck is fire, we will be back alot.
I booked this hotel on Expedia at a great rate for one night while passing through. I was actually pretty impressed with it! Carowinds amusement park is right across the street. The hotel was clean and well kept. It didn't feel run down like the last 2.5 star I stayed at. Check in went smoothly. The people at the desk were very friendly. I stayed on the 3rd floor. The room had two queen beds, a low dresser with flat screen tv, and a mini fridge & microwave. The bathroom is on the smaller side but had a decent amount of counter space. The free wi-fi was easy to connect to and speeds were good. My only complaint about the room... the wall mounted heating\/cooling unit was pretty loud.

The continental breakfast (6:30-9:30 am) was one of the better ones I have seen. They had cold cereals, instant oatmeal & grits, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, eggs, sausage, a good selection of breads & pastries, fresh fruit, a waffle making station, and, of course, juice & coffee.

Added bonus: There is a Wendy's across the parking lot in case the late night craving for a Frosty strikes... Yes, the thought crossed my mind!
This place changed owners a couple of times since my last review and even though it's okay for take out now & then it isn't as good as it was originally. Tiger roll and bonsai roll are still staples. Always friendly service.
Not too shabby for my second visit. Service took a long time. Not sure if that was due to it being a Friday night or not. Chicken Kabobs were tender. Salad and rice were good. Pita was also not bad. Decor didn't match the updates of downtown. Kinda fun not amazing.
I will commute to this mall, it's that good. Quieter than the local popular malls near me - Fairview, Markville, Promenade, Yorkdale (shoot me), etc but has all the higher end stores we ladies love. Easy to drive to and parking is a breeze. There are some great places to eat here and it's simply a beautiful, low key mall with well dressed mall enthusiasts:)
Yokohama is an amazing AYCE! I think it depends on what day and the time of day you go because everytime I go, usually a Saturday night, its delicious! The sushi is fresh and its order by ipad! The staff are okay, not the most outgoing but it's tolerable! I guess its hard for them to really make a conversation with you when you order through ipad, all they do is serve you the food, approve the order and then they get on their way! It's a good eat if you're down for lots and lots of good sushi! Definitely better than matsudas for sure!
Fast and convenient. I had a car key made with inside grooves. This place did a great job and were fairly reasonable.
We love this place we got married here, and have most of out family celebrations here. The rooms are lovely, we really like the two bed suite. It's gorgeous!! The balcony wraps around the entire suite!
Unfortunately, I recently had to return a purchase that I made at Brilliance New York in Vegas. My husband found out how much I spent and needless to say he was not pleased. 

The products literally worked like magic!  I saw instant results with the pore treatment as well as the eye serum. 

The customer service was excellent. Anabel at corporate was delightful to work with. Even thought they state that they all sales are final, she was able to issue a refund for me in a few days. 

The products are amazing and so is the customer service! I can't wait to place a new order once I have a bit more money saved up :)
We had a great experience from start to finish.  Robert Reel came out and was super professional and helped to walk us through the design for your (2) French Doors and (1) single walk through.  He was so helpful with the customer design and helped us achieve what we were looking for and kept us in budget.  

The people in the office we spoke to at the office were always helpful in keeping us posted with our appointment and getting us scheduled.

The two installers that came to our house were great!  Showed up on time and got the job done quickly while making sure it was done properly.  

We could not be happier, the doors are AMAZING!!!  The cost is a little (we thought it would be so much more) above what you would pay for at the big brick and mortar stores, but SOOOOOO worth it to have doors that do no look like everyone else's and that flat precut look.

Thank you artistic!  You have all been amazing and we will def. be using us for the future jobs we have in mind at the house!
Cute concept and food was good but not spectacular. I got the 2 meat platter with pulled pork and sliced brisket with 2 sides - mexicorn and macaroni and cheese. The meat could have been more flavorful, juicy, and tender. The sides were ok but again not amazing. The macaroni and cheese came in a skillet but was a little runny, and the mexicorn wasn't super flavorful. Overall, I'm not sure I need to return but it's a cool place to checkout with the attached bakery and car wash.
This is one of the most interesting watering holes that I have ever been to. It is an extremely unique vibe to it with a nifty Koi tank and a nifty asian-sensation bar. This place isn't in the best location in my opinion and you really have to know where it is to attend a night out here. Personally I wish it was more in an obvious place because it really deserves more recognition than it is getting. This gives Fitchburg another cool place to go and relax aside from the Great Dane. 

They have a great outdoor patio that is almost as big as their indoor seating and this is probably the one and only problem that I have with Atmoic Koi. That is the indoor seating, for some reason, in my personal opinion, it seems a bit cramped with not a ton of seating, when you are their on a busy night (friday or saturday) it seems impossible to find a seat. 

Other than that, the atmosphere is spectacular, one of my favorite features is the large wall sculpture of a Koi fish. It isn't true rock but it is made out of concrete I learned from one of the bar tenders which seems to have taken quite a bit of time! This gives such a classy feeling to this spectacular place. They also have a few TV's sometimes that have a cool movie on or some sports games etc... A shuffle board and some darts complete this hidden Fitchburg Gem for one of the greats in the Madison area alone. MORE PEOPLE NEED TO GET IN HERE SO HEAD THERE AND GIVE IT A SHOT! its a blast haha

All together this is definitely a great place to enjoy with a few friends for a quiet night out and some great and reasonably priced drinks.
This place is great! Best grits ever! The biscuits are awesome as well. I've ordered the fried green tomatoes & didn't love that dish. I've also had the French toast & it wasn't anything special. That being said, the turkey pot pie is amazing & I just love the feel of the restaurant.
Modern Mexican style spot: Friday happy hour time...If you order tacos on the patio be prepared to be attacked by flies.

The weather is perfect so we decide to be seated outside.  We start with a margarita pitcher and guacamole which the highlight of it all was the 2 table sauces.  Thank goodness for the spicy green & red sauces to dress everything up.

We get a tray of tacos: 2 fish, carne asada, veggie, shrimp, and pork.  It looks great once it arrives but 7 FLIES start aggressively bombarding us.  Thankfully the busboys must know about this and we put our tacos on our plate and they whisk the wooden & metal tray.  I cannot stand eating something a fly has landed on so I was waving my hand over my 3 tacos and shoveled them in as fast as possible.  As for the taste- the tortilla is homemade but very thick.  The carne asada was my favorite- love the marinaded flavor.  My veggie taco was lacking punch.  Fish tacos were very yummy.  My companion has the pork and shrimp which he seemed to enjoy.

We ended with the lime tart at the recommendation of our sweet & server.  It was absolutely delicious with a nice serving of real whipped cream.  No flies at this time!
Not the newest or nicest Smiths around. But they have some of the best line management. There is always someone up there directing customers and calling people up to the registers. But it looks like its going to close in June 2015 because they don't plan on renewing there lease.
This used to be my salon of choice until I began spending more time in Chandler and decided it was time to go elsewhere.  My best friend gets her cut and color done there now, and loves it - see Janelle!  I used to just get a haircut, but always had an enjoyable experience...and recommend it to friend's new to town and looking for a hair stylist.  

To be honest, one of my favorite things about getting my hair done there was people watching and checking out what all the stylists are wearing.....they are always trendy and cute.   Prices are average - $60 for a hair cut.
We came here after other provider turned us down. The service was super quick, staffs went above and beyond to serve us, even got our windshield fixed. Thank you guys, well earned 5 stars.
Awesome happy hour, very well crafted drinks, love the old fashion and Juan is my favorite bar tender!! pork belly sliders are delish as are the shishito peppers. :) great atmosphere.
I love this location! It's so close to my house, AND it's in the same shopping center as Target, Nordstrom's Rack, Ulta & Marshalls.  The staff is great and they have a wonderful selection.
This is my go to for tacos and burritos in the area. They change their menu on a monthly basis but I think the tacos and burritos are always on it.
Still in love with this place and how much care they really have for all of their clients. 

I hit another, I want a piercing moods and swung in on a lunch break last week, determined to get this piercing I thought would be perfect on me. 

As usual Jo was absolutely amazing. He brought me back and we discussed what I wanted and when he looked at how my ear was shaped he said that I may want to try something like this (then drawing dots where they would go). He took into consideration my piercing past and said it's subtleness and the petite jewelry would suit me well.

And as always, I came out super impressed and ready to show off my piercings. They still look amazing a week later. I'm still in love, and they are perfectly healthy. Job well done. But I'm not surprised.
Decent food cheap drinks and a great place to catch a sports game. The servers are friendly and this is located in a great spot with plenty of parking.
I've waited a while to write this review because I hate writing bad reviews..  but my love for my Himalayan cat, Bean, has propelled me to do so.

If you care about your pet, please DON'T use Scottsdale Veterinary Clinic.  I am new to Arizona from Michigan and on my own, I found this place on the Web and decided to go with it.  My cat is all I have, and I care about him very much, and I am very angry with the lack of care this Clinic has for animals.

I took Bean into the clinic late January of this year to get a grooming.  My bill was over $300 for a haircut with sedation.  They offered me no "new client" special or anything.  They even quoted me a rate over the phone that was completely different than what they charged me.  I understand as a new client, certain vaccinations were required.  But telling me a checkup would be free and then charging me for it is NOT OK.  Moving on..

Now, his lion cut, which was essential for matting prevention (typical on a Himalayan), isn't a hard cut AT ALL to do, but was UNEVEN, and whoever did the grooming totally lacked attention to detail.  If I am going to pay that much for a grooming, at LEAST pay attention to my instruction (I had even wrote down how I wanted the cut), and he had chunks missing.  Clipper ridges, and spots that were completely neglected.  No, my cat was not pretty.  I literally had to go home with the scissors and FIX his haircut myself.  
If a cat is SEDATED, you can take your time.  THAT IS WHY I TOOK THE DAY OFF WORK.  That is why this clinic told me they would need all day with him!

Worst of all....  I took the entire day off work (this translates to losing a day of pay) so I could be available to pick him up when they were done with him, which they said "sometime in the late afternoon early evening".  So I waited around Scottsdale\/Tempe area.  I live all the way in Desert Ridge.  But they didn't even CALL me to tell me he was finished, as promised!  

I dropped him off at 9am, and the day rolled by and it was going on 5:30pm..  finally I called THEM and they told me, apathetically, "yeah, he's ready", as if they were annoyed I was calling (The receptionist - I should have got her name - all I remember was she was a little heavyset and blonde and around my age - but I was too furious, and she didn't even bother to notice, nor care when I said I wasn't happy with the service, she acted as if she didn't even hear me).  Every question I had for her she interrupted me.

I go to collect him, and out of ALL THE EMPTY CAGES AVAILABLE in the back..  (they didn't bring him out to me, they said he was hissing and needed ME to go get him), they put him in the one above an EXTREMELY HYPER Pit Bull.  I looked at all the other empty cages.  Are you kidding me?  I was furious.  OF COURSE he is going to be terrified, coming off sedation and right on top of a loud dog with its tail wagging and barking like crazy..  I don't care if it was due to how late I was showing up - that was completely the clinic's fault.  Who would do that to a cat coming off sedation anyway?  Complete ignorance.

I am spreading the word about this Clinic.  Everywhere I can.

Get some volunteers that have some animal knowledge, and also a desk clerk who actually looks customers in the eye instead of filing her nails.  Then she could see the tears welling up in my eye as I signed the credit card clip holding my shaking cat.  Not only was I robbed of my time, my money, my poor cat was traumatized beyond belief.  

These people are a NO GO.  Do not take your animal here.

[Now, Ashley, I have read your condescending remarks back to people who have a hard time with your Clinic.  I work in the airline industry you can guarantee I am spreading the word around about your clinic.  My job is LITERALLY to calm people who have anxiety flying in an airplane.  People of all ages from all over the world.  And your clinic can't even get it right with animals?  UNACCEPTABLE.
My company is responsible for a large percentage of new residents who are looking for vets, dentists, schools, etc.  YOU NAME IT - anything that comes with relocation.  I refuse to keep silent about the mistreatment I received any longer.  

Customer SERVICE and Customer CARE.  You're doing it wrong.  Your long list of people who have attested to your "good services" because you keep your lobby clean does NOT make up for the experience I had - again, it all boils down to ignorance.  
A company that CARES WHOLEHEARTEDLY about their customers - (especially those who have no voice - ANIMALS) - MAKE IT RIGHT.  It's just that simple.  
Learn how to really SERVE a customer - And your customers absolutely must be taken care of, they are typically worried and\/or hurting over their animal - THEIR FAMILY MEMBER - Once you get the heart right, you will go very far.  

Your success will lie in your heart, not your pocketbook.

Please note:  You do not ask for "a second opportunity to gain their trust back" when you lost it.  YOU MAKE IT RIGHT.]
I must have been here on an "off" night given the reviews.  Went with a friend for free wing night and left pretty underwhelmed.

The (very young) bartender let our beers go empty multiple times without asking for a refill.  Poor attitude in general from the bartender.  The wings were good enough but lacked sauce most of the time.  My friend went for a third order of wings at 7:45 and was told he would be charged for them.  Oddly enough, the bartenders friends who sat next to us wasn't charged.  I was relieved when the shift changed as I was hoping her replacement would be better but he was no better.  He looked like he just got off a three-day drug binge.  

I won't be back.
i love oyster boy i go at least once a month with my friends...it is so good all the time and we always have so much fun :)
mmm -lobster, fish tacos, the ceasar! and this incredible pasta i had the last time i was there ...and the oysters are always good  
it can end up being a tad expensive but its totally worth it
I go out of my way to do the Sunday brunch here every time I go to Vegas.  It used to be better, but it's still good.  I love the ambiance both inside the casino and the buffet.  I've always enjoyed the dealers here too.  I love the fact that there is character in the design of the building; that really seems to be missing on so many places on Fremont.
Superbe et grande épicerie. Une rangée complète de riz, au moins deux rangées de vermicelles, une rangée de thé, une rangée de champignons secs et en canne ou en sac..etc etc... Bref il y a de tout, même des produits arabes et latinos. J'ai trouvé du tahini, du couscous, du quinoa et une variété de tofu (avec saveur) pour beaucoup moins cher qu'à l'épicerie. Je vais y retourner pour la rangée complète de produits pour faire des sushis. Oh aussi, une variété de feuilles et légumes verts. Bref, belle découverte! 

Non je ne suis pas végétarienne, il y a aussi toute sorte de viande et de fruits de mer (congelé par exemple...), mais très abordable.

Vous pouvez aussi vous arrêter dans le petit resto et manger sur place. Il y a des grillades, des soupes tonki et des sandwichs viet genre à 3$.

Le plus important, c'est que c'est propre et bien placé...(pas comme certaines grandes épiceries asiatiques dont les produits sont avec pleins de poussières et avec une peur qu'une bibitte sorte des étagères. 

Belle découverte pour les gens de St-Léo, Mtl-Nord, St-Michel et ceux qui ne veulent pas se rendre jusqu'à Jarry(proche de Pie-Ix), Chinatown ou Metro Jean-Talon
A restaurant where everything is vegan\/vegetarian??  OMG yes.  So much yes.  I can't remember what I had, since my date ordered for me, but it was SO good.  I met Chef Kenny, as well, and he's a sweet guy.  The server was very attentive and friendly, and took good care of us.  I look forward to coming back here many times!!
Another favourite spot! This place has such friendly and welcoming staff. Best yet, we don't know too much about Persian baked goods so the lady gave us a sample. What awesome service to those of us who know nothing lol. To date we have tried the baklava, some cookies, danishes and nuts. I've been to a few Persian spots for some goodies and this is the best I've found in the area. The baklava is to die for - juicy and nutty with crispy\/flaky layers. Oh so good. 

Atmosphere here always seems quiet when I come here (evenings throughout weekdays and weeknights). I can see this place as a great place to study, meet up with some chatty friends, or just pick up some baked goods. Decor could definitely use an update but I also like this kind of family bakery non-fussy type of vibe. 

Highly recommend:)
There's just something cool about Hex Coffee. Perhaps it is the shared space with Good Bottle. The visually appealing logo. The simple name. The hipster ambiance. The music playlist. I can't quite put my finger on it but Tanner and crew knocked ti out of the park. I ordered the seasonal latte. Kabocha squash, cardamom, star anise, brown sugar, espresso + milk. It was a perfect compliment to the fall weather. I was excited to grab a pastry from Whisk & Wood but, sadly, the case only had one thing that didn't strike my fancy. 

I enjoyed my latte at the bar while scoping out the current drafts on at Good Bottle. The seating area is pretty limited and mostly communal\/shared but there was space to pop up with a laptop and get some work done. Parking was easy to find in the shared lot.
I do like Chick-Fil-A but noticed some quality differences with this location from the other locations I have visited. The drive thru line at lunch is ridiculous (prepare to wait at least 15 minutes) but decided to wait anyways just for pure convenience and part laziness. Service was pleasant as always, I do like when they address you as "Sir" or "Ma'm" and say "My Pleasure". Staff is very accommodating and helpful. However, when I got back to eat my lunch, I noticed the chicken sandwich I ordered was very overcooked and the lettuce was soggy and almost brown in color. The usual large piece of tomato was just two measly tomato slices plopped down. Honestly, I did eat it but was very surprised at what the quality was here...I've never had this issue before. I hope management reads this and can improve their product.
These guys are awesome it's hard to find great customer service in this town not to mention awesome work! Did a great job on my wife's classic Monte Carlo SS bodywork & buffed out the plastic headlight covers it looks like new again. I was so impressed I had them fix the bumper on my Xterra, remove & replace a window decal & remnants of an old one. Gave me an amazing deal. Thank you Mike I would highly recommend this place & we will be back!!!
Second visit here, and once again I am a happy customer. Deep tissue, trigger points and stretching, I felt sooooooo relaxed. Great pricing, great environment and a great massage, what else can I ask for. Thanks again Nicole.
Had lunch at Rock Lobster today for a colleague's birthday.

We had a group of 6 so we called yesterday to make a reservation but unfortunately they don't take reservations - all too common these days. Luckily we walked in at noon and had no problem getting a table. 

Service was attentive and helpful. 3 of my colleagues had the fish and chips (made with haddock) and they looked very good, served on a slate platter and accompanied by ketchup, tartar sauce (which I was told was very good) and a charred lemon half which I also thought was a nice touch. 2 other colleagues had the lobster poutine which was a smaller portion than I had expected from pictures and judging by the price. It smelled very good however and they enjoyed it. 

I had the lobster roll, which comes with a side of house cut chips, and I added a side of potato salad cause I'm a sucker for it. As with the lobster poutine I thought the meat could have been a bit chunkier. It wasn't a skimpy portion but it looks like it is when the meat is shredded as it was. I did appreciate the restraint on the mayo but I missed a bit of seasoning and perhaps some mild additions to the roll (some celery or something?). The chips and potato salad were excellent, the potato salad had nice crunch from pickle and celery in it and a tasty dill creamy dressing. 

Overall I would go back to try some other menu items, curious about the jerk shrimp roll and that fish and chips looked great. Also want to try that over priced over garnished caesar sometime.
If you go here sit in the bar, Roxanne and Linda are amazing. These two lady's have kept us coming back for several years now. 
The steak is great and cooked to the known standards now. Outback used to use their own versions of well, medium etc.
The food is somewhat pricey but it's a steakhouse so that is to be expected. The aussie cheese fries are best if you ask for layers cheese. 
Restraint is clean and we'll maintained.
I'm all for quaint family owned and operated places because there is a lot of potential and undiscovered delicious dishes. This is not one of those places. They need to apply to be on Restaurant Impossible because they need an overhaul. Their decor makes no sense whatsoever and the food was horrible. Their chips and salsa was great but it's pretty hard to mess that up. What's up La Mestiza?
Where do I start? The food is fantastic.ade to order. I got the small classic Philly Cheese steak "wit", onions. PERFECTION. The fries were perfect. The service: friendly, happy and a pleasure to be around. All in all, Hank's will be a place that the hubby and I will come to on a regular basis. My advice? TRY IT!'
Caveat: this trip was to see family no strip on the agenda, had this been a standard "party in Vegas" weekend probably would've never stayed here...

Solid 3 stars! Area is sh$tty but not NYC pre 1985 broadway sh$tty lol but bums and depressed people and closer to the under belly than the high roller side of Vegas...BUT

Room is clean, bathroom works fine, AC is tip-top, bed was a surprisngly comfortable king (sheet and thin blanket) TV, ipod\/radio, gamblin in the lobby & a bar (eh, you get what you pay for...) the cafe has decent bacon & eggs, pancakes and french toast good too (not great mind ya but good). 

Yeah for $18-$40 a night depending on the day NOT BAD AT ALL!

Not for the label whores or the thin skinned. 

Real folks, real value. I've been to Vegas atleast ten times and each time I ended up spending atleast $250-$500 on my lodging, Atleast (per night ahem!) Gold Spike for less than a $100 for a weekend getaway is worth it!

*crash pad, not hangover pimp a$$ suite
**Fremont St is cool and is a block away nice low key wild Vegas experience. Low Key in the sense that these clubs, bars, strip clubs etc want your business and they know they aren't on the strip and they also know that the area attracts the budget conscious and the types of people that higher end clubs make wait in line forever, sometimes never getting in...(but perhaps for good reason lol real rough looking bunch) yeah, so they keep it real and truly want you there. Clientele is less "polished" haha but certainly fun times with fun people!
***they have a cool little pool called Oasis at Gold Spike probably nice in the warm months
****not worth more than $60 a night I see higher rates I wouldn't pay $79 here
I finally decided to give Label another chance and I am very impressed. There's definitely more room to dance and the VIP section is awesome. The staff was friendly and helpful and the music selection was perfect if you haven't been to label recently you should definitely give it a second try!
One of the nicer spots in Markham including a cute little patio. On our recent visit I have to say the food has really improved. We recommend the foie gras, spicy octopus, fried chicken, meatballs, fries, meat and cheeseboard, and the truffle cauliflower (super cheesy goodness, so we ordered two). I had to remove a star because the service was a big miss. We had to keep waving down our server even though it was not busy at the restaurant.
Very nice Hotel. Reasonable prices close to the Cleveland Clinic (about a mile) we have stayed her 16 nights. Met all the front desk staff including the valet staff. Everyone was very nice and provided excellent service.
The quality of food at Brio is a pleasant surprise.  The lunch menu has a lot of variety and I probably would have been happy ordering one of 4 or 5 different things, but lasagna wins almost every time, and Brio's version is quite nice.  It comes with your choice of 3 different salads (chopped, Caesar, or house) and I was very happy with the chopped.  Far more than a boring plate of greens, and it isn't drowning in dressing.   The lasagna arrived not long after, and it's made with white sauce, meat, and the usual noodles\/cheese\/sauce.  I dove in and was a little sad when I took the last bite because for a second, I contemplated ordering another.  It's nicely balanced, has just a teeny tiny amount of burned edges of cheese\/noodle.and the meat is moist, like a meatloaf.

Mimosa wasn't anything to get too excited about, but the raspberry gelato (not on the dessert tray) was the perfect amount of dessert.  Allegedly Brio may make its way to California, and I can't wait!  So much better than Olive Garden!
We visited Woodlands at 8PM on a Saturday night. The restaurant was completely packed with local Indian families, which I take to be an excellent sign that the food is authentic.

Unfortunately, the wait staff seemed completely overwhelmed. It took 20 minutes for someone to even come by our table and take our orders, and another 20 minutes for our Samosas to come out of the kitchen. Once we had the Samosas, the rest of the food came out in a timely fashion, but waiting until 8:40 for our food was agonizing. I was sat with my back to the kitchen and I was so hungry that I kept looking over my shoulder, to the point that my husband said, "Trust me honey - once it looks like our food is coming I will stand up and *applaud* there is no reason to keep looking behind you."

Service and food slowness aside, our meals were excellent. I ordered the Chana Masala. My husband ordered Dal Makhani. I had reservations about visiting a vegetarian Indian restaurant, but the food was really very, very good. Woodland's won't ever be the first on my list to visit, because I prefer meat-based dishes, but if you've got a vegetarian friend who wants to eat somewhere, don't shy away from Woodlands because there's no meat on the menu.

The service wasn't terribly friendly, which is quite different from what I'm accustomed to with my favorite Indian restaurants (my favorite places are in DC, actually). But the food was terrific.

Woodlands was quite a haul from our Ballantyne home, but it was good to visit once to see what the fuss was all about. The food was fantastic, but with the distance, long waits to get our food and poor service, I doubt we will be back. If you're in the area and hankering for Indian food at a less busy time, I recommend visiting.
I was unprepared for this. UNPREPARED. Beautiful lasagne, colourful and flavoury salads (shut up, flavoury is totally a word) and a chap playing such soul drenchingly gorgeous jazz piano that I had to stop eating on three separate occasions because it took away my ability to do anything but sit and attempt to breathe.

The lasagne, being (naturally) vegetarian, was almost more like a moussaka, and so delicious that I wanted about eight of them. I suddenly understood why the chap I ordered from had repeated my order back to me as "one lasagne?" But any more, along with the two included salads, might have destroyed me, particularly as I planned to sample one of the exquisite looking cakes, for which I barely had room after those delicious lasagnery salady exploits. I reckon five star lasagne with a choice of two out of nine salads for just £7.50 is a damn good deal.

I then, as planned, proceeded to the cakery. The cakes aren't labelled, so I asked the girl what each cake was and she had fun matching the names on a list to what they looked like. I opted for the chocolate and lemon, topped with physalis, because it looked dinky compared to the others. Ha - WRONG! It was dinky in size only, but denser than a singularity and rich, rich, rich. A little dry by nature, it was served with a whole glass dish of lemon curd for my ladling pleasure. Ogh. I think I shall never move again, my friends.

Dark wood tables, a sofa at the far end, stone vault ceilings... It's a wrong wrong miracle that this place was relatively quiet when I appeared on a Tuesday afternoon, admittedly a little after the traditional lunchtime. I'm torn between wanting it to be as packed as it deserves to be and wanting to keep it as mine, my own, my precious, for all time. Because did I mention the free wifi? Oh, I didn't? Well I have now.

What twig? Oh, this twig. No, no, never you mind, no, this twig is, uh, just, er, well I am definitely not building a nest here, that's definitely not what I am doing, ahaha haha ha...
Southern Cross is the first place I think of for a quickish lunch with a friend before they have to catch the train. Just a little less than halfway down Cockburn Street, which winds colourfully toward the Market Street entrance to the station, it's ideally located and, inside, bigger than it looks.

I've been here a couple of times; on this most recent visit, I opted for the smoked salmon toast with cream cheese. It was really good, but - and I can't believe this is actually a criticism! - too much salmon. I are well over three quarters of it but by the time the toast and cheese were all gone, it began to be a little sickly just downing the salmon.

They have lots of cakes and things which (amazingly) I've not tried yet, but they look good. Be aware that they also will not split a bill for you. That seems totally weird to me; I understand it during the high visitor volumes of August since it can slow proceedings but on a regular day I don't see why they'd simply refuse...

Service is also variable. The first time I came, I had a delightfully charming young man who admired my brooch. This most recent time, the young lady was civil, but slightly curt. Nonetheless, the three of us got fed amply and had a drink each, and the bill came to £26, which really isn't bad in the Mile area.
Words cannot describe how amazing this show is. I have no idea how these performers can move like they do. The props, scenery and costumes are like candy to the eye. Each one out does the next. Of course the music is great - The Beatles - do I say more. This is by far the best Cirque du Soleil show.
My second visit and just as impressed! The service has been awesome and they have been more than willing to accomodate me and my food allergies\/restrictions even on a busy Friday night. So excited to be living right around the corner!
Very nice 'Western' bar and grill. The food was good and the happier was inexpensive.  Their portions are large as well.  If you are hungry and want to find a cool watering hole, try this place.  I will be back several more times for sure!
Even though I've already professed the fact that I don't mind waiting awhile in order to consume the delicious breakfast foods at Matt's, I certainly don't mind a little diversion from the usual stand around, chit chat, look at other customer's yummy food, wish I had some, get some water instead, sigh. 

The Downtown Phoenix Public Market is the perfect diversion from this routine! There are a wide variety of stands, especially considering it's such a small market, and there aren't that many tchotchke arts and craft offerings to be had. Just a couple candles and soap stands that are dominated by a lot of fresh and organic edibles. 

Some of the stands offer little samples of their wares, which of course I had to take advantage of. I had a sip of Hansen's orange creme soda, some iced tea, organic hummus with a pita chip and some interesting roasted Mexican seeds that the Aztecs used to cultivate. Those salty, crisp treats made a satisfying pop when I bit 'em, tasting nutty and delicious. Almost bought a bag. Thought better of it when I saw the guy selling baklava.

A small portion of baklava and kataifi was my only purchase, both of which were decadent sweet treats later on after lunch. The layered phyllo dough, the piles of nuts, the honey slathered on thick! It was divine. At 4 bucks for these two tiny squares, it wasn't the best bang for my buck, but the taste totally made up for the size, and when it's that orgasmicly good, size doesn't matter, go ahead and ask anyone. I was also tempted to pick up some pickled asparagus and some jalapeno jelly. Just for kicks.

There was a pretty good live folksy musical act when I was there too, so check out the entertainment if you happen to be in the area. And if you're stuck on a Saturday behind ten other groups vying for the butter soaked goodness of Matt's Big Breakfast, this little market is small enough that you can walk the entire extent of the lot, try all the samples they offer, and make it back to the corner of 1st and McKinley before your party is called.
Since I really needed my nails done and this place was in the mall, I went there. I had been before and it was an okay job, so I pretty much use this place as a convenience method. If I must, I must!

One girl did my toenails and did a nice job, although I loved the colour and the sticker at the bottom of it was missing, so I have no idea what colour I am wearing, should I want to use it again.

The woman doing my nails wasn't as good as the woman doing my toes though. First of all she kept making comments about how small my nails are. I'm an art teacher, so having long nails is really not to my benefit, but thanks for bringing this up constantly! She was also a bit rough. She blamed it on my fingers being tensed, but honestly, they were tense because it hurt! It started becoming a vicious circle!

I think that the amount of gel she put on was WAY too much. Some nails you can see the dip made in the gel. Also, I have only had them a week and I feel like they can be easily ripped off. Things keep getting caught in the edges.

The colour is nice and there was a good selection of colours to choose from, but as I stated before, if you really need something done, here is great, because it's HERE, not because of what a great job they do!
One for the adventure books!

So here we go... never in my life would I have thought that I'd be riding in one of these quads as a driver and not as a passenger in an ATV tour. Blame it on my hubby who loves the outdoor adventures and we found this deal in Groupon to add to our list of 'things to do' during a mini getaway in Vegas.

The adventure begins... we called the business to book a tour and the process was quite easy on the phone. We even had a reminder phone call on the evening prior to our scheduled date. We gathered at the Excalibur Hotel grounds where we were picked up by a complementary shuttle. The drive to the actual tour site was about an hour from the Las Vegas strip. 

When we got there we were briefed on safety and our itinerary, which included 28-miles of scenery. The tour was for approximately three hours and were divided in two groups - beginners (that's me and my hubby) and the more experienced guests. It was my first time EVER to grip throttles as we dashed through the beautiful red-rock scenery, nature trails and desert landscapes of the Valley of Fire State Park on our ATV's. The ride included unlimited water bottles and a deli lunch sandwich. For 3 hours we kicked up dusts, outpacing little creatures on our mini ATV's, careened over dusty hills while decked out in our riding gears (there was a 30-min break for lunch). What an adventure! Our three professional guides were very nice (and patient) to lead us beginners over the hills and skid through the ravines of the Valley Of Fire State Park. One led in front of the group while the other stayed in the very back, making sure no one was left behind, and one drove along in a jeep (just in case one of us, for any reason, had to ride back to base). TIP: (for women with long hair)... tie your hair or roll into a bun and tuck it in inside your helmet.

jR and I had a blast and at the end said he was proud of me for going along with him in this tour! I'm just glad I survived it as we were shuttled back to Excalibur Hotel. LoL! well... you only live once!  5-stars for professionalism and a fun vacation experience!

Review #0343
It's clean and busy, but the employees don't know how to smile or even fake that they are happy to be at work. 
Also the display screens at the pumps can be very hard to read in the afternoon because of the sun glare. The yes and no buttons are worn so you cannot read them
My boyfriend and I moved here from LA. We paid almost double what we do at ST and it's wayyyyy nicer. There are two volleyball courts, 24 hour gym, pool with grill and flat screen, hot tub, etc. The other tenants are super friendly and we are quite content. We have parking for both of our cars, plenty room for storage and the property is very well maintained. If there is ever an issue all we have to do is email a service request and BAM, taken care of. Also, they throw BBQ's, movie nights and other activities to brighten our day, increase a sense of community and boost morale. The property is directly off the Greenbelt and in walking distance to CVS, other food places and a local bar (which we find quite amusing).

Thank you San Tropez. We will be staying for a minute.
Recently decided to order delivery from this place through Just Eat. They usually offer a 20% discount on all orders, so we figured why not. The menu seemed promising, with a long list of specialties at very reasonable prices. Their seafood selection was pretty small, so don't expect to find yellowtail tuna, seabass or uni here. Some of the reviews mentioned a free roll for orders over $20, but we didn't get any, which is fine because the sushi didn't turn out to be great. The rolls lacked flavor and had very little fish. Just overall a very blah experience that I wouldn't recommend.
The food is divine. I wish I worked\/lived closer. The are super friendly and fast. The place is a cave, but you don;t notce once you take a bite.
Food was pretty good. I had a ground chicken burger with there battered onion rings which were great. My gf had the e&e burger... This burger was pretty darn tasty. The kitchen seemed kind of slow... But other than that I was pretty impressed with just about everything else.
Calling all Pac-10 college sports fans! 

Do you want the perfect place to stay in the Valley of the Sun while your team is playing against Sparky at ASU?

Try the Aloft. It's decor is like a hip, trendy, bachelors pad, and their lobby is like a bottle service club or lounge (without the bottle service).
It is brand new, just opening in February 2009. 

Here, when you get hungry, you can go across the street to Inn-n-Out Burger, and after that, go to YogurtLand for Fro-Yo, and what more could you want? Yes, there's a Starbucks within a 1 minute walk. 

Oh, it is only 1 mile from campus and the Stadium, and close to the Phoenix airport. 

Aloft is not your father's business hotel. It is designed for the younger, hipper, going-on-my-first-years-of-business-trips-crowd. 

The rooms are like a city studio dwelling in design; Euro efficiency in space, trendy decor and colors like that modern furniture store in that trendy city neighborhood you hang out in. 

But be careful, there is no real closet or dresser. Just cubby holes, a curtain to cover your clothes, but no real drawers to hide your drawers!

If you have friends visiting, hide your unmentionables in your suitcase. Oh, and the door opens right into the bathroom sink, so when you are nude, brushing your teeth after a shower after 8am, try the deadbolt and lock so the maid doesn't walk in on you butt naked! (Unless she is cute and you're an exhibitionist!) 

The gym is nice with all new machines, the pool area is like a fancy desert party pad, and the lobby common bar area is like a Vegas lounge, with the bar as the main feature, 4 small TV screens, and a pool table to shoot around on. 

Aloft is exactly like Elements, the other new hip, trendy chain from Starwood.. Aloft is the new younger demo chain for W Hotels, and Elements is almost exactly the same and is the younger., hipper chain for Westin. They are all owned by Starwood hotels, ergo the similarities. 

But don't expect food. They have snacks, like 7 Eleven or Egg McMuffins; and they offer a free hot drink for Gold and Platinum Starwood frequent guests. Big whoop! (They do have a self serve latte machine). They do offer free WI-Fi though, and free parking here. Neon lights on the sides of the building, too. No charge. Haagan Daz for late nite snacks, too. 

Pricing is reasonable, in the $100 - $150 range, depending on season, location and availability. Most Alofts are in the east. So far there is only one in California and 2 in Arizona.
I love this store! It's colorful, choclatey, and cute. Very family friendly. 

There are 4 floors neatly categorized with a variety of items. I've been here twice now in the last 4 years and within that time gap, I saw most of the same items from years ago. So their selection of items don't or rarely ever change. 
this can be good or bad. Good because you don't have to worry about low stock of items. Bad because well, there's not much to look forward to if the items are always the same if you visit more than once. 

I really recommend the 3D movie too. It's cute and free. It was like 15 minutes long I think?  There is staff that will call out when seats are available and you just walk in. 

They have everything here from cute house wares such as mugs, cooking utensils, etc. to jewelry, plushies, coin purses, golf balls, key chains, penny pushers, clothes for kids and adults, 

And ofcourse chocolate M&Ms!!! A huge wall of dispensers. $6.99 per half pound LOOOOL. whatever. It's just for fun I guess so why not just try it once. Many flavors, colors, and sizes you won't see on the normal market often. 

There are also printers to make custom sayings on the M&Ms, more expensive but a nice gift idea. 
Then there's M&Ms prepacked in pretty containers that are glass bottles, have shapes or designs on it , and can be reused for storing stuff. Those are worth the price because of the cute container and price per ounce of candy. 

Overall, this is a must stop for all candy lovers. Very colorful and cute. Lots of cute props for sight seeing. 
It's located on the strip and you can't miss it when walking around because of the huge M&M statues!
If you are looking for the PERFECT spot on Mt Washington, or maybe even all of Pittsburgh, this is your place.  The view is what drew us there, but the food is what will keep us going back. I can only speak for my own meal, which was the salmon, but I will assure you that THAT is how salmon is supposed to be prepared. It was absolutely phenomenal.. and I've eaten a lot of salmon- that was by far the best! Everyone else loved their meals as well, and finished every bite.  I had a red sangria as my drink and, again, it was perfect. 

Our service was totally on point, and that paired with our amazing view of our beautiful city couldn't have been better. 

Just a short walk from the top of the Duquesne Incline and the overlook, the location is very convenient and easy to find and get to. There is a parking lot right across the street that is $10 to use, but makes it much quicker and easier than searching for street parking.
Nice place. Relaxing and nice atmosphere. Free drinks and wifi too. Nails look great! What more do you need?
I am completely frustrated with this company!  My mortgage was bought\/transferred to them back in June and I transferred my Bill Pay service over to them.  When the date for my Bill Pay payment passed with no action on my account, I called their customer service department to find out what the problem was.  They immediately claimed that a payment was never sent to them (I have previously verified the payment with my bank) and would refuse to ask their cashier department to research the payment.  After several calls trying to get this resolved and two talks with their "leadership team" members I was able to get them to admit the payment was made on the date I said it was.  But that was not until after I had to send them a month's worth of my personal bank account transactions to include balances.  I think it's probably illegal for them to demand this type of personal information to resolve an error they made, but I felt I had no choice.  

Since then, they have incorrectly processed each of my additional mortgage payments.  They have processed my payments as principal only payments and not payments to my next due mortgage payment.  Again, their customer service department is of no help and guess what?  No supervisors are ever available to talk to a customer!

Bottom line, I think this company is out of control and probably not operating within the limits of the law.

UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE UPDATE  UPDATE

Within an hour of posting this review I did receive a call from one of Cunningham and Company's managers.  He promised to resolve these issues immediately and provided his direct contact information should I have continuing issues.  I am very pleased that someone within the company I reading these reviews and responding to them.  That's pretty cool!  And thank you Tammy for responding to my review as well.  That's service!
Burgatory makes a damn good veggie burger (it's vegan too!), with lots of great topping options. On Tuesdays, they also feature a vegetarian\/vegan special, and a vegan shake!!! They also seem to play some better music on Tuesdays; music for vegetarians (The Smiths, The Cure...). Even though this is a loud, happening place, they don't blast the music (like Mad Mex does). Also notable, is their house made shrub cocktails, though for the most part their cocktails are kinda weird, like immature, as in a teenager would love them; sweet and easy drinkin'. Servers are usually efficient. Expect a wait for dinner, especially on weekends.
Beau restaurant , bon plats ,  belle chorégraphie de balladie  faite  par les danseuses du restaurants qui invite les gens  à danser avec eux s' ils le désirent . C'est bien d'y aller pour une évènement spécial. 

J'ai adoré cérémonie pour verser  le thée  de menthe .
Solid Sichuan cuisine. I have no complaint at all with the food. Everything that I had ordered always came the way I imagined it to be. Most chinese restaurants in Toronto are inconsistent. On certain days, the food is too sweet, too salty, or just completely bland. I had never had this kind of consistency in Toronto chinese restaurants. Since this place is near work and I often get sichuan food craving for like every 3 days, I could say that I come here at least 10 times per month. Price wise, it is more expensive than the usual chinese food at china town, but the consistency is worth it.

My only complain is service. I kinda expected that the staff don't speak english at all, so I reverted back to chinese when speaking with them. However, it is still annoying when I eat dumplings covered in chili oil and found that my glass has no water. This is very obvious when I came late at night when the waiters are these two 20-something boys.

There was a time when I came around 45 minutes before they close. I ordered 3 dishes. 15 minutes afterwards, they handed me the check even when the last dish hasn't come out. I paid the bill. 5 minutes after I paid, my last dish came and it was a spicy wonton. Not long after, came a group of 4 international students from china. They came in like 15 minutes before closing time!!! WTF is that!? One of the waiter seems to be friend with one of the international students. Not long, both went smoking right outside the door. I would have been fine with that IF their door is tight. IT IS NOT!!! I could not taste my dumplings at all!! All I could taste is their smoke!!! I did not see a point to continue eating when I can't taste anything AT ALL!!!

I would recommend coming during the day when the waitresses are these middle age ladies. They seem to ATLEAST treat you like human, not some lump of protein. Next time I have Sichuan food craving, I would probably peek at the window and check who's working first before I walk in.
I went to the Rumbar for the first time yesterday and I was not disappointed. The bar staff was the epitome of mixology. I could have spent a few hours watching them expertly craft drinks alone.  They have one drink (The Shorty) that requires lighting a sage leaf on fire then covering it with a glass to add smoke flavor to it. Pure genius! Whomever came up with these recipes...  I applaud you.
Such a let down. From the service to the taste this place fell so flat. I will say that the inside of the restaurant is really cute. Very open, chic and inviting. But that's really the only thing worthy of stars. Our server was barely functioning- had zero enthusiasm and gave zero shits about giving us good customer service. Seemed like he had partied hard the night before. My boyfriend asked what kind of feedback customers gave about a certain dish and all he could muster was that a lot of people order it. So he ordered the truffled brioche and asparagus toast with fontina and egg which sounded great. And the food even looks really appetizing. Photo worthy for sure. But the food was soo bland. Neither of us could taste the truffle, and I love sweet and savory together but the brioche in this dish did not work. I ordered the brie and apple omelette off the healthy side of the menu which I expected to not taste as good as something more decadent but the eggs were so flavorless.  It seemed like there wasn't any brie inside the omelette, only one big piece on top. I also requested spinach be added, which it wasn't. I didn't want to wait for a new omelette so I asked for a side of vegetables which he declined to accommodate. We did not make very big dents in either of our dishes (which a good server should notice) but ours was completely oblivious to almost everything. He wasn't rude but needs a serious wake up call. This a breakfast place where everyone should have a sunny disposition and at least act like they've had a cup of coffee. For a place located on Scottsdale and Shea this was a pretty big disappointment. Save your time and money and eat elsewhere.
Came here last night with the husband and had a very positive experience. It was our wedding anniversary and we wanted to recreate a fabulous dim sum meal we had in Hong Kong during our honeymoon. Needless to say it didn't live up to that epic feast but it was absolutely delicious.

We had their specialty soup-filled pork dumpings, pan fried pork dumplings, onion pancake roll with beef, wontons in spicy peanut sauce, and green beans with dried shrimp. The pancake roll was so yummy and even better when dipped in a bit of vinegar to cut the fat. The true star however was the wontons in spicy peanut sauce, I've never had anything like it (waiter said it's another specialty of theirs), the sauce was spicy creamy and nutty and the wontons had a deliciously tender skin and yummy pork filling.

Everything was delivered in a very timely fashion - in fact I would stagger our order more next time so that we have more time between dishes. However it was all hot, with the desired accompaniments (some vinegar, chili oil etc.) and some ice cold Tsingtao to wash it all down. 

Worth noting near the end of our meal there was a lady yelling for the manager at the back of the room. She was relentless and tried to force her way into the back of the kitchen but the staff dealt with the situation very professionally. Our waiter apologized to us for the disruption rather than ignoring it which I appreciated. 

Total cost was around $70 for quite a lot of food (and a doggy bag), it's also much cleaner than most Chinatown restaurants. 

We will return!
Pretty great location. The drive-thru is usually speedy and my order is more often than not exactly as ordered. Employees are friendly, helpful, and exude customer service.
I don't often crave eastern Carolina barbecue but when I woke up this morning I had just two words running through my head: "Bill Spoon's".

Got there around 11:30 and was greeted by the friendliest people. Ordered the small plate with mac and cheese and potato salad. Don't you judge me.

My glass of sweet tea was never empty. My craving for hush puppies was met with an offer of some more. Yes, please!

Good food, served fast, from helpful and friendly people. Yellow checkered table cloths, wood paneled walls, ancient light fixtures that look like they belong in my momma's home. This is what the South is all about. At least, it should be.
Modern and open terminal. Stuck here on a four hour flight delay. Thank goodness there's free wifi.
First off, this place is great to go for a chimney cone! But it is not in the food court. It's up the stairs away from the food court in the corner. When you walk in there are 2 other businesses inside so make sure your in the right line. I ordered the original cone vanilla ice cream with a regular doughnut cone ($7) with cinnamon and sugar on the outside. The employees were very friendly! It was my first time trying one so I didn't want to get an extravagant one and not like it. But I loved it and would definitely go back to try their other flavors if I'm ever back in the area. I would love to see more of these in the US!!
A group of 4 of us went here in search of biscuits. Having recently been in the US, my companions had their fill of biscuits and fried chicken and were hungry for more, but it's not a popular cuisine in Montreal.
A quick Yelp search brought me to Triple Crown. We were not disappointed. Awesome service, great ambiance. Small dining room, tasty margaritas.
The menu was simple, pick your meat, pick your sides. Generous portions. The chicken was crispy and delish. The mash creamy, the mac and cheese cheesy, gravy thick, and the biscuits... oh the biscuits. "A cat's head" she told us, in response to the "how big are they" question. The chef, an expert, makes hundreds and hundreds a week, by hand. Buttery to the smell and to the taste. So good one of my group put one in her purse to take home. 
Will definitely be visiting again!
Got there and had to wait for a table, which is fine. However; no one went to clean it and we spoke to 3 people for a table and they'd just go on with their business and we just stood there and were kinda neglected for awhile. (That's why they lost a star). But once we sat, it was all smooth sailing from there. Our waitress was great, told us we ordered A LOT of food, so we took an app off, which was really nice of her:) The owner came over and joked around with us which was really nice. Food was AMAZING! Love the subtle fusion of Korean in there. Overall, we really enjoyed it and will definitely be going back! I know salads are pretty boring, but I loved my Kale and quinoa salad with grilled chicken! Also, Seoul Poutine is a must try and their pizza looked divine! See you guys again soon!
Worst baklava ever.  I've never had any this bad, not even from a mall food court place back when the Fiesta Mall still had Macy's.  The bottom layer was burnt.  The inner layers weren't golden and crispy but white and pasty.  The worst part was that it has NO honey or syrup at all on the inside layers.  None.  It was just layers of dry sheets of pale white dough and chopped nuts.  There was a tiny token drizzle on top that the cashier girl squeezed on it before she boxed it up, and that's it.  I don't think the layers of dough were brushed with butter either.  It's awful, and definitely not worth the $3.50 they're charging for two small triangular pieces.  Costco and AJ's both have superior product, and Costco even manages a shelf-stable baklava that is much more moist, even if not drenched in honey or syrup like some plates (most anything would be moister than this was).

I got the calamari again and the serving size was very small for the $9.50 they're charging (I'm pretty sure it's much smaller than what I got last time).  It could've used a crispier coating, and was slightly too rubbery.  The pita was still quite good.

They really need to get fabric or rubber pads for the metal feet of the chairs in the dining room as the noise against the flooring is awful.

I don't think I'll be back.  That truly bad baklava was so disappointing.
No signage on exterior or interior.  No hours or anything posted on exterior windows.  Door is locked.  Inside is empty except for one branded empty cardboard display.  Apparently this is "primarily their manufacturing facility" and they "aren't always there."  No answer when phone number was called.  Very disappointing!
Outstanding!!  Beet salad was small but amazing. Short ribs and scallops were also excellent. Service top notch. Beautiful inside and not noisy.  The portions are small but taste huge.
Wanted to love it because I like the decor and the location is great. They need to improve the food. I had chicken burritos and there was little chicken and dry crunchy rice. The wait staff was great. My companion had tacos and said there were dry also. With a few culinary improvements they would be great. It appeared they trying for a fancy taco experience and it wasn't a good fit.

New review a year later....much better food. Had the happy hour and the chicken taco Tinga. Much improved!
Have grabbed a quick bite to eat hear many times as it's right around the corner from me.

Always quick and friendly. Sometimes when I have my dog in the car they even give her a treat.
Decent Indian buffet but could be improved. On the positive side, the server was super friendly. The dishes are spicier than at most Indian restaurants which tend to water things down for us Americans. I really liked their version of chanamasala. Good flavor for most of the curries. 

Things to improve on:
- Buffet items not kept hot enough.
- The rice used is of poor quality, short or broken grains and dry. Really missed fluffy hot basmati rice.
- No Indian desserts. No kheer or gulabjamen.

We gave it a try as it is close by but would rather drive further to get a better overall experience in Indian buffet.
I was assigned the task of finding a place for our team at work to go to do some training and team bonding, and of course I turned to Yelp. 

After reading the reviews and checking out the website, I called and reserved tables in the "Villa Rosa" room.  Upon arrival, it was clear that this is a great room to use for such work tasks or meetings.  There are 3 tables in there that seat 4-6 people, with doors that can be closed if needed.  If you want privacy, reserve the whole room.  

Of course we had to start with some donuts, and I tried my hardest to resist them for as long as possible.  Several hours later, I dug into a chocolate on chocolate (go big or go home?) and it was everything I'd hoped for.  Yum!  I also had a green tea latte that was the best I've ever tasted!  

Our group stayed for lunch and everyone was happy with their choices, which were big portions for the price.  Service was fast and pleasant too.  

I hope to be back to spend another work day here!
I loved this hotel - 
The shopping is mah-velous. 
Your lobby pomander path is lovely and reminds me of a favorite bag.
Its kinda neat albeit it telltale to have a red card in your wallet - ha ha with my first 50 points I won lots of slot play! YAY!
The room was gorgeous - brown wallpaper and vanilla furniture, bright prints lit individually, remote controlled room temp, shades. The bathroom's double sink and middle vanity were nice, shower and soaking tub and TV and phone - and your toilet seats are my favorite of ALL the hotels I've ever enjoyed.
Everyone, from bell at our taxi, registration, red card, game floor assistance, cocktail waiters, was wonderful. I was surprised to get greeted by a couple staff just walking through.
I'll have to try the spa and pool one next time.
Its close to hot clubs of the moment - surrender and XS.
Only thing I'd say to my fellow yelpers - at check-in ask which side you're on and opt for a upgrade to a higher floor if you aren't planning on staying out all night. It got kinda loud because of the club and stayed loud until 3am. =) good for us - just might not work for some.
Food was okay. I feel like this place was overrated especially for the prices. Not in a rush to return
I'm not really a fan I have to say. I was really excited when my food arrived in 15 minutes... like really excited. That's Jimmy John's delivery quick. It looked very well packaged but that's about where the experience stops being fantastic.

I love my spice... don't get me wrong. I usually order my Thai on the high end of the spice scale. Spice is a great way to get a flavorful dish. It also can reveal the caliber of the place you are ordering from. Typically a take out Chinese establishment is not going to offer a scale for their spice. It's not a Thai restaurant. They simply indicate with a little pepper when something is going to be spicy.

My dish which was a scallop dish was very overpowering on the spice end, and not in a good way. The spice completely overpowered my food and any good flavor that could've resulted. 

I may try it again and order a non spicy dish to see how that ends up, but for now, it's out of rotation on my take out list.
We ordered half the menu here and honestly can not say anything really bad. Tonkatsu was prepared jusr right, light and crispy batter. The japanese curry was the best I had in the city. Beef tataki was tasty and tofu, we couldnt get enough. The potato salad had the right amount of dashi and sweetness,  chicken karaagi was slightly salty for my taste. The best part about this place aside from the amazing food, they served everything like how you would get it in Tokyo and you prepare your own katsu sauce. Definetely going on the fav list!
I enjoyed this show! It was a great variety, hence the name. It goes faster than it seems, cause its very entertaining. From acrobatics, to humor, to crazy stunts, it'll keep you on edge. Seating is comfortable. Sometimes confetti will be thrown at the audience.  Before entering the show, you can also get your photo taken (not free of course). The line started earlier than expected, and probably was waiting there for about 45 minutes. Going in the building was dark, so watch your step! Definitely an experience worth having for all members and ages of the family.
I've had my eye on this place ever since I saw the sign put up ages ago. I've been hunting, searching.... trying to find any piece of information I could. And then about a month ago an opening date was given. It was also then I discovered that it was being opened by the owners of Not Too Shabby on Cave Creek Rd. 

I was a bit worried at first that it was going to be a beautiful store, but nothing that fit my mid-century modern feel. That still didn't keep me from being breathtaken today when I swung in to see if I could find a lil something for myself.. and walked out with a few items.

The vibe is like a yard sale and really makes you feel at home. The employees have some pretty swanky aprons I want to steal for my kitchen and are super helpful. Even when you don't think to open a book to check for the price. And even when they said they'd been eyeing one of the items you purchased, wanting to get it in a week or so.

There are tons of items from the 30s-60s mainly, from farmer to modern. There's some new items too, with that old feel, such as jewelry. But mainly, this is stuff I've had a hard time finding on 7th Ave, and at a better price. 

You can tell a lot of attention was made to purchases and decor and that everyone there cares.

I didn't expect to purchase Mr. Boston's De Luxe Official Bartender's Guide.. or the steel mik crate and bottles... but I'm sure I'll find a place for them. They are lovely.
I have some mixed feeling about this place.... 

When it comes to the staff - 5 Stars! They are over the top, bend over backwards nice\/friendly. They go above and beyond to make sure your meal\/experience is a good one. 

When it comes to the food - it breaks down in two sections. Let's start off with the 5 star section. 

The bread (I know who rates the bread...me) is delicious. I could make a meal of just eating a loaf or two. And the penne ala vodka is lick the bowl good. The pasta is homemade and the sauce is perfect. Literally I wanted to lick the bowl :-) Oh and the pear four cheese ravioli - OH MY GOD - It was brought out for us just to sample with our meals. So rich and delicious, I was cursing myself that I didn't order it as my main meal. 

However the fried shrimp, bruschetta and risotto ball is about three stars. The shrimp and risotto ball were a bit over fried and greasy for me and the bruschetta was a bit dry. The salad and steak were also three stars. The salad was average - nothing too exciting on the place. And the steak was just so-so. Sadly, I could have cooked a better one at home (for a third of the price). Not to mention, I really didn't like the sides - roasted potato and a sprinkling of mixed vegetables. Again, nothing to write home about.
Food was great the service was awesome. Our waiter was so friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, he was also funny. The food came fast and it was so delicious, definitely going back
I CANNOT believe no one has raved about MBG on Yelp yet. This is not your typical gym. No machines, no tvs. They are all about functional fitness...getting in shape and working up as sweat with things like large ropes, ladders, kettle bells, and medicine balls. 

The owner, John, and his girlfriend, Jessica are super cool and supportive. They are all about health and encouraging Madisonians to get healthy, the right way! 

If you're looking for a different kind of workout or just something new to try, head to MBG! This place is amazing!!
Came in, bought a truck with a tow package. Took it for a test drive and double checked to make sure it had a hitch. Talked price, had to renegotiate price, they took it to the back to "detail it" Got home and noticed the tow package was gone. What, did it fall off? I'd bet not. Plus they tried to finance the truck with them rather than my credit union who waited a WEEK for the contract. I had to call multiple times, they fired the guy who was financed it on a separate issue...Shady ass shit going on here, go somewhere else. 

Update-
THEY STILL HAVE NOT FULLY PAID OFF MY TRADE IN!!! THEY OWE 152$ TO MY CREDIT UNION. 
ALSO,
Took my truck in cause the breaks were squeaking, only had this truck for a month, 400$ warped front rotors replacement and new shoes. Plus the 150$ to replace the tow hitch. WATCH OUT!!!! THEY DO BAD BUSINESS AND STEAL FROM YOU!!!
You gotta be sometun homesick local boy foh da kine heya brah! Da kine no ono, no  broke da mouth, but cheap brah gotta coupon!

This little Hawaiian style food spot is like Zippy's in Aiea with 5% of the menu, embedded in the California Casino in Old Town Las Vegas. The hotel\/casino caters to Hawaiians, with special deals with Hawaiian Airlines, coupons for food, etc, along with the Main Street Station across the street. This part of Vegas is like Reno, small, walkable, a little carnival\/state fair like, with the covered and lighted Fremont Experience nearby being the main attraction, and very affordable compared to the huge properties on the south end of Las Vegas Blvd. Cheap table games here, too, like $5 craps and blackjack, even on weekends, with usually better odds. 

You line up here just off the casino floor and order over the counter cafeteria style, pay at the end, and get staples dishes like rice plates, bento, saimin, and other kamaina favorites. 

I got the special bento, which was chicken katsu, beef teriyaki, and of course Spam! ($6.95 without coupon!) Two scoops of rice island style, and you have the ubiquitous Hawaiian plate lunch. 

Hay sistah, watta happen da kine macaroni?

What's a Hawaiian plate lunch without a scoop of macaroni salad? I was disappointed! 

90%, no wait a minute, maybe 99%  of the people in line were Hawaiian. All the cooks were Asian and all the register girls were Filipina, like Cecilia. 

Although a quick cafeteria style place, your order here is still a little Island time, brah! So wait before your wave comes, bruddah!
Just and Update....Stopped back in to The Porter's House for a Birthday Cocktail for My Sisters Birthday....We all ordered a different drink\/all were fantastic. We had the best Server named Charlene! She made the night...We had a couple of appetizers and we were taken care of perfectly!! Like I said before...Try this new venue...its great!
The first time I checked this place out, I was slighty confused about the menu and pizza choices.  Not your typical pizza\/wine bar menu (turns out to be a good thing!).  We came at a busy time, and I feel like the wait staff didn't take the time to explain the menu to us.  We ended up ordering the thicker pizza, which was pretty good.  

The several times after that we tried a few different items, and loved them!  The Rustica is perfect for one, thin and cheesy.  I also love the Caesar Salad served in a pizza dough bowl....yummy!  On the last visit we tried the Mac and Cheese, which was thick, full of chedder flavor, and just crisp enough on top.  Definitely enough to share!

The wine list is pretty extensive, but too pricey by the glass.  The Pinot Grigio I had was $8.00 and nothing special.  It's also disappointing that the happy hour is half off bottles, rather than the glass.  

The service is definitely slower than average, which was okay.  And if you go on a busy Saturday night, the place gets very, very loud.   Luckily, the pizza makes up for it!
This office is the friendliest, most efficient Drs office I have ever been to! They keep their appt schedule but yet you do not feel rushed and you feel well cared for. They appear to review your profile prior to arrival and actually know why you are there and are prepared for you! Love Dr Blair and his staff.
The vibe of this place is the real draw.  It has an intimate, almost jazz club feel, rather than the typical Vegas dance-oriented night club.  I like the piano and the singers they have.  All that being said, the drinks (and I'm assuming food, as well) are expensive, so plan accordingly.  I think there was a cover charge, as well, when I went (though I can't remember what it was).  Interesting place, but be sure to bring a fresh credit card with you.
-Torta Coreana $10: the sandwiches were huge and it will definitely filled you up! They were a bit messy to eat with the meat juices dripping. Although the braised beef was tender and melted in your mouth, I found it to be lacking in salt and it was very rich due to the avocado. Since I couldn't find any pickled pear, I wish there was more kimchi to cut down the heaviness of the sandwiches. 

-Braised Short-rib $5: the braised meat was flavorful and juicy, topped with fresh onions and cabbage. The marinate was sweet and there was a subtle hint of spiciness. To be honest I think there was too much cabbage, and is it just me or I think adding fresh cabbage as topping to any dish is unnecessary? Sure, it provide some crunchy texture, but it add nothing to the dish in terms of flavor, unless you cook it down or toss it in some sauce.

-Bulgogi Shrimp El Diablo $8: My favorite, albeit it is pricier compared to other taco dishes on the menu, but it was worth it. The taco shell was a bit oily and messy to eat, but the shrimp was amazing!! Cooked perfectly, mixed in this an amazing red sesame spicy sauce and I believe there was some guacamole! 

-Chicken Kampungki $5: The crispy chicken pieces were not as spicy as I expected, and while the aoili added a lovely creamy texture, it didn't have that "spicy" wasabi taste to it. Overall, I didn't think there was anything special with this dish, it was just like any regular chicken kampungki for me.

-Churros Poutine $9: The churros were "fries", the melted marshmallow resembled cheese curds and the caramel sauce was "gravy"! I can definitely tell the churros were made fresh as these came out piping hot, however I was disappointed as these churros were a bit hard. Anyhow, while the poutine concept was fun and quirky, this dessert was expensive and it didn't worth the $9 price tag for me.

-Grilled Kalbi Beef Ribs $14: Ok $14 was a bit expensive when you can just go down the street for a cheaper and bigger portion of Kalbi ribs. The ribs were cooked through with the marinade caramelized, deliciously tender and had that traditional Kalbi marinade - sweet and salty. Surprisingly the kimchi wasn't spicy, and it added a fresh and cool touch that helped ease the heat from the salsa for every bite.

-Pulpo Al Carbon $6: Who doesn't love octopus and chipotle!? This was another favorite dish of mine and I was surprised to see a huge piece of octopus, so for $6 it was worth it! The octopus was grilled lightly, not rubbery nor tough, instead it was tender and citrusy. The chipotle added creaminess and worked perfectly with the octopus, just pure deliciousness.

The service was friendly and attentive, and most of the tacos were really good with a few favourites. If you want to avoid the crowd and noises, I advise you to visit the restaurant during lunch as the restaurant is usually packed at night.
I went to Morgan's with my grandma.  Morgan's was recommended to her by her doctor.  She has a very wide foot and struggles to find shoes that fit her.  When we went into Morgan's it was a little overwhelming, it's a big store.  I went straight to the sales counter to ask for help and they were happy to oblige.  A very friendly and patient sales woman brought us around and helped my grandmother try on several pairs of shoes.  Later another sales person came over and helped us (we needed to special order so we needed to speak to someone who specialized in special orders) with the shoe she wanted and also recommended some socks.  I would recommend Morgan's to someone looking for hard to find sizes and widths.
New favorite spot! Can't wait to bring my husband here because he's going to love it!! 

Came here with my mom and we both fell in love with this place. Our entire dining experience was fabulous from start to finish.

Let's begin with dessert - - because who doesn't love dessert?!? We split the beignets and they were to die for! We were literally "oohing" and "ahhing" as we devoured them. When you take a bite, lo and behold you encounter perfectly caramelized bananas foster. Paired with the crispy dough of the beignet it's spectacular. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. As if that isn't enough, they serve them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. AND the portion is huge -- they tempt you with not one, not two, not three, but FOUR large beignets! This is a dish that four people could split. Well, the two of us tore them up and ate all four. (They wouldn't be good as leftovers...or at least that's what we told ourselves.)

We must've been hungry or tempted by their menu because we still made it to dessert despite splitting several appetizers and sharing an entree. 

Let's talk appetizers. Stuffed mushrooms -- so good I was dipping the bread they served them with in the butter, garlic sauce. Fried green tomatoes with guacamole - win; plus, who can pass on that amazing combo. Duck fries - super yummy and the sauce they came with was awesome. 

After all that, we split the beef shoulder entree. It was so soft, tender and the mashed potatoes and roasted root vegetables were perfect. 

Food and service alone were five stars. I also love the decor because everything is tastefully themed with pigs ("sow"). Even the restrooms have cute decals, one with a pig in red heels and one with a boar. 

I had such a great dining experience here! Next time, I can't wait to try their award winning deviled eggs. I'll be sure to leave room for dessert again!
Snotsdale at its finest! This place is a large bar\/night club that was built by Danny, of Danny's car wash fame, who made millions keeping cars clean against the dust storms and monsoons of the Valley of the Sun, and needed a good place where he could go dancing with his woman. 

It actually is a restaurant, too. The food is Ok. The Paella is huge and not bad. They try real hard to make this place the chi-chi joint for the hip resort\/snowbird crowd. It is huge, with several dining areas and bars, a large patio, and a small stage and decent dance floor. They usually have live music on the weekends and intersperse with Disco DJs. On weekends you have cowgirls walking around with their "shooters" holsters and shot glasses thru the 4 bars. A lot of the waitresses (not just here, but in most of Snotsdale's higher end joints) are part time ASU coeds trying to make a buck to buy more short skirts and halter tops at the mall. 

Everyone at night is pretty much trying to create an impression beyond their true reality, whether it is the young diggers or the old farts. If you are from Dallas or Calgary, you will probably like this place for its unapologetic panash for conspicouus consumption.  

The food and drinks are overpriced; the eye candy plentiful; and reality is far, far away. Bring your Cheesehead friends from Wisconsin in November and they will be impressed.
Terrible service if you are Asian. When we first walked in,  we were asked whether we had a reservation and we didn't.  We left and called and told there was plenty of space and so we went back. After looking forward to eat some fondue,  it came and had such a strong white wine flavor which meant it hadn't fully evaporated.  It was super disappointing because there was no mention of white wine in the description at all. We thought our waitress had removed it from the bill so when we asked her she said she forgot to add it. We then said that it should be because it was not advertised and we barely ate it. She was clearly unhappy and we just got attitude thereafter.  Little did she know we would have left a big fat tip if she didn't give us the unnecessary attitude when we were polite the entire time and clearly did not like the fondue! It was barely touched! French onion soup was okay,  lobster bisque was okay and the crepes were good. Don't expect great service if you're asian as was confirmed by a fellow local resident. Super disappointed.
Great regular pizza, horrible gluten free pizza. I don't want to judge this place too harshly on something that's not what the restaurant is all about but it's important for people seeking gluten free pizza to know. If I were them I wouldn't even carry this product at all. The dough is so flat and has a really weird after taste. Most places seem to use the same frozen rounds and they just don't cut it. I know GF will never replace pizza and there is only so much you can do but I really challenge this place to come up with a mix and bake fresh made pies. If I can do it in my home anyone can do it. The demand for GF alternatives is only growing and if you can have an edge on something like that it would set you apart from others. Maybe the owners should just try the GF crust and see what I mean. For having such amazing regular pizza they should at least try to put out a better quality product.
Unique inspired tapas- elegant rustic home cooked feel!!

The hunny drove me randomly out to fountain hills one date night.  He could not recall the name of the restaurant so I was getting a little frustrated!!!!

We came in here- he finally found it!  What a yummy gem!

Pros:
Zucchini
Corn cob
Bacon wrapped dates 
Red sangria

We also had the pork pernil- very good too! 

This restaurant had a great staff, helpful server who gave us space but checked in at all the right times.  This is a perfect date night or family spot.

We ate our zuchinni so quickly the first time we ordered a second plate.  The flavors of everything were so unique but balanced you didn't want to stop eating.

Next time we must get dessert!! I can only imagine!
The concept of seafood boil is to get messy, no utensils are provided.. So I don't understand why everyone is complaining that this place is messy lol. 

*The restaurant actually provided a bucket for seafood shells, thus keeping the table quite clean. 
*Seafood are delivered to the restaurant at 3:30PM daily right before opening to ensure maximum freshness
*The oyster are from Diana's Seafood. 
*Price is a bit cheaper than Captain's Boil, but this isn't something that you can eat every day, more like once in a while with families. 
*I prefer Boil Bar more because the flavors are better, more prominent. Captain's Boil was just pure raw garlic sauce... Garlic breath alert!! 

-Mussel with sweet corn and sausage (Garlic Sauce - a bit spicy)
I love how the garlic sauce wasn't overpowering with just a hint of heat - complimented perfectly with the well-cooked mussels!

-Clams with sweet corn and sausage (house sauce - mild spicy)
These were a bit annoying to eat at times as I would get empty shells at times and have to dig through the bag for those tiny clams. Otherwise, the house sauce was flavorful but it was spicier than what I expected! I'm not too sure what kind of spices they used here, but there was a hint of cumin that lingered at the back of my throat. 

-Craw fish with sweet corn and sausage (cajun sauce - mild spicy)
Anyhow, to eat crawfish, after you peel the tail you must try sucking the head! It's not gross at all, you are simply tasting the juice from the boil combined with some of the fat from the crawfish. The crawfish was cooked well they were able to soak up that delicious cajun sauce.

-Baked Lobster
There was a thick layer of creamy cheese and mayonnaise on top of a perfectly cooked lobster. I love that they pre-cracked the claw, so I didn't have to struggle so much to grab those sweet lobster meat out of the claws ;). I think it would have been even better if they sprinkled panko on top for some texture though. I noticed that other than the claw meat, there wasn't much lobster meat anywhere else so do take note of that.

-King crab leg with sweet corn and sausage (lemon pepper sauce)
I didn't find the lemon pepper sauce to be spicy and the pepper was almost nonexistent. They gave us extra lemon to add more flavor but I felt it wasn't needed. I like that the sauce was light and enhanced the natural sweetness of the crab meat.


-Sizzling chicken plate (Similar to Aka teppan)
The portion here was smaller and I found that the meat - in this case chicken - was already cooked and the hot plate was there just to warm up the food. Nonetheless, I liked that the chicken had a light breading and the skin crisped up from the heat, while still maintained moisture on the inside.

-Grilled Sweet Corn
Similar to MeNami. But this one was softer and not as crunchy as Menami.
Here's a secret no one will ever tell you when you become a first time mom.  Buy EVERYTHING used for items your baby needs during his first to second year of life because that darn kid will grow out of his clothes so fast that your head will be spinning when the next day he is too big for that six pairs of pants you just bought him the day before.
And he will be so unpredictable in what he likes in toys that $100 you just spent on toys you THOUGHT he would spend months playing, he doesn't even acknowlege its existence after 15 minutes.  
Hence the smartness of shopping at a store like Kid to Kid- buy it, let your kid play with it- then bring it back for consignment.  The store is really well organized and most of the items look new.  The clothes if not bought on sale can be not so much a bargain because a lot of them are designer brands but if you get to the store on a sale day, then you are in luck!
If you are looking for a pleasant place to stay with a very casual atmosphere, The Cal is the play to be!  

My wife and I stayed here over labor day weekend as it was the most reasonably priced hotel I could recognize (there's a ton of cheaper places, but in Vegas, you just don't want to take 'that' gamble).  

The room was roomy, pleasantly decorated and the beds were super comfy.  The valet staff was relaxed yet expedient in taking and retrieving my vehicle.  The restaurant was modestly priced, if not cheap!  Their breakfast buffet was small, but perfect!  For about $7 you get coffee and all you can eat yummy breakfast food!  I just keep telling folks, all the staff wears Hawaiian shirts, so of course their at ease.  

I also appreciate that the Cal hasn't resorted to the obnoxious gimmicks that the other downtown hotels have resorted to.  It's a comfortable place to stay, a friendly place to gamble and I feel welcomed as a guest.
Probably the most upscale movie theater I've ever been to. You'll definitely want to reserve tickets well in advance and if you want the fancy seats you'll pay more. 

Food and drink menu is quite lavish. I had a coconut\/pineapple mocktail that was awesome. I would definitely order it again. My husband had a cocktail he enjoyed too. All of the food was excellent. Definitely pricey but you're paying for the service and convenience. 

Very nice place to come for special occasions!
I've been to Vegas many times but never to Harley-Davidson...until this weekend. I must say, I am definitely a fan! Everyone in my party raved about their mac n' cheese so of course, I have to order it! It definitely lived up to the hype...OMG! SO good! I loved the motorcycle displays and staff was really attentive\/friendly.

I would recommend for a cool\/laid back place to eat on the strip!
Great place for wood-fired pizza! I had heard some great things about Humble Pie and I wanted to finally try it out. Came for for the lunch special which is a 10 inch pizza and a soup or salad. I opted for the Meat lovers pizza with artichoke which was pretty good and overall satisfying. 

Server was very kind but it seemed they may have been understaffed as he was the only server working at the time. 

Not a bad price for the lunch special and the 10 inch pizza along with the soup was more than enough to be filling. 

Not my favorite pizza joint, but would definitely come back for more!
Not bad in ambiance and price was not high. I enjoyed the spicy lemongrass and jalepeno chicken I chose. I would eat here again. Service was fine.
First the service was great and helpful. The drunken noodles are amazing and also great reheated the next day!
Fast staff, friendly smiles. They brew multiple coffees. They have Casi Cielo on draft now! Cominig from a Starbucks partner this is a quality store.
I give this place two stars. It's sad bc I would have loved to give them more. However, despite their delicious pizza, the girls I spoke with in the store tonight had TERRIBLE attitudes. Apparently they have recently changed the hours and they close at 10 instead of 11 now (but the yelp\/map for iPhone hasn't changed the times). I called at 9:50 and was told "we're closed". As annoying as it is to have a customer call that close to the closing time and order, if you're open til 10, YOURE OPEN UNTIL 10. Then the worker (Jacqueline) HUNG UP ON ME. I called back and spoke with the MOD (Lauren) who told me they weren't taking orders because they shut the ovens down because they hadn't an order in over 45 minutes... I will be calling to speak to the owner tomorrow to let him know that it's not good business practices and it's definitely terrible customer service to hang up on a potential customer. did I mention I was a POTENTIAL customer?! Won't be calling back there to place an order again... Ugh.
I love a good burger! Can't say I love this place.

I was excited to try this place when it opened. I made one visit there and haven't been back since. 

I don't remember what I ordered as it was sometime ago. Obviously was unimpressed with their burger. I do recall throwing the fries away they were disgusting enough to be memorable.

On the plus side the place was neat and clean, The staff was friendly and quick enough. The food just didn't appeal to me.

Would I give it another try? I just don't think so unless someone else was buying.
I have always liked the Bebe woman. 

It's not for everyone. Bebe's fashions are young, hip, a little edgy, confident, body conscious, and sexy. The quality isn't high end or sophisticated, its affordable for a younger demographic. 

Although they always have a sexy, splashy, sometimes a little puzzling image in their display ads at bus stops, store fronts and magazines,  a lot of what they sell is basics, like black tops, leather mini-skirts, lacy dresses, mix and match tops and bottoms, high heeled and boots complimenting clothes for the junior body. 

Where as H&M is great for the practical straight shooting Suzy needing to go to work on a budget,  Bebe is her naughty, but not quite wild, friend who likes to strut her stuff off a little after 5. 

It's like a Forever 21 with a little more discerning taste, better quality of clothes, and a lot  more cooler than your average Juniors store.. 

Bebe is best for juniors, petites and woman who are in shape. There are those who think they are this, and you got to love their attitude and confidence, but I have seen Bebe glittered tops and other body conscious pieces on women who have either a fun house mirror, or mirror mirror on the wall, and that is not reality. They should go to Nordstrom's, STAT! Or if they're older, maybe even Chico, where a size 5 is really a size 10 or there abouts. Graduate into Misses fashion, instead of trying to force feed that body into tight fitting, bulge producing, muffin top junior number.  Hey any woman can look fabulous, just wear the styles that fit your body, not the other way around. 

This Bebe's is just south of The Strip, not far from the Rental Car center of McCarran. It's in one of those Malls that wants to be a Downtown City in the suburbs, like many of the newer malls going up now. This would be like Santana Roa in San Jose or Bay Street in Emeryville in the Bay Area, or in Rancho Cucamonga and other eastern burbs in SoCal. 

And true to their image and target customer, this Bebe's had a couple of hot, young girls working there with great figures and nice personalities, well, nicer than in a designer boutique and more attentive than at Macy's, and a lot more available than at H&M. One Filipino, the other Vietnamese, the manager Caucasian, and all 3 petite. 

Which is why 2 out of 3 were wearing the exact same jaguar print new platform\/spiked 5 inch high heels that girls are tripping all over themselves trying to wear, as they are in fashion right now. We might see a few broken ankles, maybe a few broken necks, before that fashion ebbs away. 

It's hard to have that Bebe swagger when you think you are going to fall with every step! Some of these girls walk like a broom is shoved up there....well, you've seen it, you know what I mean! 

My favorite relative opted for a high heel for her prom dress, but it was a zig-zag large ribbon strappy number, perfect for spring, fuschia in color with silver soles, and wrapped above the ankle with a secure velcro clasp, offering her a little more stability perched on those heels she wasn't really used to yet..

$115 for the pair, and she is happy. Good thing I won at the Craps table, so I can smile too.  

Another Bebe girl in the making?
 
Yeah, maybe. But it's Ok with me.
A bit claustrophobic inside but a nice lunch spot. I'll suggest taking it to-go and find somewhere else to sit. Small patio gets crowded as well during the lunch rush. The chicken blt was a good choice, however it looked like the tuna tacos should've been the choice I made.
I absolutely love this place! Aesthetically it is very cute, clean, unique, and well lit. Every single staff member I have interacted with has been very professional and pleasant. My mani\/pedi always looks great. I've been waxed there and had a good experience with that as well. The leg\/foot messages are lengthy and phenomenal. I'm a nurse and work two jobs so I always love a good foot rub :) Even when I don't do gel, my manis last for over a week. 
It's kind of expensive, but you get what you pay for and this place is worth it!
Walked in off the street to grab some sushi.  Sat down in front of Mark the sushi chef and had an incredible sushi experience.  Everything was top notch, super fresh and the timing was great too!  Highly recommend you check this place out!
I love this pastry shop.The place is beautiful and minimalistic; good spot to catch up with a friend. I'm so happy and proud that Patrice is a Quebecer and has decided to open his own store in Little Burgundy. Yes, his desserts are pricey but oh so worth it. They're the perfect cheat snacks. From the generous soft cookies filled with chocolate morsels to the must-have Kouign Amann (a very buttery sweet croissant with a perfectly crispy exterior), you really can't go wrong.
My family wanted to show us a great time in Pittsburgh after Christmas and they brought us to Eddie Merlot. I Our first impression was not great as the valets ignored us while they watched a fight that had broken out across the street at in front of McDonald's. Our waiter was too familiar in how he addressed us and he did not fix things that were clearly subpar---e.g., my Manhattan cocktail that was brought to me half full, sans cherries, even though I had asked for extra cherries. We all made comments about it and he ignored us and, throughout the meal, we had to flag down another server to have an issue addressed, such as extra salad dressing. Many steaks had to be sent back for being improperly cooked and my ribeye, the only steak I ever order, was ok and not well marbled. The sides were good. 
For the price of this meal I expected much better quality food and much more attentive and professional service. This was NOT value for money. 2.3 stars is the accurate rating so I rounded down.
My husband and I had a gift card and decided to come here for his birthday. This was our first time coming to Melting Pot. The first thing I noticed is how underwhelming the decor inside the restaurant is- for such an expensive experience, you would think the ambiance would be modern. Our waiter was nice and attentive- we also got our picture taken but never saw it at the end of the night. Our waiter explained the cooking process and options on the menu, including drinks. We went with the 4 course option and stated with the fontina cheese fondue. Neither my husband or I liked it- it's a very pungent flavor. One thing we learned quickly is if you want something cooked, it needs to be at the very bottom of the pot (raw veggies served in the first course don't taste good with hot cheese in my opinion). Anyways, next were salads, which we LOVED. I ordered the California and he ordered the Apple Bacon. I literally want to make the raspberry vinaigrette dressing at home because it was THAT good! Next was the meat course- I went with the pacific rim (pot-stickers, duck, sirloin and shrimp)- hubby had the land and sea (filet, shrimp, and chicken). We went with the mojo sauce to cook the meat and it provided some flavor but not a lot. We ended up adding other flavors in the pot to make the flavors pop. The sauces they provide on the side are very good, especially the greek goddess sauce for the mushrooms- stuff them after they cook and they are amazing! 

Take away from this dining experience- I know it's supposed to be an "experience" cooking your food but when you only get 2 skewers at a time, it takes FOREVER to get through all the meat and veggies they give you on the side to cook. The potatoes were in the pot from the beginning of the meat cooking process and they never really cooked all the way through- why potatoes? By the time we finished dinner, we were exhausted and hot (the cooking pot being in front of you for 2+ hours makes the space a little toasty). 

For dessert, we went with the smores fondue, which was the best thing we ate all night. It came with brownies, strawberries, pineapple, banana, shortcake and rice krispies. It was also nice because it came on a happy birthday plate and we sang to my husband for his birthday. We also had a coupon for chocolate covered strawberries and received a box at the end of dinner (call ahead for those though). And, if you check in on Yelp, you get a free bottle of the garlic and wine seasoning. 

I can't say the service or food wasn't great because it was and I have no complaints there. My husband and I both agreed we just didn't enjoy the 2.5 hour dinner experience enough to come back. We also thought it was really expensive ($125 for 2 people). I'm glad we tried this but I don't know if we would really want to come back.
In my honest opinion you are better off driving the extra miles to the one in Henderson. I ordered garlic knots TWICE and they completely forgot. My husbands calzone was barely even half full.. talk about a dough ball. The food came out pretty fast and that's the only reason they got two stars.
Tried their SinCity Burger Combo..pretty good! I love their bun. The burger is pretty big so it will fill you up!

Their fries are good as well!

I'd give this place a try!
I visted Las Vegas from Chicago, I was looking for a good nail salon in this area for my wedding party. I came to the Nail Bar based on fhe reviews on Yelp. They did not disappoint me. I like the way the take care of my nails. The staffs are friendly, and know what they do. I have a party of 5 and they were able to accommodate all of us at the same time
We are very happy that we picked the right salon this time
One of the most relaxing places that's within biking distance from my house. I, am indeed, one lucky gal! 

While it's not huge, the farm can keep me occupied for hours on end. I just love the serenity and beauty of it all, and taking time to breathe deeply and enjoy the little things in life. 

The Maya Farm apparently has amazing CSA shares I am going to buy into shortly that include flowers. I buy myself flowers every week, so this is a super fantastic deal :)

The little art shops and gardens are just beautiful and everyone is so nice and kind. I spent quite a bit of my stay there today playing with an adorable boston terrier. 

Downfall is the lack of good places I felt safe parking my bike. Bonus is I just brought it with me (consider it my dog) wherever I traveled. 

I will be back here... again.. and again.. it's a great weekend morning trip. I took some fantabulous photos today.
It was picking up my number and such for a 5k that made me finally swing by The Runner's Den. Having an excuse to walk around the store and check out the wares, the end result was that it was okay, but still made me miss other running stores I had come to love and adore.

Some of the perks?
** When I was finally able to get the attention of an employee to try on some Five Fingers, he was super nice and knowledgeable. We shared running stories and talked about techniques and workshops available through the store.
** They have group runs as well as classes on form and technique that are free. Considering I run like a buffoon, this may do me some good.

Some of the not so good?
** Parking is atrocious. Luckily my little car fit into a spot on the side that requires tetris-esque skill to get in and out of.
** Staff was pretty hard to find. Not sure if they're always that busy or just were because people were picking up race packs, but it took nearly 20 minutes to get someone's attention.
** Neither the running shoe or even the brand I wear seemed to be available. 

It will probably be a good place to pick up the little things like goo, a new visor or running shirt, socks, etc... but not sure it will be my first choice for anything major, like a new pair of shoes.
Awesome show! So many finds for yourself or for gifts!

Not to mention the food! You can make a meal out of sampling here, and everything is gourmet. I bought some incredibly delicious pear flavoured balsamic vinegar that will be fantastic in salad dressings. 

The show is huge so I would suggest taking a look through the map and vendor lists before you head off in a certain direction. I was there on a weekday evening and it was comfortably busy, not overly crowded. 

Definitely recommend going - I will be back next year!
I really hate buffets - I really really do hate them. I don't know why I even step foot in them - maybe because they are really the only place that offers breakfast super early in Vegas?? The food is never good and I never eat enough for what I am paying for. With that being said - $18 for a western omelet and a glass of water is a little crazy - not the buffets fault - but it still rubs me wrong.

As far as the food is concerned - or should I say the omelet - average nothing to write home about. I didn't even try anything else because it all looked shriveled up...like it was sitting under a heat lamp way to long :-(
What a shame. It has been 3 years since Mumford and Sons have been to Phoenix and they played at this mess of a venue. We had lawn seats and it was a cluster. We could barely hear the band out on the lawn. How they played for 90 minutes without someone who worked at the venue making any adjustments is beyond belief. It also took an hour to get out of the parking lot. Totally disorganized, never again!
It's school time!

Grab your pens, pencils or hell why not grab a pint glass and take in the professional instructors!

This place is legit, in house craft beer that really leaves you wanting more. A full bar is available if you are not the beer guru, with wine and spirits. The staff here brew onsite really put their heart and soul into what they produce. Guest beer on tap is also available from other brewery's which mixes it up.

They also offer you some really awesome food options, I highly recommend the SW pontine, a great southern mix of Canadian mex that will leaving you wanting more.

Knowledgeable staff and good food really makes for a wicked brew pub that can rival any other in the area.

Overall:
Food: 5-5
Drink: 5-5
Service: 5-5
Coming back: you know it!
I wish I could give this a 3.5 rating.  I'd never even heard of poutine until a friend recommended this place.  We ended up going together and sharing one, since I had eaten not long before arriving.  Let me preface this review with this: I'm a SUPER healthy eater, as a rule - so this is not something I'd eat all the time (hence the low-ish rating).  But I did enjoy it; both of us did.  It doesn't say so on the menu, but you can change up the sauces on whatever poutine you get, so be sure to try the mushroom sauce.  That was my favorite part about it!  If you're in Vegas and you're looking for some poutine, this is the place to go.  And, as a fun touristy item of note, you'll be parked right next to the world famous Pawn Stars pawn shop.
This is one huge casino. I've been in here many times over the years. 

This casino has a great location. You could spend your entire vacation here and never leave the hotel.

I've seem several concerts here as well. Great venue!
I stopped in to check out the prices on some televisions. They have a lot to choose from, but the prices are better at Costco. They have decent prices on kitchen appliances. I think I will go with Costco.
This Jack's is not on the glitzy Las Vegas Strip.

No. It is on the more grittier, east side of The Strip. Where illegal immigrants meet broke drunkards between UNLV struggling students. 

However, despite this gritty urban image hidden a couple of blocks from the fabled Strip, this Jack in the Box is Hi-Tech! 

Yup! It has a self-ordering touch screen kiosk at the counter! There are only 3 guys working behind the counter, so why not let the little LCD R2D2 take your order? As it says on it's LCD screen,  it is easier to order than you think!

Just select what type of meal (breakfast, served all day in my case).
Then select from the offerings (there is something new here at Jack's!)
Then select if you want it part of a combo meal (I did!)
Then select what type of drink (OJ for me, got to be healthy!)

The new menu item at Jack's? 

Chorizo Sausage Breakfast Burrito!  
Si senor! 

A breakfast burrito of fluffy scrambed eggs, accented with Chorizo, a spicy sauce and grilled onions! It wasn't half bad! The combo meal with hash browns and OJ totalled $4.49! 

That's less than two full spins of the 1 cent slot machine played 30 ways, at 10 times value! 

And R2D2 got it all right! I didn't have to talk to a gritty human here on the grittier side of town, away from all the lights and neon signs. 

Just LCD Kiosks here. 

And for $4.49 a spin, you come up a winner!
St. Lawrence market is definitely worth a visit if you come to Toronto! There are food vendors of all sorts and you can pick up some fantastic ingredients here. I would've loved to have on extra night in Toronto to cook with some of the scrumptious finds here. I will say, the energy is a little chaotic, in a good way - lots of people walking around and a lot of stuff going on. Left here with some delicious honey ginger mustard.
I went here for a girls night. The restaurant had a nice ambience and our server was pleasent.  We ordered 3 apps and our mains. 

I got the Royal pad thai, it was ok but my friend coconut seafood curry served in a coconut was AMAZING

3 apps, shared bottle of wine,shared dessert  main dishes with tip came out to $54 a person (3 of us)which is kinda steep as I've been  to other places  and had more.  Wish they had more food options on the menu.

BuT i would go back again.
So glad to find a Japanese restaurant open late! My friends and I made a day visit to Toronto and were super hungry before getting drinks at Woodys. Ordered a sushi combo #1 and agedashi tofu. The sashimi cuts were so good, fresh taste, fatty when bitten into without that tendon-like texture. Agedashi tofu was freshly fried too, without the watery microwaved texture you get at other places. Service was fast, friendly and watered refilled. Prices were very reasonable. Best of all, it's good Japanese food for late dinner at 1030pm!
The food is always decent when we come, except the last visit we had; the fish wasn't that fresh. And I like to feel like I know what I'm talking about when it comes to fish since I work in a Japanese restaurant that sells sushi as well. I would give a four for food, but they lose a point for service. It's never really busy when we visit, but severs seem to be confused and dazed. They never really know what's going on. Other than that it's a decent ayce right down the street
So, so delicious. We got brisket biscuits, mac n' cheese, chicken n' waffles n' watermelon, blackberry lemonade and some old fashioneds. If we had had room, we may have gotten the peach cobbler, too, which our table mates got and it also looked incredible.
Came out and repaired a kitchen sink disposal. He did not have one with him and he ran out and picked one up.  He was back in about 20 minutes, safe in assuming he ran to a Home Depot or Lowe's for a new one. Total $387. I asked and called a few times for a receipt for it, since I'm sure they disposal unit itself has a warranty or some kind- told me they would send it. Just kept sending a copy of the bill. That I had already, when I paid it in full at the end of the service.
The first time I walked through the Palms I was not impressed.  A few weeks ago I stayed there for two nights.  I got an amazing rate of $59 a night.  The room was nicely sized and had a good view of the strip.  The room was nicely appointed.  There are some good food options and several club options so you will never be bored.  Staying off the strip can be a hassle, but with a competitive rate it is well worth the hassle.
Jack was extremely helpful and didn't make me feel like I was stupid.  Most mechanics make women feel real dumb but not Jack, he explained everything to me in detail so that I can make an intelligent decision.
Before my husband and I ate here, we went to a place across the street first. We were seated, given menus and water. We were then ignored for 20 minutes so we walked out and came here. I am SO glad we did! Everything about this place is great! Atmosphere, staff, food, entertainment, presentation were fantastic. Our server, Sam, was great. Very informative and friendly. He asked me how spicy I wanted my food on a scale of 1-10 and I'm glad I said 3. It was the perfect spice that it wasn't so overpowering that I couldn't taste all the other flavors. Neither of us had an empty glass on the table, and my husband had at least 4 refills. He never had to ask for one. We are definitely going back and recommending them to everyone we know.
Gorging on raw and cooked fish, tempura, udon, rice and an wide assortment of other Japanese foods is something I try to do less often nowadays than I did 5-10 years ago, but something I enjoy nonetheless. 

As far as AYCE sushi spots go in Markham, this is one of the better ones because of the large variety of dishes. Quality is at or above par as other AYCE sushi establishments.  Sushi on 7 (across the street) is pretty good as well, but seating is limited there so you'll have an easier time finding a table at Yang's on a weekend.

What sets Yang's apart is that Yang's has a greater number and variety of dishes at Yang's than other AYCE sushi places, including a about 12-16 items from the grill such as salmon belly, salmon head, mackerel, sole filets and have some items such as salmon tataki, beef tataki and eel pancake that other AYCE sushi places don't have.  

The sushi is good, I've only had one or two experiences in the many times I've gone here where the sushi was still really cold.  Considering how busy they are they get food out to you quickly.  Do be warned that they seem to run out of some items later at night, this past weekend they were out of seaweed salad and steamed egg. 

They have an assortment of ramen, udon and fried rices as well. 

Desserts are your typical AYCE fare of ice cream and fried banana (which aren't very good, but there aren't many AYCE places with good friend banana anyway). 

It's about $29 (tip and tax included) for dinner on a weekend, and I think about $26 on a weekday.

My favorite AYCE sushi shop is still Prince sushi in Mississauga, but this Yang's a good choice if you're in the north east end of the GTA.
One of my complaints about the Oakville\/Mississauga border is that there's no places to get work done. 

I want some place relatively quiet (I can put on headphones), not too busy or too many distractions (hate when the guy or gal sitting 2 feet away from you just can't stay still) , open until a half decent time (at least 9 pm), has power plugs, serves coffee and a decent snack. 

Starbucks you say? The one @ southdown is too small with people constantly coming and going (and it's dang cold in the winter there). The one @ South Common suffers similar problems. The one @ Dundas and Erin Mills is way too busy. 

Second cup? N\/A

iCoffee (a nice little find I made in Clarkson) - great, but open til 5pm.

Enter Artisano.  

1) It's a bakery\/cafe, so you get good food (priced around $10), half decent coffee ($2), and a variety of baked snacks ($2-5).  

2) It's big, so you can find your own little corner. Also big enough that you're not distracted by hustle and bustle (population density).

3) It's quiet, at least, quiet enough when you throw on a pair of headphones.

4) And there are plugs!

5) It's open til 9-9:30pm daily. 

So, this makes it the holy pentinity (if that's a word, spell check tells me it's not) for a place to get work done! Hazaa!

P.S. The food as actually pretty good. Breads were good, half chicken salad was good, and the half turkey brie panini was also good (Erin, I"d give it another shot - not far off from Panera imho)
I had a mid century modern sectional I was having reupholstered. When it was finished and they delivered it the couch was redesigned and didn't even look like a mid century modern piece of furniture anymore. There were pieces missing that were part of the original furniture. I sent it back and they reupholstered it again, thankfully I had enough fabric. After I got the couch back a second time it started splitting at the seams and corners. I went back again and they said the fabric was inferior and it should have a backing. I ordered the fabric backed and the manufacturer didn't put the backing on. Mendoza knew the fabric was inferior prior to doing the work and nobody brought it to my attention. I have $3,000 in the couch between labor, fabric, and shipping and it's falling apart.
Pretty good and super sweet older man as our server. He really went out of his way to check with the kitchen to accommodate me in my requests in changing some things on a dish that I ordered. We loved the sopapillas for dessert too ;) the only thing weird I noticed was the radio was breaking up and going fuzzy which was semi annoying.
Outback is one of those places that we go when we don't want to be adventurous. No matter which Outback Steakhouse you visit, you know what you are going to get. Will it knock your socks off? Nah. Is it Michelin Star worthy? Nope. Will they bring you that yummy bread? You betcha. My suggestions... Ask for honey butter with the bread and order the coconut shrimp.

Pro tip: Make sure you use call-ahead\/online system to save yourself some wait time
Bonus pro tip: Open seating in the bar area!
Biblos, as Ian A so rightly points out, is the kind of place you walk past a bajillion times before you actually realise you should probably check it out. I walked past it on a twice daily basis for the best part of a year (I was going somewhere, I should add - I wasn't just walking past to gaze in longingly) and now, long after I stopped walking past it, the opportunity arose as we hunted a post-show drink. Watching ice-dancing is enthralling but also you leave the performance feeling like you've been holding your breath for two hours straight and now seriously need to relax.

So we sauntered to the nearby Biblos. What to say, what to say. There was a sign on the wall saying that the upstairs space was reserved, but on asking it apparently wasn't, so we went up. It has a nice interior and I was very comfortable, and I even actually took my actual coat off. Yes, the Lizard Woman was warm enough!

But on the down side, it took a long time for anyone to come and take our order (oh he came around to gather up and whisk away the food menus, and when we said "we would like to order some drinks" he just waved the menus at us as though to say "Not my division. I'm on gathering duty right now."

When we did order, it took a fair while to come. Now then, there were really not that many of us - seven if I recall correctly - and most of the upstairs was empty, so why it should take so long to concoct our round (which included a lime and soda and a diet Coke; not the most challenging) is a mystery. The arrival itself was also slightly confused and flustered.

Nevertheless, it's well located and comfortable, so it's far from being a write off. Ditch the TV (look, I love the IT Crowd, but seriously, what is the point of showing a sitcom with no sound? Football, yes, snooker, fine, but something that relies on dialogue?), whip up the service a bit, and they could have a real winner here. I worry that the good location excuses a little laziness; not for me it doesn't.
Maple Bacon Milkshake: Nice and salty with bits of crunchy bacon and pecan in every creamy sip.  While the presentation may not be as fancy as Zinburger, the styrofoam cup is convenient to take with you, and keeps the shake nice and cold.  I was very happy that it was not so thick that I needed a spoon, and that it stayed chilled throughout my meal 

Brûlée Burger: The burnt sugar crusted bun was amazing.  The bacon and egg were perfectly cooked, and the meat was a nice juicy medium-well bordering on well-done.  I'm usually not a dressing fan but I didn't mind it.  I'll do admit I will probably ask for no lettuce and dressing next time to perfect a carnivore masterpiece.  Like the shake, the texture of the burger was excellent, so whoever is the chef has a great grasp on putting together solid recipes with a good "mouth feel."

The customer service was fantastic.  The guy manning the register was very friendly, and another young male employee checked up on me and offered to take my empty burger basket and trash away.  He was also very quick to clear off and wipe down tables once people had left.

Atmosphere-wise, it's very well put together for a small restaurant, and while crowded, I didn't feel claustrophobic.  I also was very happy they keep their music at a very decent level.  The name-calling for orders wasn't that distracting.

There was also plentiful parking on a Saturday afternoon!  I'll be back.
This review will be shorter than my first two. I came here in May. I came here at 11:30am and beat the lunch rush, which at the time became a line out the door.

Food was delicious. Decor is amazing. Drinks are good. My one issue with this place is that they rush rush rush you out the door. I was doing a business meeting lunch so I didn't appreciate this. 

Normally I value service, comfort higher and being rushed would have resulted in a 1.5 to 2 star loss, but the food was delicious so I can't be too harsh.
Came for the Islamic noodles. The coconut milk base was amazing. Also tried their orange chicken. It was plated in a way that made it look small, but it was surprisingly filling. Not really digging the shared seatings but chances are you'll get it if you're a small party. 

 Unbeatable price for students craving Thai cuisine.
By far, the coolest, most unique bar I've ever experienced! UnderTow literally sits in a small room underneath Sip Beer and Coffee. It appears both Sip and UnderTow are in a converted oil change shop. The old shop's garage doors are used to allow open air seating upstairs in Sip. From the street you cannot see UnderTow and you must literally walk through Sip, head down the narrow staircase to reach this hidden gem of a bar. It's ingenious they decided to convert the underground area where oil change workers access the undercarriage of your car, into this crazy, creative scene from an old pirate's ship. 

From previous reviews I knew this place was small and only seats about 20 people. Yet I was still shocked upon walking downstairs just how small and intimate the place really was. Reservations can only be made online up until 4pm the day-of but walk-ins are accepted on a first-come first-serve basis. We couldn't get a reservation online as they were already fully booked but we decided to take a shot and show up around 10:30pm on a Saturday. They were actually able to seat the two of us right away. I would caution folks with larger parties that the wait could be longer due to the limited space. 

Drinks were out of this world and my "Mock-tail" was handcrafted by the bartender to make me feel special so I had a tropical drink too. My husband loved his fruity drink, said it was outstanding, and would get it again. 

If you're looking for a unique, intimate experience and you're intrigued by pirates ships, this is your spot!
This is one of my favorite places to eat in mt Lebanon. It is always super clean, and the staff are friendly and accommodating. On two occasions I have been there and the owner has been semi rude (ignoring customers and not interacting with them even when talked to). They have the best chicken kebabs I've ever had. The dip trio is amazing. They have a small outdoor table that I enjoy eating at when the weather cooperates. This restaurant is located right next to the uptown parking garage. This restaurant is byob. They have a hot food buffet on the weekend, which I have never tried, but would like to!
Just went there once, but the food was great.  I had pulled pork on a baked potato, and it was tender and moist with lots of flavor.  Because I'm gluten and casein free, sometimes it's hard to find things to eat, but the waitress was super friendly and checked on ingredients happily for me from the kitchen staff.  Peach sangria was heavenly.  Definitely am going back.  Pretty good for a chain.
After a couple of years hiatus I decided to give Fresh another try.  I have never loved their treatment of food - I find it bland.  I wasn't disappointed - or rather I wasn't surprised.  It was pretty awful.  Terrible service.  A modest amount of veggies on a HUGE clump of soggy, cool, sticky  (bad) soba - way too much to stuff down.  My cat could cook better.  Couldn't get the waiter's attention though she had maybe 5 minutes to chat with a table nearby.  Give it a pass.  Maybe they'll wake up.  They need to respect the diners.  Oh yeah.  They charge a lot for such pathetic offerings.
Really cool stadium once you're inside but it takes some work to get there. Unless you have a color-coded parking pass, you're expected to park and walk from Westgate, about 15 minutes from the stadium. No big deal but just good to know in advance. Security is a real hassle. I purposefully changed into a much smaller handbag before we headed out to Glendale. It's wallet sized at most, room only enough for ID, debit card, phone, etc. It didn't pass the guidelines and wasn't allowed in. So because we had park so far away, it took a good 45 minutes to put my bag back in the car, get back to the stadium, and go through security again. 

Food options inside were pretty meek but it's a sports arena. Hard to expect much more than hot dogs and pretzels. Awesome place to watch a game. Rise up, Red Sea!
All you can eat sushi was something I had to try, especially since the reviews were pretty good. Unfortunately this isn't a place I have to come back to. 

Quality of food wasn't great but you definitely get a lot for your money. I didn't realize that appetizers, soup, salads (several different options), and dessert are also included in the $21\/person fixed price, so that was a nice bonus. That being said, nothing was super flavorful or fresh tasting. 

Family friendly environment and we were 1 of 3 families eating on a Friday night with kids. Server was attentive and nice. Downfall was the food wasn't amazing, it was just ok.
So until today I didn't know there was a lot of hype about this place.  Ashley L. suggested it and I said sure why not.  While waiting for her in the parking lot, doors locked and windows up, I decided to look at it on Yelp.  Wow was there a lot of reviews.  
So we got there early and there was no wait.  I guess that is rare.  We both got The Hog and Chick with bacon and sourdough bread she got eggs over hard and I got them scrambled and we shared a stack of pancakes.  I have to admit that the food was really good.  I am not saying this because others have said it but because it is my own opinion.  Like I said I didn't even know it existed until she suggested it.  The service was great and we had a great experience. 
My only problem is the size.  It is tiny.  Wow.  There is a place on the west side known as The Place and it used to be in a small location and moved to a larger one.  Much easier to get in and the food is still great.  They may stay there because it feels quaint but that I think was the only flaw I saw.
I went here today for lunch for my first time with a friend and being a vegetarian enthusiast I was very disappointed . Getting to this place was a huge hassle but what's worst was the service .. I ordered a Philly cheese steak sandwich with mushrooms and onions with a fry . When the food arrived I had my sandwich without the mushrooms or veganaise as I requested when I went in to
The store I informed a person that did not take my order of the mishap
She rudely stated we charge extra for what was missing on my sandwich but the person that originally took my order admitted to the mistake the lady was so rude and unfriendly that I didn't even want the meal she killed my appetite and I returned the food the lady gave me a refund and coldly told the nice person that originally had taken my order to throw my food away. So basically they lost what would have been a loyal
Customer over rude service and refunded 10  bucks instead of correcting a mistake that cost 1.00 I hope the owner of this place discusses the importance of customer service with the rude lady that spoke with me if they don't they won't be in business long not to mention the location is hard to find all I can say is best of luck to this business I spent my money elsewhere..
So satisfied with our meal this evening. Pitmaster board, salmon and chicken\/ribs, mac and cheese and bacon sprouts. All amazing. The staff were pleasant and helpful, most accommodating. Will be going again, no doubt.
*This review only reflects the brunch service. 
*For their brunch, I really appreciated how Maman don't have the typical egg benedict that you would see on every brunch's menu in Toronto.
*You can make a reservation for their weekend brunch through email. 
*The staff are true Parisian, no Quebecois french (for those who cares....) 
*The service was amazing and tentative. 
*Quite and relaxing ambiance. 

-Matcha Latte - $5: 
The drink quality here are always consistent! Instead of normal milk, Maman servers the matcha latte with almond milk. I liked how the latte wasn't too sweet and you can taste the strong (almost grassy) taste of matcha, which is how I like it :).

-Smoke Salmon served on blinies bread with yogurt sauce, lemon, dill & espelette pepper - $15: 
Friend loved it and licked the plate clean. 

-Croque "maman" with parisian ham, comté cheese and béchamel sauce (optional with a sunny side-up egg +$2) - $15: 
The croque madame, or "maman" came out piping hot and it was a huge portion! Without the egg, the sandwich would still have been really filling and it was worth the $13 price tag. The side salad had a bit too much dressings, but it was refreshing after having a heavy sandwich.

Oh boy, I normally dislike the béchamel sauce as some tends to taste a bit too flour-y or bland, but this was incredibly flavorful and the sauce was not too thin nor thick. The cheese just slightly melted, creamy and buttery. Break the egg yolk and it will runs through your sandwich and mixes with the cheese and béchamel sauce, and it turns into this eating experience that is just beyond words. 

-Matcha green tea pancakes with blueberries, ricotta & shredded coconut - $14: 
The matcha flavor didn't come through and it was almost undetectable.I couldn't taste the ricotta nor shredded coconut either. The texture of the pancake was too doughy, dense and almost rubbery. I thought the portion was quite small for $14, but it was a good sized portion without making you feeling stuffed. The one positive thing I can think of was that the pancake was not too sweet, even with the syrup and whipped cream.
Meh is about all I can say about Cabo. I feel like it is super over-hyped... We went in for dinner on a Tuesday night around 7pm. It was pretty crowded but there was no wait. They brought over chips & salsa. The chips were warm but I didn't get the feeling that they were made fresh. They were on the thicker side. The salsa was a mix of corn and tomatoes\/peppers (pico de gallo). Not spicy and not really salsa, but ok. We each ordered our own combo taco plate ($10.50) which came with two tacos and a side. I got one BBQ Mahi taco and one Tavaruva Wahoo taco with fruit as my side (seasonal). I was incredibly underwhelmed with my food. The fish in both were way overcooked and dry. The wahoo taco was way salty and the mahi was under seasoned... Another thing that annoyed me, they only have flour tortillas... Really? A fish taco place with only flour tortillas... Even worse, they weren't homemade\/fresh. They had that store bought flour tortilla smell. Come on guys... Step it up.
Stars: Proper ramen noodles!  Medium (between soft and hard) boiled eggs, so there's a runny yolk!  So they at least get two for those.  The shrimp tempura was very light and not very "fishy" tasting or smelling, though the shrimp were very skinny.  When there was interaction, the wait staff was knowledgable and polite.  Water was refilled at several intervals (though my tiny little water cup was often dry).

Star subtraction: The broth was lacking in depth and complexity...it didn't have any pronounced pork\/bonito\/shoyu flavor, leaving me wondering if it was supposed to be a miso broth.  The tonkatsu was very dry (needed a broth dunking and I used the leftover shrimp tempura sauce).  The large, empty save the sauce dipping bowls, appetizer plate was never cleared from the small table.  The wait staff seemed to vanish for very long periods of time.  I was not a fan of the (hugely overpriced) caramel soft serve dessert.
No charm. At least go to NY NY and have a beer at their sports bar. 

Some of the worst future odds in town. I could not believe that the Wynn was substantially better (6-1 versus 10-1) 

They just have basic future bets so I went to Wynn to get my Dancing with the Stars bet in. Go CB.
Ouii, ce n'est pas cher et ça se fait vite quand c'est notre tour...mais question service, hygiène  ouf c'est autre chose. Je m'explique...

Tu arrives là et tu dois prendre un numéro devant un monsieur du style PIMP à épileuse de sourcila comme à l'épicerie pour commander ton balloné ou ta viande. Bon et la tu attends... Qu'on t'appelle par ton numéro..
.et la on tu t'assis sur un banc ou pleins de filles on déposé leur tête propre et salle.... Et les madames qui font les sourcils n'ont pas d'l'air à se laver les mains ben ben.... Bref ça c'est la section sourcil...

J'ai essayé l'épilation parce que je suis cheap...Okey ce n'est pas cher mais bon..
Pas d'hygiene et salle encore une fois...la repousse des poils sort toute croche. J'ai eu des poils incarnés (pas seulement moi, des amis qui ont été aussi
..) et tse les petits poils qui restent, que normalement les esthéticiennes enlèvent à la pince? Ben eux ils ne font rien de ça si ça ne part pas too bad...

Bref, oui c'est cheap and faboulous, mais pour moi il manque de l'hygiène et un meilleur service à la clientèle...mais bon quand on est pauvre pas le choiz d'y aller de temps en temps...
The food is definitely good and authentic. This is the only Asian restaurant in Madison that I know of that serves stir fry on choy vegetables, which is a must. I use to always have to drive to Chicago to get a plate, now I can get an order in Madison. The noodle dishes are good also, you get a decent amount of meat and vegetables. The service is a bit slow, however that is expected from a small Asian restaurant. Overall decent spot and prices are reasonable.
This year instead of running the half, I rode my bike in their 20 mi bike tour- what a great way to spend the morning!  The ride was mostly flat, extremely well organized and enjoyable. In addition to the bike tour, half, and full, they've added a mini marathon which is 5.4 miles. 
I was ohhhh, so impressed by their logistics of getting everyone in and out. Have to confirm but I would say there were easily 10,000 that day. 
Pretty soon, this event is going to turn into the PF Chang Rock n Roll NATION!
I have to agree with the previous review (1\/23\/2017).  We also booked during Restaurant Week and felt the experience was top shelf from beginning to end:
1. We loved the menu appearing on the Restaurant Week website.  So many interesting entres to choose from that were far different than almost any other restaurant participating.  We have visited Tempest twice before with excellent outcomes, so we booked.
2.  The food was amazing.  My partner had the fried oysters w\/seaweed slaw.  Spectacular, especially the slaw.  I had the lobster bisque w\/flying fish roe.  Similarly tasty.
3. The entres came and were greatly satisfying.  The Marlin had a nice lime aioli.  The pasta had a large portion of different shellfish that were quite delicious.  
4.  Great selections from the desserts offered this week.  It was really hard to choose, and when ours arrived, they were great!
5.  The only glitch was there was no decaf. to order with dessert, but we had enough wine & water to be satisfied.
6.  The serving staff & the hosts were beyond professional.  This group worked together like a well-oiled machine.  Or maybe a well-tuned instrument.  

A huge thanks to everyone who made this experience a bright spot in the middle of an otherwise dreary week in winter.  WE WILL RETURN!
*Crave Healthy Habits is a chain that aims to serve healthy food choices that are both nutritious and tasty, yet at affordable prices.

*I can't speak for their salad, but the breakfast boxes are affordable, delicious and very nutritious! 

*Despite locating in a food court, Crave is spacious and very modern looking, which is completely different than other stores in the same food court.

* Because of the open kitchen concept, you can see all the fruits are freshly prepared right in front of your eyes. Occasionally Crave will run out of certain fruit, and the staff have always happily given me more of any fruit that I want, such as strawberry!

*Do note that Crave only sell their breakfast boxes from 7AM to 11AM with the exception to the yogurt parfait, and all other items on the menu is for lunch from 11AM to closing.

-Time Oat -$5: 
 I have always asked to substitute pecans with almonds on all my orders, and I'm sure the staff have known me by now because of this lol. The rolled oats were soft and warm, not too mushy or gluey. I found the texture of the strawberry avocado puree is more of a syrup, which is actually even better as I felt a creamier puree might be too heavy and filling for this. Although it was quite bland on its own, but mix it well and the natural sweetness from the fruits and the sweet puree really boost up the flavor of the rolled oats.

-Morning Run - $5: 
Another really heathy and high protein choice! Again, loved the natural sweetness from the fruits and I like how there was just a touch of maple syrup, so the entire dish isn't too sweet. I believe the yogurt is sugar-free as well and it was just a bit tangy. The lemon curd was such a nice surprise addition and it really gave a nice zing to wake you up in the morning! However I prefer the Time oat than morning run as I found Time Oat to be more filling yet not too heavy in the tummy :).

-Yogurt Parfait - $4: 
For $4 the portion was huge and it's actually even cheaper than the ones at Tim Hortons or Starbucks! I believe the parfait at those two shops cost around $3-4 and they aren't exactly healthy lol... Note that the yogurt parfait is available throughout the day so if you are looking for a mid-day snack that is similar to the morning run, get this!

-Santorini - $5: 
Other than yogurt or rolled oats, Crave also offer toasts for breakfast as well. I actually only got this once and I'm not sure if $5 for this is justifiable. I guess it could be, but the portion was a bit smaller and I felt I can get something bigger like the rolled oats for the same price? Don't get me wrong though, this was absolutely delicious!  The fresh pomegranate seeds gave a slight crunch with every bite and really cut down the creaminess of the avocado. The puree was creamy and fresh, along with the distinctive sour flavor of the bread and drizzled with just right amount of olive oil, it was quite filling and satisfying!
I visited Juniper on one of those beautiful Autumn afternoons. 

When you first walk in there are tables and chairs in a light and airy area. But the real delights await further down the bar area where it opens up to a beautifully designed sitting area. There are very comfortable sofa's laid out nicely in groups of two for those quiet meetings or imbibing one of their signature cocktails.

There are a couple of larger sofa areas for bigger groups. The service was brilliant, attentive and personal. We started with a prosecco as how else do you celebrate a new find like Juniper? We then moved onto the apple martinis. These were delicious and would highly recommend them. They were the colour of real apple juice, just how they should be (unlike some that are a fluro green!). And very quaffable indeed! 

I'd highly recommend this as a great new place to try, it's a good place to meet friends or for a date. They have wifi there and have been told their coffee is good so I'd also recommend it as a great place to work or catch up on surfing :-)
I am reviewing the sub side as I have never tried the Smoothie King's offerings but I can say that their counter is always busy.  

The subs here are offered in various sizes on fresh bread and made to order in front of you.  One complaint I have is they smash the living daylights out of your sub when they cut it.  The meats are sliced as you order and the veggies are pretty fresh.

The indoor seating here is very limited but they have a decent size outdoor patio which is really useless 4 months out of the year.  The parking is pretty tight and gets pretty hectic at lunch time.
I keep coming back here for their Wintermelon milk tea! It's just the bomb. You can either order it hot or cold. WIth the weather recently, a hot milk tea was just a perfect way to end the day.

I always order my tea with 25% sugar level but it always turns out to be really sweet (I can only imagine the 100%). I might try ordering with 0% next time and see how that turns out.  

The food here is pretty okay. I cannot totally speak for it altogether. I have not tried enough of their "fusion" food to judge it. We always ordered take out too. Even though, I believe that the quality of food should not suffer whether it be dine in or take outs - sometimes it just can't be helped. I will try eating there when I find the time.

I do love their Pork Belly Moco. It's very unique and very tasty. A little fatty but I sure that's what makes the dish taste that good. The chicken katsu is good too and so is their Pork Lau Lau and Kahlua Pork. I love Hawaiian food so I can be pretty bias. 

I will definitely be back.
I'm a big burger fan and I wanted to check this place out since it open on Yonge Street. First Impressions the guy that served us was really pleasant and friendly, he recommended the signature burger , we both got one and since I was really hungry I also got the Big Chuck, we also got onion rings and fries. We got them to go. $52.00 .Unfortunately I was not Impressed, the patty had a filler which was easily detected, I have been to many Burger joints ,and you can tell when there is no filler in a burger patty, we both agreed that  the signatures were disappointing, The Big Chuck, which is their take in a Big Mac, I think I would have preferred the Big Mac, did not like their take on the sauce, fries where ehh...... I think the only thing we both enjoyed were the onion rings. When you spend $52.00 on burgers I was hoping to get a good burger at the very least. First and Last time I visit Holy Chucks, they say " you get what you paid for" In this case I got ripped off. Would not recommend.
Just to be cleared. I'm only basing my rating on 2 dishes because they're good at it. This place make one of my favorite butter chicken  and pretty Dezzzz vegetarian samosa. Legit, authentic Indian food feel. Their portion is small, but dinner for 2 I do recommend it with 2 serving of different roti, is satisfying enough. If you are a bigger guy. This might not be enough. (So be aware)

I can't suggest the other dishes thou I have tried it. It aren't the best. But I want others to know what they do well on since they do deserve it.
Since moving to Arizona, I have found it difficult to find "mom and pop" shops in the East Valley. Imagine my delight when a coworker directed me to The Bread Basket. This is a quaint, privately owned bakery that has excellent customer service and delivers a fantastic product. My husband and I chose this bakery to make our wedding cake and we were not disappointed. We ordered a three tier square cake. It was a marble cake with fresh raspberry filling...no fruit preserves allowed. It was delicious and beautiful, exactly what we had wanted. One of the owners, Brenda, delivered the cake to our venue herself. Since then, we order a miniature version of our cake on every anniversary and continue to enjoy the baking bonanza at The Bread Basket.
You owe it to yourself to give this AYCE sushi joint a try. It has the most generous pieces of fish that I have encountered. Best fish to rice ratio for nigiri by far. Super friendly service, fresh fish and lower price. Ambience could use some help but the AYCE is a great deal.
So I'm unsure what happen before with this shop but I just had a great experience!

I went in on a hope they could fix my garmin cycling device. After going to hardwares and a few other places with no luck I tried iphone doctor. Without a hesitation the gentleman check out my device and was able to fix it pretty fast and without complaint.

I realize I didn't bring my phone or was purchasing a phone but the customer service was exceptional. While waiting I actually did enquirer about phones and they were very helpful.. I think maybe a turn over in staff has helped this iphone doctor 100%
So fresh and tasty!  What a nice surprise!  Totally exceeded my expectations.  Used to come by here occasionally for gorditas but noticed the sign changed and really didn't consider trying the new place. What a mistake!  It's now table service with some really unique items, check out the menu.  The fish tacos are not your average fish tacos. They had black beans, rice, avocado and a yummy sauce!  Shrimp on the tostada tasted so clean and fresh not like other shrimp commonly found around town and piled high!  And they have the gorditas on the menu still!  The lunch special was two tacos of your choice and included an agua fresca for $4.99!  Amazing for the quality!  Make it a point to try this place if your in the area.  No beer or wine yet but the staff assured me that is only temporary and they are just waiting to get the official sign off on the liquor license, any day now.  Can't wait to take some friends to this new find in that area.
These guys were great! Easy to make an appointment, and they took care of my brakes and oil change in a very timely manner. The cost was extremely fair and they even took me home while they were taking care of my car. Very professional,, I would highly recommend them for any of your automotive needs.. Thank you Jim and Brandon!
I am from out of town and wanted to try something new! Yelp brought me to this gem. Service was fantastic. Food was perfect. I definitely recommend this place.
My party of five went here on Saturday afternoon. It was a sports Grill atmosphere with TVs playing sports and loud conversations all around me. Thankfully, we broke the monotony and were loudest of all.  We had a great time. Our waitress was very patient with us as we sampled many spirits and appetizers. I really enjoyed being here more so than the one over in Santan Village. The artichoke dip is amazing. Also, we ordered medium wings and they tasted fantastic. That may be the spirits talking, but we're definitely coming back either way!
Came here after dinner to meet up with some friends...it was nice and roomy for 7 people. 

We ordered a plate of Rosemary fries to share, which wasn't bad, however when served it was room temperature and did not taste like it just came out of the fryer.

BF had ordered a couple of beers, which he was not impressed at all with.
While on a mini "vaca" I discovered that I rather enjoyed the focus and concentration of pool, having never tried before (there was a table in the lobby of our hotel) afterwards I was determined to find some place where I could hone my new interest and searched some places and found Kirby's!! It was another yelp review that mentioned that kids were allowed until 10pm (as my 13 year old became a fan as well) and we gave Kirby's a try. Our first time in a pool hall and the staff were very accommodating and attentive. We had a fabulous experience learning and even had dinner there, the wings and fries were great! We have set a goal to become regulars
Giving this place one star for carrying daifuku mochi (adzuki bean), albeit the processed, boxed kind.

Other than that, this market was dirty, disorganized, poorly-lit, prices were poorly marked, and it was not customer-friendly in any way.  Zero service.  While the staff at other small specialty Asian markets (not Lee Lee) will ask if you need help, here that didn't happen.  

There was a TINY hand-written note on the cash register stating a $10 minimum for credit card use.  Thank goodness I saw that before I looked dumb trying to use mine for a single box of mochi.

I won't be back.  Lee Lee carries fresh mochi, if you can catch it in stock.  New Tokyo has a better brand of packaged mochi (plus frozen types).  Cost Plus is closer and much more enjoyable to shop at, and their packaged mochi is only a little worse tasting than the brand this market carries.
This Japanese restaurant had been around for a few years. The food is good and always great service. The rolls, sushi, and sashimi are pretty good for their price point. They also have a good selection of Korean dishes since they seem to be Korean owned. Definitely their must orders are their rolls! Lots to choose from!
I was in desparate of a lash extentension fillI think I jus about called every salon in vegas..then I happened to come across Sofia at the Phenix beauty and Salon on Buffalo\/Flamingo..i called her and told her my situation and I neededher services asap..this very sweet woman,made me a special appt. for 2 hours later on the very same day!Her skill is worth a 6 star rating if there was one..she is spot on with her experienced hands and knowledge..If you're thinking about lash extensions ,or just needed a fill like me,then look No further,give Sofia a call..I guarantee,a you will not be disappointed,and will become one of her regular customer,like I am..and thank you Sofia,you did a beautiful job with my lashes!much mahalos to you!Char B.
If you have a hang over and need foood. Breakfast is goood and cheap, $5.99. You can stuff yourself and go back to bed.
Surprised by this place.  I would have never gone there if just driving by.  In an old stripmall in a not so glitzy part of town. I went in because of Yelp.  Glad I did.  Very clean and tasty food.  I guess the chef has worked on the strip in some fancy Japanese places and now has his own little place.  Simple menu and friendly staff.  Quick service and great prices.  Good place to stop if you're in this area.  There really aren't very many good options around it.
Haven't been back to Duckworth's often since my first review, but visited yesterday and saw reason to update my rating.

The beer selection and quality at Duckworth's is top notch.The service is good.

The food, however, is not. Or more fairly, the menu at Duckworth's is hit or miss.

Ordered the St. Louis style ribs yesterday, with cole slaw as a side. The food arrived on an enormous plate.

As I tucked into my food, I could swear I tasted... lighter fluid? I don't know, something "off" about the ribs. They tasted chemical-like, not smoked. 

The cole slaw was warm, and also tasted slightly rancid.

The garlic bread tasted like my dad's version, which is to say it was drowned in garlic salt... Blech.

The tater tots? They were fantastic. But COME ON! They're tater tots!

If you're going to Duckworth's, stick to pure bar fare. Wings, potato skins, etc. Probably your safest bet.
Perfection in a styrofoam cup!

I selected a regular half (blue!) Vanilla, half Wedding Cake shave ice with ice cream, mochi, and a snow cap (condensed milk on top).  It was amazing, and definitely REAL Hawaiian shave ice.

Bonus points for not using those horrible wooden spatula spoons some places use, but having decent plastic ones.

The owners were extremely friendly, and they're "locals" from Hawaii too!  Their ingredients\/syrups all come from Honolulu.  They mentioned that they do private parties, events, and fundraisers too.  I was also offered a sample of any other flavors they had, but I was far too into devouring my creamy vanilla cake concoction to take them up on it today.

I will definitely be back!  Note that they're prices are HALF of Snoh on Camelback's, with the trade off being less atmosphere (it's very plain inside) and less deluxe toppings.  Snoh's flavor-infused ice is also more "sticky" and "fluffy" while K's has a better bite\/chew\/texture to it, and has much more flavor thanks to the generous use of syrup!
was amazingly delicious and i'm not vegan! i just felt so healthy but full eating there!
the place is kooky and casual...
need to go back
This was a great place! Thanks to all you Yelpers for giving it such a good rating. I arranged for a business lunch there and was wonderfully surprised. Great waiter, Brooks, took really good care of my colleague and I and the food was perfectly cooked. We ate outside next to the canal on a Patio that was covered. It was beautiful spring day and I will go back with family and friends anytime.

Cheers and Bon Appetite!
OMG My Friend Brent AKA Stumpy Owns this Place!
A small, clean Indian food joint tucked away in a little corner, Narula's serves up some good Indian cuisine for a reasonable price.  Serving portions aren't large, but Indian food is fairly heavy so it's an adaquate portion. 

The food is prepared when you order, so while you don't get curry that's been sitting on a hotplate for hours on end, it also takes a while for your food to arrive.  So those looking for a quick bite for lunch, be warned! It took about 20 minutes for my butter chicken dish with Naan to arrive. 

The food is flavorful, spiced well, and the Naan was good and not overly oily.  For $7 it's well priced, the only issue is the wait time.
All i have to say i had a blast the food was to die for. I had just found out about this and now im totally hooked yup going back
My boyfriend and I love this place! 

We had Chicha Morada (sweet purple corn drink), papa la huancaina (boiled potatoes covered in creamy and spicy  huancaina sauce) , seco (delicious beef and cilantro stew with rice) and lomo saltado (sauteed strip of sirloin, tomatoes, onions, fries and rice). 

I've grown up eating Peruvian food and think this place serves as a great substitution for the real deal (parents and grandma don't live here!) We usually get good service and the food has been consistently good. Honestly, I'm happy to see the improvements from the new owners and look forward to try the food when the new chef starts... exciting because we've already tried the new chef's food from an over-priced restaurant in San Diego and sad because we'll be going back home soon.

This place is definitely worth a try because you get a great meal at an affordable price.
Is it just me or is there a lack of speciality running stores in the Valley?  Located next to a Landis Cycle store, Sole Sports is a great resource for all things running - from getting a great fit in a new pair of shoes to accessories to offering training runs.  The staff are avid runners and know their stuff, so see them in you're ready to get into running or update your gear.  

They also accept your used running shoes and donate them to a good cause - plus, if your donation you get $5 or $10 dollars off a new shoe purchase!
Good gyros, neat little place, sort of what South Side is all about
BJ's is one of our regular spots.  The craft beers are always good, the food is good, and the service is good as well.  That's what we like about BJ's, it's consistently a good place to grab dinner and you know what to expect.
I love Verdun's brand new doggy cafe! We organized a Frenchie meetup here yesterday night and everything went super smoothly.

First off, the owner and employees are the sweetest. They warmly welcomed our little pack of rambunctious Frenchies and made sure we were comfortable and didn't lack anything. You won't find moody rushed waitresses here. 

The dining room is long and narrow, cool yet cozy. Our puppy crew took over one of their comfy dark leather booths. The gym wasn't ready yet but the staff was nice enough to let our dogs play in the room. Apparently they will transform it into a real gym in the near-future, with a treadmill, hoops and other toys to tire your dog out (which means better sleep for us!). To avoid chaos and respect timid dogs and owners in the dining room, dogs can only roam around freely in the gym. 

I tried the Salty Dog and Bloody Hound cocktails. Love the names, and the taste even more! The drinks were not overly sweet. The muttball open sandwich was tasty and filling. Maybe I would have preferred a regular sub though, as I didn't feel like eating it with a knife and fork. The dogs went nuts over homemade yogurt pups and treats picked off the doggy menu. They even serve dinner if your furry bff doesn't feel like cooking. 

We can't wait to come back for brunch, for a drink or just to hang out!
e is one of the best and most innovative restaurants on the Strip. If fine dining is part of your plan while you're Las Vegas, seriously consider planning ahead to have an awesome meal at this place.

Planning ahead is required, btw. There is no dropping in on the restaurant or phoning in for a reservation - you need to email them directly and hope they have a spot for you. I've been a few times and have never had a problem but just keep in mind that you need to take care of business many weeks\/months before you arrive in Vegas. For your troubles you will receive a Willy Wonka-esque golden Admit One ticket in the mail which is nice little touch.

After pre-dinner drinks in the more casual Andres establishment you will be escorted back to the dining bar. There are only a handful of seats per seating and everyone sits at the bar while food is prepared in front of you. It is easily the most fun chef's table experience I've ever had. The overall irreverent and playful tone of the evening also is a huge plus as you won't have to feel self conscious showing ecstasy with your food like you would a stuffier restaurant

The food is mostly phenomenal with a combination of new dishes and a few e classics. Each time I've been there they've had the foie gras donuts which are one of the more surprising treats you'll ever consume - when you take your first bite you'll be expecting something with the taste and texture of a Hostess chocolate donut but instead you'll be treated to some of the melty-ess, savoriest foie gras ever. As great as those are they in no way compare to the other fun foie gras preparation, the cotton candy empanadas; these fluffy, sugary and ever slightly rich delicacies were among the most amazing things I've ever tasted. The clams I've had here have also been among my favorite bites ever, with a slightly vinegary brine that is so much more delicious than I'm making it sound.

What's not to love? I do have to say that each time I've been here they've made quite a spectacle of the wagyu beef course (bringing the giant cuts out for display beforehand) but it's always been a cut below just about every wagyu steak I can remember in my head. There are also occasional dishes that don't work as well as the true standouts - in particular I was not a huge fan of the whole baby octopus!

This said, those are relatively minor complaints on an otherwise spectacular experience. Definitely spend an evening at e if you can hook up a reservation and afford the price tag!
My favorite smoothie place and this one is no exception!  Friendly, prompt service; even when lines are long I haven't waited long, which is important when you're trying to catch your next flight.

Their smoothies are smooth and creamy.  I feel like you get more fruit flavor in their drinks rather than syrupy sweetness like other places and they're not as much like a slushy that other places might try to call a smoothie.

Jamba Juice set the bar for me as to what a smoothie should be!
I am extremely pleased with my experience with Bite. Service was excellent and food was so delicious!

Their pancakes are amazingly fluffy and not dense at all. I usually judge a breakfast place based on how they make their pancakes. Because seriously, if you can't make good pancakes, why even call yourself a breakfast brunch place. 

The flavors of everything we ordered were spot on! It was so good. I will definitely come back to try their other pancakes.  

I think I may have found the new love of my life!
No secret that my husband and I love burritos, it's a kind of addiction. I have my favourites (Chorizo in the burbs, and Bandidos downtown) but lately I've been all about the burrito bowl from Chipotle. 

Most burrito joints I go for bean and cheese, with all of the fillings I tend to find the meat takes over (plus I'm getting some protein in the beans), but Chipotle's steak has really impressed me. It's always perfectly cooked with some pink on the inside! The reason I go for the bowl here is that they don't grill the burritos so I find the tortilla a bit too chewy and unnecessary on the calorie front. The bowl comes with rice (white or brown - I usually go for white), beans (black for me), salsa (the spicy red tomatillo is truly fantastic, hot but super flavourful as well), and then lettuce, cheese, sour cream, and I pay the RIDICULOUS 2.25 for guacamole too. To me guac is a necessary burrito topping and should be included everywhere.

Anyways this is a super filling meal but incredibly tasty. You can split it over two meals for sure and at least you rest easy knowing the ingredients are fresh and the meat is local. 

I'm a regular at the Front St. location but I have to say the Yonge location, albeit way busier, has better service. 

Final thought: my husband has the app and it's really handy to pre-order if you're going during a busy time! You can head right to the cash to grab and go.
I've been here many times. Primarily because it's the closest bar to where I live.

If you're a member of the younger crowd 21-35 you'll probably love this place. If you're looking for a quite place to get away and have a drink this is not the place.

Friday and Saturday nights, as well as many evenings, the place is so packed it's hard to find a spot at the bar.

You'll find a lot of kids yelling and screaming acting as if it's the first time they've ever had a drink.

As for there food I've tried most everything on the menu and every time it's been a disappointment.

The staff is usually very friendly and attentive.

So although I go here on a regular basis I wouldn't give it high marks. But like I said if you're younger and want to hang out with a louder crowd you'll probably enjoy this place.
The Steak Escape gives me great food, prepared in front of me with fresh ingredients at a great price. 

I don't go to the mall often, but when I do, my wife and I will stop here for a steak sandwich.  I ordered the Bacon and Bourbon with jalapeños and my wife ordered the classic with jalapeños. We couldn't finish the large size and took it home.  It teased our senses then delivered with fantastic flavor and texture. 
I watched several orders be prepared with fresh, crisp veggies. The meats were chilled not frozen. 
I love coming here because I can see them prep what I will be eating. I will be back soon!
Delicious food and really pleasant\/helpful staff. I am half Greek so my stadards for Greek food are pretty high. I ordered the meatball appetizer (Keftedes) and a side of veggies. I ordered my food to go but shortly after leaving I realized the meatballs were not how my grandmother makes them (in red sauce) so I went back in to ask for sauce. They only had pizza sauce but it was actually really delcious. Makes me want to go back and eat their pizza. Probably seemed like a strange request but the staff was really nice about it and gave me a generous portion which made a world of difference with the meatballs. Really enjoyed them. Very flavorful and juicy. The veggies were really good too (added some sauce on them as well.) I work close by and with not many options in the area its nice to have a place to get good quality food at a decent price. A little over $10 for both things.
This was my first visit to Ballantyne Barbershop (BB) but not my first HC with Dusty B. I was quite disappointed when I heard that Dusty was leaving the B@B as it was close to home, making it convenient and had a trusted barber. 

I was pleasantly surprised with his new location at BB! A larger shop in a smaller shopping center with plenty of parking and none of the congestion of his last location.  The shop is bright, fresh, has great flat screens strategically placed and plenty of seating. You can book your appointment from your smart device. And there are none of the irritating "ringing phones" of Dusty's last location.

Just friendly barbers, pleasant conversation and......Dusty to give me a trim!
And only a couple of miles from the other place so give Dusty and the Ballantyne Barbershop a try!
We visited in early July '15 and my husband STILL talks about this place!

The chef tasting menu with wine pairings is what we both opted for and look back with NO regrets.  Hubs says this is his favorite beef filet ever and if we ever go back to Vegas he doesn't know if he could do another steak place!!!

Not sure if the chef tasting menu changes, but our waiter gave us great wine pairing recommendations.  If you have the banana cream pie, I WOULD opt for the extra cost wine pairing for that one!  If you have the carrot cake, it so sweet it doesn't need the dessert wine!!  Our waiter recommended accordingly, but the hubs an i were sharing the desserts so we got to test this out!!  :)
My husband and I were really, really disappointed with our experience at Coulter Infiniti.  We brought our 2006 G37 with barely 34,000 miles (and out of warranty) to have the moon roof looked at.  The moon roof wouldn't open or close, but you could hear the motor working.

After leaving the car there all day we get a call that the car needs a whole new moon roof track - which would cost over $3000.  We contacted their corporate office to attempt to get some or all of the cost covered, due to the fact that it's a big repair and the car  is barely out of warranty.  We were flat out denied.  Twice.  

We were dreading the big repair, and decided to bring the car to a different auto shop (which will get a big, fat 5 star review) for a second opinion.  Turns out the track just had a BUILD UP OF DIRT AND DEBRIS and needed to be cleaned out.  Seriously?!?!  Just over $100 later we were on our way!

I find it VERY hard to believe that Coulter didn't know this was the problem.  We are now searching for a new SUV, and will not be choosing Infiniti.  How disappointing.
This ploce is terrible. horrible customer service. On Thursday, November 20th, I called MULTIPLE times about pictures that I ordered online. First, the girl with the attitude that I spoke to on the phone told me I might have to have them printed somewhere else because the order two people in front of me ordered at 8x10 and they ran out of 8x10 ribbon. I ordered a 5x7 and (2) 4x6s (No 8x10s). They said they would know for sure when the manager came in at 2pm how long of a wait the fix would be. I asked them to have the manager call me and let me know when she got in at 2. At 3:30 when I called THEM back, they told me they were still unsure and asked if  I want to cancel my order. I told them to cancel it but still to have the manager call me because I wanted to express my dissatisfaction. NEVER DID I GET A PHONE CALL. So today, November 24th, I receive an email telling me that my pictures are ready to be picked up... HAHAHHAA, AS IF. This place is a joke. I understand things aren't perfect and machines break, but atleast have the decency to let your customers know or return calls when you say you will. I live in the apartment right across from this CVS and trust me, I will take my business to the CVS 10 miles away before I step back in this store...
Pas cher, bonne bouffe, grosse bière...endroit idéal pour les évènements sportifs ou pour passer une soirée tranquile entre amis, POUR PAS CHER!
Went through the drive-through to get a coffee and a pastry the girl who helped me was nice and I even gave her a tip. But as I drove away I realized my drink was made incorrectly, even though the tag was marked right it literally was just milk. Frustrated I just bought a 5$ milk- I went back inside to get it remade. I ended up waiting at the drink bar for quite a while. Long enough that other customers noticed how awkward that I was completely being ignored by the barista.  We started to laugh about it like "what did you do to her!? She must hate you!" The girl from the drive-through finally noticed that I had come back- and instead of just walking up and helping me- turned her headset on to communicate to the busy barista that I was waiting to be helped. The barista just looked up at me raised her eyebrows and said "I'm listening" I was so taken aback by how rude she was that I almost felt like walking out. Come on Starbucks I know your location is busy, but start treating your customers with a little respect !

Also my drink still sucked when they remade it.
Tacos. Tequila. Whiskey. How could that combo be bad? 

I was truly hoping that Bakersfield could be "the" place that replaced the likes of Pinche Taco in Denver. The evening didn't start well. Parking is a hot mess but that is just the area. They do offer complimentary valet out of the Berrybrook lot across the street. Limited street parking is it for people that aren't keen on valet.

We started with a Don Julio tequila flight, a cerveza and chips & guac ($7). Honestly, I found it irritating that chips and salsa weren't gratis. I really enjoyed the guac. It was super chunky with the right amount of lime, salt and cilantro. They brought bottles of salsa to go with the tacos, so I sampled those with chips. The green salsa was incredibly mild and slightly bland. The red salsa had a nice smoky flavor and subtle spiciness. 

We ordered an assortment of tacos - pork belly pastor, fish taco, short rib, and a spicy pork. They were served family style on a platter. The food had a visual appeal but none of them blew me away. Especially for $4 a pop. 

Overall, they were close to meeting the 4 star mark. Drop the prices and bring me chips & salsa on the house.
I'm a little shocked at some of the poor reviews of this place. I've gone twice with the first time being my boyfriend's birthday dinner and the second just a dinner out with friends. I would agree that the service here isn't stellar but nothing horrible enough to write\/complain about on a review. 

Pro's: Great patio and indoor atmosphere, great tortillas (I've had the cheddar cheese and red pepper), good food

Con's: Weak margaritas (for the price), limited indoor seating and limited menu

Overall, I had a nice time both experiences and would recommend to others. I would like to go back when the weather is cooler so I can experience the patio.
A good substitute for your usual fast food!  Their parking lot is too small for the lunch rush (minus one star), but at other times it is fine.

I've tried the burgers, fries, tuna sandwich, and chicken sandwich, and have always been satisfied with my order.  Their teriyaki sauce is actually decent.

Only once have I managed to get them to input in the register and correctly leave off the orange garnish that comes with the tuna sandwich.  I can't do citrus, so that takes off a second star.

The Habbit is a nice "fast casual" middle ground between a gourmet burger and Sonic or Wendy's.  I actually prefer them to In-n-Out (better fries), though lack of a drive through makes them less convenient.
This was a great Yelp Find!  Had the typical delivery Chinese food craving so I looked for a good one!  Delivery was quoted about 30-45 minutes and it came in about 40!  I ordered the cashew chicken and crab angels, both were very delicious and was enough for 2 meals! Obviously your not expecting a 5 star restaurant but definitely would order from again!!
This is still my favorite mid range casino.  The room rates are great for what you get.  This time I took advantage of the suite upgrade promotion.  For $104 I got a suite.  The room was nice and spacious.  The bathroom was nicely appointed, and quite large.  My only issue with the room was the couch in the living space was an odd shape that made sitting on it awkward.

Mandalay also has several great food options, cool bars and a few decent shops.  One of these times I need to make my way to the pool, gym and spa.
My first visit to the TR-B and my Brides 4th. Stopped by for a late lunch and it was a mixed bag. Our server, Elizabeth, was an absolute hoot! Pleasant, knowledgeable and engaging which made this visit a pleasure. But we came to eat!

My bride likes their angus burger and wasn't disappointed! I ordered the Nashville chicken and ....well mixed reviews. The chicken was crispy, with a great hot sauce but the portion size was very small. If your going to charge $17.00 for an entree it needs to be more than a lunch portion. The sides, including a personal fav, brussels sprouts, weren't available. So they decided to substitute fries. Nothing special.....

My Brides burger and Elizabeth made this a 3 star otherwise 2 at best!
Had most of their menu by now,  and hard to decide which is my favorite, as it's all excellent.   The calamari is the best I've had in Madison, and the pork belly and Hong Kong pork are delicious.  

Great example of a restaurant focusing on a few dishes and doing them right.
My husband has been jonesing for Zeitouni ever since he started reading the reviews here on Yelp. We went a couple of weeks ago on a weeknight, and I have to say, I'm impressed.

Having traveled to Italy and Greece, we are not strangers to Mediterranean food. Still, it was refreshing to have one of the young men in the restaurant meet our eyes as soon as we walked in, and ask if we'd like an explanation of their menu. He took us over to the case and showed us their kabobs, as well as their sides. He explained how we could order the different combinations, and then left us to confer amongst ourselves.

We each ordered a platter. I ordered the chicken kabobs, my husband ordered the trio of kabobs. We ordered different sides in order to sample them all: hummus for me, babba ghanouj for my husband.

We sat down to wait at a table, and after a few minutes they brought out our orders. Interestingly, our kabobs came with the wrong sides on the plates, but frankly this wasn't an issue since we were just doing a big old taste test of everything we could get.

An older gentleman (perhaps the owner?) came by to present me with a garlic aioli sort of dip for the chicken. It was DELICIOUS and so garlicky! We asked for more, and asked what they called it. "Chicken sauce," he said, with a laugh as he gave away the secret recipe of garlic and fresh mayonnaise. I don't care how simple it was, I loved it.

The food was fresh and delicious. The staff was smiling and friendly. I couldn't ask for more from a restaurant. Well - maybe if it was sit down service with menus, but I won't dock them for that. Zeitouni is what it is - a counter service restaurant. Their food shines beyond "counter service" which implies almost a fast food style. Zeitouni is not "fast food" in my opinion. It's delicious, flavorful and fresh, designed to be savored. So it's a bit of a disconnect, but I forgive them for that because well, if you taste this food, you'd forgive just about anything else.

My recommendation for dining at Zeitouni is that you call ahead and order delicious meals to enjoy in your home. If you're looking for a tasty and fresh lunch, or out for a quick dinner, it's an okay place ambiance-wise, in which to enjoy it, but the fast food feel might turn you off for a date night out. 

Regardless of how you enjoy their food, it is amazingly delicious food that is meant to be enjoyed. We'll be back again and again, but likely with a carryout bag to savor in our home. Zeitouni's food, and it's staff are elevated far beyond the atmosphere you'll find when you walk in.
Upon entering I was greeted by someone, we had a language barrier and she immediately sent someone else over. Now, If you google make sure it's this location- different me is and there is a place with a similar name.
I ordered three items and all were fresh and quite pleasing on the taste buds! My favorite the beef dumplings and pork dumplings! Dipped this into the chili sauce!
You can sit around the outside of the kitchen. The kitchen is clean and all the employees wear gloves:)  I took a picture and a video;)
I've been here a few times before but something is different and not in a good way.. I was quickly seated which was great but couldn't decide what I wanted so I decided to order one Mexican style taco I was told that I couldn't just order one or I would bd charged for chips and salsa I never encountered this before and I've been to several Mexican restaurant when my tacos did come out the tortilla shells were too greasy and I had to send it back the second time the tacos were better but forcing someone to spend a certain amount of money is just wrong I won't be back .
Andi,
Thank you so much for helping us out.  Krista did a amazing job.  She showed up right on time and the boys loved her.  It was so nice to have the convenience again of the mobile service!!!  We are looking forward to going this route from now on.
Have to say I LOVED the malt vinegar mayo and fries but that is all I had so I should probably reserve my judgment until I eat a meal. However Wednesdays were half price wine soooo, I had an A-Ok time :)
Decided to go here on my first trip with an out of towner. Ended up being a pretty good impression. They loved it.

I didn't have a chance to see much of the inside as it was so gorgeous out, I couldn't help but sit on the patio. However, I love the look and feel. It feels homey and comfortable, but almost like your home is in the middle of a tiny forest. 

The food was good. Between our appetizer and our food we left completely stuffed. For a main dish I had to try the much deliberated mac and cheese. While it wasn't the best I've ever had, it was good and a great fit for the night. I paired it with, well, a glass of Kung Fu Girl Riesling... suits me well I think. My visitor had one of the sandwiches with chips and found it perfect. 

The service was on par except for when it came to get our bill. Then, we sat there for 10 minutes and had to flag him down. Additionally, our appetizer came out at the same time as our main dishes.

Food Good. Service Good. Not sure I would come again on my own will, as the menu isn't standing out in my head a week later, but I will probably end up here again somehow, and I won't mind.
3.5\/5! 
I have been here three times and always had great experiences with this place. The servers were incredibly friendly and tentative, despite how busy the restaurant was.

-Seoul Fried Chicken - $19
The fried chicken doesn't have that typical super crispy skin that you would normally get from KFC or Popeyes, instead these had a super thin and ultra-crisp crust like the normal Korean Fried Chicken (which is what I prefer). These were cooked perfectly, super moist, flavourful and coated with a delicious spicy gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste) sauce. The sauce was light, just a bit sweet, and right level of spiciness. Although the chicken was delicious, the sides disappointed me. The kimchi didn't ferment long enough, it tasted like the kimchi is in the in-between stages of being raw and ripe. Also, the kimchi was bland as it didn't have that salty and slightly sour taste I expected of kimchi :(. Same problem with the sweet potato noodle stir fry, bland and didn't taste like anything. 

-Sugo - $28
A must-order-item everytime I come to Lisa Marie! IT. IS. THAT.GOOD. OK. The sugo is an Italian meat sauce, with the brisket braised for 8 hours in a hearty tomato sauce and served with steaming hot home-made breads. Now follow me. Imagine taking a piece of bread, dip it into the red sauce, find chunks of meat (hurray), and eat it. What do you see? Do you see heaven? Do you see that light at the end of the tunnel? It's good right? RIGHT? Yea sorry I don't think I'm making sense here... but seriously I can just bath myself in this sauce LOL. I mean, the dish is so simple, yet it is so delicious.............Light, flavorful, right level of saltiness, what else can you ask for?
Went here to celebrate my wedding anniversary. Made a reservation and asked for a romantic booth and they provided, which was nice. 

Waitress was ok. She was professional and attentive but not the most warm or friendly. She was kind of just straight to the point like let's get your order, get your food, bill and get you out. Not much chatting or enthusiasm in regards to the menu. 

I had heard amazing things about Bandera and we were so excited to try it because we LOVE Houston's -- unfortunately it wasn't as awesome and we thought it'd be. 

Ambience and environment are nice. Good was ok but just not amazing - especially for the price. I was surprised how limited their menu was and just expected more options. I had to try the cornbread bc of the reviews but to me, it was a little dry and was good but not great. Guess I'm used to more buttery, southern home cooking type of cornbread. The steak was ok but Houston's is sooo much better bc of the marinade. My husband made the comment that the sauce on the ribs tasted like chick-fila sauce and it so did!! 

Overall just wasn't too impressed, especially for the price. Glad we tried it but we'll stick to Houston's!

I have a thing for frozen treats... ice cream, soft serve, fro yo, frozen custard... bring it on! Gelato holds a special spot in my tummy... It's one of my fave frozen treats. Charlotte now has a legit gelato place in a great location. This cute little gelato shop popped up in the middle of Park Road Shopping Center. 

Like most gelato shops they had a variety of flavors made with locally sourced ingredients. They had about 8 flavors ranging from the requisite vanilla and chocolate to fresh cantaloupe sorbetto and lemon ricotta. Make sure to sample a few! Every flavor I tried was good. I recommend getting the medium size ($5) which allows you to get up to two flavors! I decided on chocolate and stracciatella. Fantastic combo!

The store was aesthetically pleasing. White building, nicely decorated interior, but the thing I didn't like was how the gelato was presented. I'm used to gelato shops creating elaborate displays of their gelato. I usually pick it based on how good it looks in the tray (yeah, yeah... how vain of me... lol). I couldn't actually see any of the gelato until it was scooped out of the container. I guess it's just different from every other gelato shop I've been to. 

The other minor annoyance... Va Da Vie closes so early! (Hours Tues-Sun 11:30am to 8pm) While I really enjoyed their gelato, I usually want frozen treats after dinner on a Friday or Saturday... well after Va Da Vie closes. 

As many other Yelpers have stated, this is a stand alone building and not a store front in the shopping center.

Overall, I'd recommend checking them out. I'll be back to check out more flavors but not as often as I would like simply because of their hours.
The service here can be slow at times, and they don't have much for vegetarians, but the veggie burger they do have is pretty good.  Their salad is interesting, with beets in the mix, and I admit that even though I'm not usually a fan of them, I'll eat them in this salad.  The real benefit to this place is that it's open 24\/7, so if you want to go to a bar or grab some food late night, this is definitely an option.
I cannot express enough the gratitude I have for this group of IBCLCs. Without a doubt, my family owes our success to them. They helped me come to terms with having low supply, while offering suggestions to try to improve it. They diagnosed my son's tongue tie after a doctor did not. I felt like their guidance was more in line with my instincts, which was settling to me during a very emotional time. These women mean more to my husband and I than any other professionals we have encountered during our parenthood thus far.
A little sad, sparsely merchandised (lots of empty spots on the shelves), and with a surprising amount of non-Japanese goods like Ziploc bags and Hunt's tomato sauce.  I did find one of the small individually wrapped shiro daifuku mochi in the "grab and go" case, and noticed they did have Lotte mochi ice in a standing cooler by the wall coolers.

Overall, I was really disappointed with their offerings.  New Tokyo, Lee Lee, and Super L are definitely superior.  All three carry multipacks of mochi, though only Lee Lee and Super L have the fresh stuff.  Maybe their focus is on the restaurant type spot at the front of the shop now?
Not bad.  Bumping them up a little in stars for the very pleasant cashier.  They hadn't gotten a delivery today, so the selection was skimpy.  I ordered a pistachio macaron, which was a little dry but had a genuine pistachio taste and a delightful surprise of chocolate inside.

Cost for one macaron: $1.50, which isn't bad compared to other places.
I needed a quick take out lunch so popped in here to grab a maki roll. Previously this was Kim's Ichiban. They re-organized the restaurant so there is more seating. I was not a big fan of Kim's before but based on the roll I ordered, I feel the quality has gone down. I ordered the Double Spicy Salmon with 10 pieces for $11. It was supposed to come with spicy salmon, avocado, cucumber, topped with spicy salmon and fish eggs. No avocado, they stretched it so there is 10 pieces, and the rolls consistency was horrible. Sub par to AYCE or even food court. I hope the quality becomes better.
Oh, sure, sure, it's not without its flaws. It's changed hands and they're not consistent on the service (I was sitting there for about ten minutes before someone toddled over my way, but to fair, I had my laptop open so I didn't really look like I was waiting). Also, I have learned the hard way that their wifi just ain't friendly. Luckily, I can hotspot from my phone with no problems, but others aren't so fortunate, I'm sure.

But in a way, I kind of have to give 'em points for bringing me the wrong drink, because I always, always have a "red fruits tea" when I'm in here, and this time, I asked for redbush. The young lady taking my order (and payment at the end) got this bit right. But the staff member responsible for making and bringing my drink brought me, not what I asked for, but the similar-sounding drink that I normally have. Which is pretty cute actually, and not really grounds for feeling upset (especially since they're the same price, I think).

The croque madame has undergone a makeover. It used to be simply bread, some ham, great melted cheese, and then the egg. No longer - now it is two entire sandwiches, filled with cheesy white sauce, topped with melty melty cheese, sprinkled with chopped ham, and egged in finery with a fried egg done just right.

Side note: they now display their macarons on one of those confusing wizard-hat arrangements. I do not understand the magic wizard's hat of macarons that appears to be so ubiquitous. Why do they not lie flat? Why are they thus inclined to the zenith?

Anyway, again I say - that PLAYLIST, dude.
I think Whole Foods and Giant Eagle Market District are competing for the title of most annoying place to shop. It all starts with the parking experience, which is ridiculously horrible at this location - very poorly planned. And then, there's the prices - Giant Eagle being quite expensive compared to similar grocers in other cities, Whole Foods obviously has to get a one up on those; it's inherent in the scheme of selling premium "natural" goods. Whole Foods does have better lighting and layout than GE, and yes, a more discriminative selection of products, especially for people with specialized diets, like vegans (me) and gluten free adherents. The house baked bread here might be worse than GE (tough contest) - often under baked and thus soggy in middle and crusts tend to fall off; making gluten free-dom seem appealing. And I don't even need to talk about customer demographics, because you've all seen Rachel C.'s link!
This was the first restaurant I went to, upon moving here to Vegas.  Great first impressions!  I'm a vegetarian, so I had the tofu burrito.  I can't remember everything I had on it, but there are so many options.  The place was crammed when we were there - and no wonder.  I love the fusion of sushi and Mexican.  You wouldn't think these two things could go together, but they do, and it's yummy.  Definitely plan on returning here.
A generous antipasto, full of fresh ingredients with a flavorful dressing started our meal. Our pizza was delivered before our second mouthful of salad. It to was fresh with generous toppings but a bit dry with to little sauce for my taste. When near to Arboretum give it a try!
Six dollars coconut based ice cream. The ice cream itself is pretty good but the waffle is stupidly thin that the ice cream seeps out if you don't eat it fast enough. Last time it was cash only so be prepared.
Drive by and place caught my friends eye.    Server was a delight and the Food all freshly prepared was FANTASTIC !     

A must visit restaurant in roncesvalles
Second Trip to this Modern Asian Fusion place in the last three weeks! Truly Outstanding!. I have seen it packed,  as it was tonight,   ( Sat. Nite ) and empty on a late lunch day 3 weeks ago. Both times I have had great service and delicious food.  Starting out,  its ultra modern with a gorgeous Wooden tree in the middle of the bar. Speaking of the bar..Outstanding Mixologist there. ..they muddle fresh fruit into sake and alcohol and even non alcoholic sparkling drinks. I have had the blackberries with  lychee and sake  and also the Cucumber mint and ginger drink. Refreshing and delcious! I have now had the Banh Mi Sandwich twice - first time it was the Caramel Pork and tonight it was the Pork Belly. The best I have had in Charlotte and I have been here 12 years!  Crispy fresh bun with sweet cucumber and hot pepper slices and a  great sauce! Tried the fried Rice tonight and it was a nice size helping with fresh tomato and peas and fresh cilantro --loved it. My sister is a vegetarian and they had a vegan and also a Gluten free menu. She had Spring Egg rolls with lemongrass. They were great. We also tried the Green Papaya Salad...that was crisp and fresh and authentic ! It is in the Old  ( Newly Remodeled) Park Road Shopping Center...Don't miss this place..You will come back again and again!
It's fine.  I consider it "healthy fast food."  The cashier was friendly enough, and the seating and decor are solid fast food restaurant style.

I only came here to appease the appetites of someone else.  I wouldn't come back on my own accord as I don't care for the food.
Wow, what an incredible experience. Top notch service from the doorman, to the hostess, to the server, and the manager. All were so helpful and genuinely cared about my party's over all experience. The drinks were beyond beautiful, and tasted like an explosion of flavors in my mouth. I highly recommend anything containing passionfruit! This is a hidden gem in Phoenix, and they truly take pride in the exceptional service they offer. Blown away, and will be recommending to anyone and everyone visiting downtown.
This is our usual place to stay when we come to Montreal as it is closest to our family. This time we did not book a room because we were supposed to stay with family. When that family had a member suddenly become ill and hospitalized, we scrambled to get a room here. We needed three nights but were only able to get one to start. BUT Ruby Foo's put us top on a wait list and we were able to get the extra nights! Thank you to Frank who went out of his way to find us at breakfast to tell us the good news! We have slept really well on the good mattresses! From now on, forget staying with family! We are staying here always!
Recommended by my bestie .. even so i rarely go to the shows but going to concerts and stuff is really fun to hangout with the kids or friends .. they do offer same show certain times they will appear some concerts kinda makes me mad coz its always sold out but thank god i have my bestie to call me about a concert so i can reserve it right away lol.
Great place... good people, fun atmosphere, fair prices, yummy drinks, and live entertainment! Other than that, I don't have much to say since we only came here for drinks.
It used to be a Chevy's Bar and grill about 9 yrs ago. The building is almost 30 years old with interior to match. This breakfast and brunch spot is more suited for an older clientele which surrounds it. 
We took my father in law to brunch and he was satisfied. The chicken fried steak my wife had seemed uncooked in the middle. The potatoes tasted like they came out of a bag. My Denver omelette was small even though I added a half a dozen more ingredients to it. My tomato slices which I subbed in for bread were fresh and tasty.  
On a positive note, the service was excellent.  
I would only return at the request of my father in law who enjoys this resturaunt.
Seeing as how bacon cheeseburgers are one of my favorite dishes in the universe, I'm probably a bit biased and more judgmental of my burger feasts. I'm kiiiind of a burger snob.

With that being said, Five Guys Burgers and Fries gets it. Everyone wants good seasoned burgers, crispy bacon, mounds of cheese and greasy spicy fries. AMIRITE!?

Well, at least that's what I like - an artery clogging meal that is filling and satisfying. Just as long as you don't eat here every week, I see no harm in indulging every once in a while.

Nothing but great things to say about the food, the workers and the location!

A little tip: be sure to add jalapeños to your burger & order the Cajun fries for stomach churning night adventures. NO REGRETS!
On a girls trip from NYC. Everything was great from the start of the reservation with Sylvia to being timely in our pick up and drop off to the drivers who looked professional and extremely courteous. I honestly will say they made my night out awesome! The rates reasonable and well worth it!
This is definitely NOT a smokehouse or BBQ joint I would ever recommend to anyone. It's a weird concept because they also have fair food too (funnel cakes, corn dogs, etc.) There were 4 in our party that came in on a Saturday night- it was pretty dead inside whereas all the restaurants in the surrounding areas had waits\/lines out the door. There's a large smoker and BBQ pit in the middle of the restaurant and there was NOTHING going on in this area! I was scared the food had already been made and we were just going to get stuff warmed up. 

Our waitress was completely clueless- whenever we asked her a question she had to bring other servers and even the bartender over to answer anything. We weren't asking anything crazy- just if they could make a Mai Tai. Even though they have a "full bar", 3 of the drinks requested couldn't be made because they didn't carry that specific liquor. My friend finally decides to order a shot of Jack and said the alcohol seemed "watered down". 

Food arrives and parts of mine were cold (mac and cheese and the meats were barely warmed). I went with the 2 meat (chicken and pulled pork). During our meal, our waitress takes away the BBQ sauces to "refill them", even though they were more than half way full. I hardly ate my food because everything tasted re-heated and awful!! 

Stay far fary away from here!
A-Ok! I work nearby and stopped in for some all you can eat lunch with my husband yesterday. I have been a few times before but it had been a long time. 

12.99 each for the AYCE and they had a very good selection. We got our money's worth with a few rolls (spicy salmon, shrimp tempura, butterfish), some nigiri (salmon, butterfish), green salads, miso soup, delicious green tea.

It was an enjoyable experience, friendly and attentive service (although they weren't very busy) and quality fish and not too much rice (a sushi pet peeve). I'd return but it's wasn't anything I haven't had elsewhere.
I had a great experience overall. I had the technician check my AC unit for leaks and freon while I was in AZ. He didn't find any issues, and the inspection fee was very inexpensive, about 3-4 times less than what I would have paid at the dealer. I love finding legitimate shops that won't "find something wrong" just to make a buck. I recommend this shop to anyone in the Tempe \/ Mesa area.
People that know me well know that I am a caffeine junkie and coffee snob. Yes, I frequent the corporate chains for the convenience and free wi-fi, but not for the quality of the coffee. Enter Not Just Coffee. Love the location, social atmosphere and friendly (and knowledgeable) employees. They pay attention to the small details that matter... Like warming up your coffee mug with hot water before serving you your freshly brewed cup of heaven. If you are not familiar with the craft brewing scene... that is craft coffee brewing... then bookmark Not Just Coffee immediately! Go order a pour over, hot or iced, and enjoy it in its purest form... black. no sugar. no cream. just don't. You can thank me later.
Overall, Menchie's in a decent fro-yo option in the Dilworth area. 

Plenty of flavors to try. Most are sweet with only 2 tart options when I visited. The flavors do rotate. I liked the consistency, not too creamy and not icy.  Some of the flavors definitely made me think soft serve and not fro yo... Good? Bad? Undecided. But I noticed that it melted really fast. By the time I dispensed it into my cup, put the toppings on, and paid for it, there was a decent melted pool in the bottom of my cup. That made me a little sad. They had some samples of their fresh made waffle cones\/bowls. Delish. I would definitely recommend their waffle products!

I teeter totter between liking self-serve vs. full serve fro yo places. Menchie's is a self-serve joint. Which means: 
a) You can sample as many flavors as you want. Just grab the small paper sample cups on the counter. 
b) You can put all 12 flavors in one cup if you so desire
c) You can top away and decorate to your hearts desire.

But I must warn you, self serve places definitely have their negatives. 
a) So, when you pay by the ounce you gotta be careful how much you put in that cup. They only offer one size cup, which is quite large(!) and easy to fill if you aren't swift handed with the dispensing lever. The toppings bar is quite dangerous as well... Fill up your cup too much and you may be walking away with an $8 cup of fro yo. My cup was around $5 and I felt like I went pretty easy filling up the cup. It was maybe 1\/2 full. 
b) Toppings are also self-serve... I try not to think of the bogger picking little fingers that have been all over those scoops. But hey, some germs never killed anyone right... think of it as free immune system training! 
c) The toppings bar options weren't that great\/healthy. They had plenty of dry toppings - crushed cookies, cereal, gummi bears, choco chips, and many other hfcs laden options. But I thought the fresh fruit area was lacking. The fruit I saw was cut into large, unappealing chunks and some of it didn't look all that fresh. 
 
While not my favorite fro yo joint in the QC, it does deserve a mention. I like this location better than other Menchie's locations I've visited (it's a franchise). Sign up for a Smileage card if you are a frequent visitor.
The courtyard has lots of mature trees and a saltwater pool. I loved living here and really miss it. Everyone was really nice and helpful.
We were in the area and absolutely starving and I had a craving for pub fare, so this seemed to fit the bill, especially because it's had a few good reviews, but I found it only so-so. 

Decor: Another reviewer mentions that the decor seems to be missing something and I agree. It's boring. The booths had gaps where the seat meets with the wooden bench part that holds the seat part up. Hard to describe, but looks cheap and crappy, like they're broken. Our table was very unbalanced and the waitress came and stuck a coaster under it so it would stop rocking. It's small and very cramped. 

Food: Selection was pretty standard pub fare, but a bit on the expensive side. I ordered a chicken curry dish and when they asked if I wanted it to be spicy or mild I asked for it to be mild. Either their mild is just VERY spicy and I would hate to try their actual spicy, or they made a mistake. The curry comes with the chicken in sauce, rice and a sort of fried crisp, which was nice. The rice was bland however...or the spice from the curry killed my tastebuds. 
My husband chose a burger, which was overall very good, although they charged him two dollars each for bacon and cheese on the burger, which is expensive when your burger is already $15. Not sure the bacon added anything, but the cheese, I'll admit was really good on this burger. 

Atmosphere and Service: Service was fine. BUT, since this seems to be a trend...or the gods are intent on making me detest children while eating out, we had another loud, rude child\/negligent parent situation (see post on Malaysian place). Another situation where children were screaming and running around and parents were sitting off, by themselves, ignoring them, while the rest of the people in the restaurant had to suffer. The group of older individuals across from us kept leaning over to make comments to us and the two ladies nearby grumbled under their breath. 

Once again, this was a problem that could easily have been solved by the restaurant. The kids were part of a party and were in a party room, which is adjacent, but separate from the rest of the dining room. This room had doors on it...which CLOSE, but were propped wide open. All the waitress had to do was go and quietly shut the doors. That's it! Problem solved. 

We were getting annoyed and so we didn't bother ordering dessert. Too bad, because they actually looked great. The group across from us ordered a few and were commenting on how good they were.

So yeah...I actually would have given this pub 2 stars even without the screaming kid, but if the screaming kid had not been a problem, we probably would have stayed for dessert and who knows, maybe these guys would be getting 3+ stars. That said, it just didn't do it for me. Overpriced, for only okay food and poor atmosphere.
Love the warm inviting space, and they pass the soy cappuccino test with flying colors! I don't think I would bother trying to enjoy coffee drinks anywhere else on the Southside now that I've tried hanging with the Big Dog.
Came to get a pedi and full set. So far this place is amazing  Great customer service. I recommend Vince, He does an amazing job on full set. Nu and Sophia are great at pedicure. Just love everything about the place
Opened by Pickle Barrel, Glow is meant to be this new healthy eating restaurant that ensures you do not over indulge on certain foods. They have burgers that are served bunless and a side of salad - so make sure you read the fine print prior to order to ensure you get what you want.

The food is ok, not memorable. The atmosphere and decor is beautiful. And the service was not bad - after hearing all the horror stories I thought we would be getting terrible service.

They also have these 100 calories shooter glass desserts that are cute, but also not memorable in taste.

I think this place is probably good for a drink (for the atmosphere and decor), but not so much for their food.
Very slow service times we went. Its also on the expensive side for their sandwich. Otherwise very nice sandwiches and they sell cream soda in bottles.
I remember this place as Jimmy Woo's (I'm still a little sad it's gone) but Morning Squeeze was a nice stop end stop for the Yelp Shopping Crawl for Local Businesses. We were served a breakfast buffet and received 2 drink coupons, with a choice of a Mimosa or a Bloody Mary. Same layout as before just different color scheme to Jimmy's, there's 2 bars (one outdoors and one indoors, outdoor patio seating and indoor seating). Kitchen is open and booths surround the restaurant with varying tables. Food and everything was OK, drinks were nice, atmosphere was probably my favorite. I would return if I was in the area and looking for a breakfast\/brunch hangout spot in Old Town!
I was first introduced to Louie's noodles by a friend who had recently made a trip out to Vegas.  I have had fresh noodles which were purchased at local Chinese markets but nothing was as good as Louie's.  As Christy L. mentions, though the noodles are frozen they still retain a chewy texture which is pretty unique.  I think the only comparable wonton noodles are the ones I have while in Hong Kong.  Don't expect anything fancy when purchasing noodles here.  Just a simple office desk along with a tv screen listing items for sale along with pricing.  Glad we brought a cooler with us as we filled it with various noodles to bring back to LA.  Now if only they would have a distributor in the LA area.  Make sure to bring cash as that's all they'll accept.
Love love love!!! The peel and eat shrimp with their house sauce is the best. Their heat levels are higher than normal--mild has a nice kick and medium is hot hot hot! Scared to try the hot! French fries dipped in the sauce are heavenly. The worst part--you have to go home and shower and do laundry, the garlic and spice is so strong I can smell it in my clothes and hair. Nonetheless it's totally worth it!! I love this restaurant.
I work in the area so visit this location frequently. I usually stop here for coffee and a bagel. I've never tried their ice cream.

They've always been friendly and prompt with me. I'll continue to visit them.
Went with my friend as we had purchased the Groupon back in April. Before the Groupon, reviews were pretty good for this place. But not sure if it is because of the amount of Groupons they sold, their service and attitude has gone downhill.

We were a little late for our appt, but we had called ahead to notify them (only to get the answering machine). When we got there, the receptionist was rude and said, typically we don't take appts that are this late, as we are booked back to back, but this time we will take you in. And when we looked around the salon, there was only 2 other people getting their nails done.

The two girls that did our nails were really nice. My friend kept smudging her almost dried nails, so they had fixed it for her twice.

At the end of the day, we had to pay the $1.25 HST on top of the tips.

Overall, we would not go back again.
I had a yummy lunch with my lunch crowd the other day.  We went to a place called Thai Foon.  It's a thai place.  Clever huh?  I had the "Shrimp Jap Chap".  The last few times I've been there I ordered the Pad Thai, which was excellent, but I don't like sticking with the same thing too long. . . it's a character flaw.  So I'd never heard of Shrimp Jap Chap, but that made it intriguing.

The waitress asked me what I wanted and I told her, "Shrimp Slap Chop", but she didn't crack a smile and just wrote down "Shrimp Jap Chap."

We waited at our table, which was a round, but somehow too small.  Everyone seemed too far away, and if one of us pulled it close enough the rest were way too far. 

A little asian man came over with our food.  He said, "Shi-sha-sho?"

"What?" I said, confused.

"Shi-sha-sho?" Just as quickly, just as unintelligibly.  I turned it over and over in my mind for what seemed like an uncomfortably long time, but for what was, in all actuality maybe a second at most. 

"That's mine," I said.  I wasn't positive that it was, but I figured that's just how you said it, if you were from Thailand.  The rest of the table looked quizzically at me.  I looked up.  "Shrimp Jap Chap. . . shi-sha-sho."  I gestured at the bowl of noodles with my fork.  They chuckled.

It was excellent.  We finished and stood to pay at the counter.  The woman there was NOT thai.  She asked me which meal ticket was mine.  I pointed and said, "Shi-sha-sho!"  I'd been practicing.  She had no idea what I was talking about.  "Shrimp Jap Chap", I sighed, disappointed.

Good lunch.
great pizza by the slice.  I really don't know why this place isn't more popular, it is quite good pizza!
I discovered this gem while bringing a special someone out here for a dinner date. The view is absolutely phenomenal since the restaurant sits right on the lake in a secluded setting. The decor of this place is great and I love this place because it is fancy food in a laid back setting. The server was awesome very friendly and very pleasant. Our food was just as great I had the tilapia dish with a salad and it was perfect. If your looking for a place with great food and a view this is the place to be.
Recently we did a large delivery order through Uber Eat and everything was pretty good. We were happy with the portions and everything tasted good. Dishes were not too oily and food came hot and within the expected time.
I really like this place. It has a really great vibe and I love supporting the community while getting great food! I highly recommend the friend flounder, collard greens & mac & cheese. delish!
Cash only unless above $10 (debit only). We used to go here all the time for their steamed pork buns, its adequately stuffed with pork! Lots of selection for sweet cake rolls, and bubble tea.
A pizza place in the Wynn.  An interesting idea.  If you need a quick bite or are looking to save some money this is a good place to eat.  Ideal for lunch.  The views of the water features outside are great.

The pizza is good.  Not quite authentic New York, but its as close as you are going to get any where near the west coast.  I tried the carne with pepperoni, sausage and ham.  It was pretty good.  The crust is super thin.

I also tried the garlic knots.  They are just ok.  They lack that strong garlic flavor.
This place was awesome. Got there around midday and it was already kicking. People were everywhere and it was so hot. Hard to find anywhere to put towels down but everyone was cool about sharing space.
Ended up sitting behind this day bed where guys were licking chocolate from girl's bodies, it was off the hook to see this and they girls just didn't care, they were having an awesome time.
Took us a while to get into the water but when we did, wow. Splashing water everywhere, DJ playing amazing tracks, we were just missing some girls on our side but the eye candy around the cabanas and dancing on the pool edge was brill. There were some lesbians dancing next to us which was wild.

The pool was not very clean but we knew about this, we had to experience this once in our lives and we are glad we did. Spoke to some people who said it was much better than Wet Republic because it was more relaxed and all about having a good time.

Hard to get drinks but the atmosphere was enough to get high on.
Friendly employees who remember you and chat with you. 
Yes, I not only go here to refill my car with gas...they have Thrifty ice cream.  An assortment of ice creams and sherbet as well.  The employees always offer you a taste- damn them;)
Smell of chocolate is evident as soon as you walk in. Nice store with samples to try on second floor.
Henderson Nissan is located in Henderson on Auto Show Drive right off of the expressway. They have a large inventory of vehicles and they have a great sales staff.

I bought my 2012 Nissan Maxima from here and I paid way too much for the vehicle, but at least I like the dealership and the staff...lol. I am very happy with the vehicle. I have not had any major issues with the vehicle and it drives very well.

This place has an excellent service center. I still drive all the way here from Summerlin for service and oil changes just because of the quality of the service you receive as opposed to Auto Nation Nissan on W Sahara, which is much closer to my house.

I would definitely recommend coming here for service or to purchase a vehicle.
J'ai été pour l'évènement #Mtlatable. 29$ pour un menu trois service. Laissez-moi vous dire que le service y était :) Au menu: Terrine avec gelé de fruit, comme plat principal, Osso Buco, boeuf ou saumon et comme dessert Mousse au Chocolat ou une sorte de bavarois dans de la crème anglaise.

Notre serveur, Laurent était un très bon hôte. La nourriture correcte. La présentation du plat que j'ai pris...Osso Buco superbe...mais il manquait de saveur, mais wow la qualité de la viande impécable. Mon ami lui a fait la remarque à notre serveur et lors du dessert, il nous a ammener un verre de cidre :) 

Bref, c'est certain que je veux y retourner!
Now, after being a Britney fan for over fifteen years, I can finally say I've seen her live!  I have to admit, I wish she was singing live and not lip-syncing.  That's not too much to ask from a pop star who's been in the business for so long.  That being said, she, her dancers, and the set designers do a LOT to make you forget this vital fact, so it still manages to be a very entertaining show.  Lots of songs to sing and dance along to, that's one thing I loved about it, as well. Definitely worth seeing if you like her music!
Ugh I can't stand this place. The only reason it gets two stars is because I can walk there and it's an okay place to day drink and eat some chips and salsa.  On Cinco de Mayo, they block of the parking lot and fill it with sand and then you have to wait 30 minutes to get in.  And then pay.  

Friday and Saturday nights are lame-o.  Guys have to pay $5.00.  If you're in heels, forget walking in the sand.  The dance floor fills with a bunch of drunks around midnight.  The crowd is definitely not "Scottsdale", but it's something.....more like skater boy meets Affliction meets arm band tattoos.  And that's just the guys.  

I've just spend a few too many nights here either with friends that actually like it or as a last resort so we can stumble home....and haven't had a good time, EVER.
Beat Poutine in town,  open 24hrs but not open Mondays!
Forget that other place that has tons of selection, this ones authentic...secrets in the sauce
We had a really good experience here!  We wanted to try a new, local place and because we drive by here frequently, it was time to give it a try.  

After checking out the website and menu ahead of time, we decided there that were lots of food we wanted to try with prices not being so cheap.  Therefore, happy hour on a Saturday from 2-6pm seemed like a great idea.  And it was.  

Tapas were 2 dollars off, so we tried the Spinach Artichoke and Caprese.  Caprese was definitely above average for me, and the dip was good as well.  Alrighty.  On to main courses.  I had to order the Mac and Cheese with a side salad, if only because the boyfriend wanted to try it.  Side salad again was more than I expected with dark lettuce, cucumbers, and tomatoes.  The Mac and Cheese was crispy on the top, yum, but we had to ask for salt and pepper to flavor it.  The boyfriend had the Grilled Chicken sandwich, which he says was very tasty.  I had to sneak a couple fries from his plate....they were crispy deliciousness.  

Wow, we had a lot of food!  Plenty to take home!  But for all that plus 2 glasses of wine and a big beer it was only $51.00 with tax!  We'll be back for happy hour, and this time will stick to the tapas and drinks.
Great service and happy hour specials. Pretzels are a must with two yummy dipping sauces - one was a wasabi mustard sauce and I couldn't stop eating it. The pizzas were good with unique toppings (grapes and goat cheese!). Tumeric butter wings were interesting but I wouldn't need to order them again. Love the patio which has a cute little grass space with games. Will definitely return!
Oh, THIS is how you do it. This. Right here. Classic Nouveau design in the auditorium meets chic ultra-modern comfort in the foyer.  The huge glass-fronted foyer goes up three storeys, and never feels crowded even in the pre-show buzz. I can't believe I haven't reviewed the Festival Theatre before given how many times I've come here and loved it. They do everything right.

Unlike so many theatres of its size, the Festival Theatre is spacious and light in the foyer, and even the toilets don't feel as cramped as most theatres. The interval snack prices are no more wince-worthy than other places (we're talking £3 for a tub of ice cream - but yes, still I stick to my five-star guns, because that's not unusual).

Even with the Playhouse in town, it holds its own with a ferocious mix of programming that spans the popular and esoteric alike, from Warhorse to the Rambert Dance Company. The shows tend to have short runs, too, meaning you get some really excitingly inventive shows with sets that are designed to tour more easily than their extended-residency counterparts. As the home venue of the Edinburgh International Festival, it's a theatre that prides itself on progressive and intellectual art while still catering to audiences of a sufficient size to populate its impressive and rich auditorium. (Standing ovations are somewhat vertigo-inducing up in the Gods, mind you - it's pretty steeply raked and you might feel safer just clinging to the arms of your chair..!)

It even has its own tragic history and a mysterious haunting story. What more could you possibly want from a house of art and superstition?
I went here last week with a friend, and it was fantastic.  First of all, I love that they make the guacamole right in front of you.  Very cool!  (And also, it was very delicious!)  I got the vegetarian fajitas (YUM!), and I had enough food for two more meals later - so definitely  value for your money.  The service was also fantastic.  I didn't even have to run out of water before the waiter was at my table giving me more.  I think we had maybe three different waiters attending to different things at our table.  All in all, my friend and I felt very well taken care of!  I recently moved here from the Midwest... never going to eat Mexican back home again.  I'm too spoiled now!  Great experience, and delicious food!
Found this place looking for an alternative to the tourist clogged overpriced restaurants on the strip.  It looked like a roadside diner from my younger days in New York and we decided to try it.  It was after noon but I opted for the hash and eggs breakfast.  The hash is definitely not out of a can.  The corned beef was ample and it wasn't pasty like number 10 can hash.  The eggs were cooked to order and hash browns were the wide shredded style and NOT over cooked!!  I also liked that the food wasn't over salted in some lame attempt to generate flavor out of a can.  I was able to add salt and pepper to my taste.
Our server was great. It was crowded, not packed, and she took good care of us.  The food arrived soon after we ordered, it was hot and more than enough to fill you up.  The prices were reasonable and a lot better than the $3.50 hotel Starbucks tall coffee I had this morning
We had to head back to the conference, and I admired the pies on the way out.  We didn't have time for dessert however the manager boxed one for us.  We enjoyed the banana cream pie the next day waiting on the TSA line.  That started a few conversations with our fellow travelers!
The garage has the best service, Kevin helped me and answered my questions, he even told me I did not need an oil change yet and should just follow the percentage level in my car reading.  They did a great job on the paint of my bumper and even washed my car inside and out.  By far the best service garage for your Honda.
Never got to the food because after being seated on a mildly busy Friday night (4\/20\/12) we sat for 15 minutes without being acknowledge by ANY of the wait staff. The straw that broke the camel's back was when the waitress working our area stood next to my wife and took the drink order of a recently arrived guest then walked away. She didn't have the courtesy to even look at us. Good news is we left and had a GREAT TIME at Brio's just across the street and they got my 25% tip for GREAT service.
After signing up for their e-mail list, I was pleasantly surprised to find a $25 coupon sitting in my e-mail for my birthday. I had only been to the Keg once before (a very long time ago) so I was very excited to try again and take my boyfriend, who had never been. We did go on a weeknight (coupon stipulation for weekends) but liked the fact that it wasn't as hectic and busy as on a weekend night. Since it was my birthday dinner, my boyfriend I got all dressed up and went out for a nice dinner.

We were seated immediately at a spacious booth next to a large fireplace. The ambience reminded me of an upscale lodge. Our server was very attentive and charismatic. He made our experience fun but not overwhelming us with unnecessary visits to our table. We were given a loaf of wonderful bread to start. Our server made awesome dinner selections, including my boyfriend's filet oscar entree. I went with the 10 oz filet mignon and a side of steamed veggies. We ordered our steaks cooked medium and medium rare. Both were cooked very well. Everything we ate was top notch!

The best part comes with dessert! The GM came over to our table and not only wished me a Happy Birthday with his adorable baby boy in his arms but gave us a free Miner Pie. OMG it was incredible!! I think the idea of giving us that kind of service was better than the actual pie for dessert.

For the food and service we received, the prices were on point. The Keg is not a cheap place but is very delicious and service was great. I will definitely return and my boyfriend even said he would return for his birthday dinner in the summertime :)
The best place in Cleveland. The beef cheek pirogi is essential to every visit. The seasonal soups are great and imaginative. For lunch get the baloney sandwich, it's amazing and nothing like mom ever made. The other essential are the French fries, they are spiced to be addictive, and when accompanied by Michael's secret catsup, you will be hooked. Do not miss desert, they are all good but the waffle with bacon ice cream is the winner. And yet it gets better, the wine list is exceptional, good selections and a wide price range respectful of any budget, and it's on an iPad that makes it great fun. All good.
I've eaten here a couple of times. Great food! Friendly staff! Excellent ambiance.

Can't wait to visit here again.
Hilldale houses some decent stores but the inside is like an airport and a lot of the retail spaces are empty. I was there on a Saturday but surprisingly 
There is an attached gourmet supermarket and nearby Target. Sundance cinema is also a part of the shopping center which apparently features a few big name movies but mostly indie films. They have a neat bar offering coffee\/sandwiches\/wine\/beer all to be enjoyed outside in the lounge area featuring really lovely leather couches and rustic wooden tables. If you are there to enjoy a movie you can take the food and drink inside the theater.
When I was asked to help out and take one of my favorite little kids to a birthday party here, I wasn't exactly jumping with excitement.  Upon arrival, we were greeted and asked to sign the waiver and put our present in the designated bin.  Easy enough.

Then our group of 10 4- and 5-year olds headed into the first bounce area.  The children took off to play, with fun music blaring.  Umm....dare I admit I wish I had socks so I could go play too?  A staff member told me they recently had held a 40th birthday party there - interesting!  After a half hour or so they moved into a second bounce area for another half hour, followed by some games lead by the staff there.  Both spaces were different enough to keep the children engage.  There were also a couple benches for parents that want to sit and relax.  

We then moved into a party room for pizza and cake.  The room was pretty large, appropriately decorated, and had big windows.  I think the birthday boy loved the big chair and all the attention!  

As an expecting parent and practically a professional babysitter - this is definitely a place you want your child to go for a birthday party!  He'll be half dead and ready for an early bedtime, that's for sure!
Great time!  The rooms are really nice and the shower is pretty cool. We had a great view of the pool...
We just returned from our inaugural visit to Agora, and I am thrilled to have found this Greek gem. Steve (the owner) could not have been more nice or informative. He was generous with the samples of feta and olives as we decided what to buy.

All of our standard Greek favorites were there: barrel aged feta, kalamata olives, large canisters of imported Greek olive oil, tzatziki and Ion bars. We stocked up on our "usuals", but we were eyeing other things to pick up on another visit. They had some amazing looking chicken and pork souvlaki in the refrigerator case at a great price. Next time, we're getting some. In fact, all of the prices are incredibly reasonable.

If you want the best Greek groceries available in Charlotte, I highly recommend Agora! It's a haul for us, coming from Ballantyne, but it's a trip well worth making!
Very helpful! Removed a side mirror from my car that was broken and causing damage at no cost. Friendly and reliable. I will go back to them once I want to get the mirror replaced!
Good Roti and long lines pretty much sums up Shandra's. 

If you come during lunch, it's always busy. Good roti and limited seating makes for long lines and lots of take out orders. The first time I went I actually had to wait 15 minutes in line, and I was thinking "this better be the best d@mn roti I've ever had". Alas, it wasn't, but it's good and hits the spot when you're in the mood for some Caribbean cuisine.

The roti is good but compared to other Roti restaurants around the GTA it's not special. It is a great option if you want roti, as there aren't many places to grab roti in the immediate area and you won't be disappointed with the quality of the food.

The cost is about $8-10 for a roti, depending on what you get. I think the best roti they have there is the goat. They also have a jerk chicken roti which is interesting and it's also popular.  As something else mentioned, the "boneless" chicken may have one or two straggling bones left behind, but I've only found one bone in the two times I've had it.  Being roti, it's heavy and one roti will fill you up, unless you an abnormally large eater. 

One thing to note, they do close relatively early, I think around 7 pm so don't try this spot for dinner (on weekdays at least).
I adopted my baby kitty nearly 10 years ago as a child. My dad took me here in search of a kitty because I begged to have one. We came several times to see the kitties available and make sure we bond with the kitty before adopting. I like that they have a cat room to sit and play with the cats. This really helps with interaction. Some cats are in cages however. It was just then, after a few visits later, I was about to enter the kitty room and noticed this cutie calico in a cage by the desk, meowing desperately to get out, pawing the trash can to tip over. I knew she was the one !! We chose her , she was ready in a few days with certificate of adoption, microchipped and I named her Sheila. Took her to the vet to be neutered\/spayed. She's my little darling and best friend to this day. I can say my experience here was great. I didn't feel rushed and the atmosphere is great. It's clean and doesn't smell (but it's been years since I've been here so I can't say if it's changed). I would recommend this place because it's close by in western pa and I had a memorable experience.
Not a gourmet dining experience, but the service is great, and the food is delicious!  I had their fruit pancakes, and they are soooo good.  I'm a healthy eater, so I didn't use the butter or syrup I was given.  They were perfect as they were, with tons of fruit baked into them.  I've also come here and gotten dinner, as well.  Yummy veggie burger!  I'll definitely be back again.
All you can eat and a great buzz from sake. That's what sushi night is all about. I love that this place is open late. After I get off of work, most places are closing. People have to wait for a seat sometimes, but that just means this place is that good. Great people work there.
I've been going to guru lukshmi since they had their stall in the Newin centre way back when (I wasn't even in High School yet!). 

The food has always been consistently fantastic. Their sambhar is always rich and flavourful, the chutnies perfect and the dosas just divine. 

The restaurant can get packed so make sure you make a reservation or avoid going at peak hours. 

My recommendation: Start with baby idlis in sambhar or rasam vada, then go for the mysore masala or coriander dosa (the latter if you can't tolerate spiciness) and then end off the meal with a traditional south indian filter coffee.
Listen, these bagels are good...very good, but they didn't blow me away. In fact, I thought the "everything" bagel and the garlic bagels were downright disgusting. No, like inedible disgusting. The best ones were the basic, plain ones (for me). 

Anyway, it was a fun place to go to and pick up a snack. Not a great place to get drinks to go with the snack, since they only seem to sell whole cartons of juice. 

Glad I tried it, would try it again, but probably wouldn't go out of my way to do so. 

BUT that's me...people seem to be die hard Montreal bagel fans and if that's you, I think you hold this place in much higher esteem! All the power to ya!
Love. Love. Love.

Growing up in Chicago, I had a plethora of non-chain type bagel joints to choose from. True, legit, REAL bagels... Not those things that Einstein's, Panera, DD and the like, try and pass off as a bagel. Poppy's delivers a great bagel that satisfies all the requirements. Perfect amount of chew, not hard, not dry, not bready, good flavor... Awesome. 

The bagels are great, prices are good, friendly service. I just wish they were closer to the Southend! I can't wait to go back and try their matzoh ball soup!! Yum :)
My husband and I went here for the first time today and it was delicious! I had two veggie dogs: the Louisiana Ave. and Bruschetta dogs. The Louisiana Ave had hot sauce and Cajun cole slaw and it was really hot. Definitely didn't skimp on portions and delicious. Ingredients were fresh and the pesto on the bruschetta dog was delicious and creamy. I also had a vegetarian sloppy joe and that was eh but we were really there for the dogs. Definitely go and give it a try. The guy there was super nice, too.
I wasn't feeling like eating a huge meal when I came here, so I just had the yogurt with fresh fruit.  The service was good, and this place is open late night, so I'm sure I'll visit again since I go downtown a lot.
Nice friendly people.I am a wimp when it comes to spice and I told them that and told me which was the least spicy and it was delectable!!!!!!!!
I really like the atmosphere of the restaurant, everyone was friendly and helpful.  I ordered the shrimp fried rice and I have never been more pleased with a dish.  It wasn't greasy and it was very flavorful.  I will definitely be going back and using them for our next office meeting.
The menus are battered and the new waiter, bless him, had to peer at where I was pointing on the menu to work out what I was asking for when I said "umeboshi" (although maybe that's my quiet voice and poor pronunciation at work) but my, my, that's some good sushi. 

I ordered the umeboshi (waaaaaa!!! PICKLY!), six salmon and cucumber maki, and two red pepper nigiri, which altogether came to £10.50. Because the maki come in sixes, I think the best way to do it is to go in a group and order a bunch of stuff between you rather than just get one type each.

The umeboshi were super-pickled in that face-twistingly sour way - yum! The nigiri and maki were spot on - fresh-tasting, good cohesive rice, sweet and filling. I loved the weeny wasabi rolled into a little teensy blob-ball on the side of my nigiri. Too cute! That little green globe is going to be all I can think of when I hear the words "wasabi pea" from now on.

Being technical, I really should give this place three stars, because it's A-OK and I had a fine time here - but it gets a fourth star mostly for the gorgeous manga on the wall. Also, the benches are comfy to sit on.
We stopped by the Herb Box for an early dinner and I was eager to try this healthy spot.  At around 5:30pm, the place was pretty empty.  We were seated outside and checked out the menu and happy hour specials before deciding on Stella (1st choice listed on happy hour menu was OUT?!?!), a chardonnay, and the hummus plate.  

The hummus plate was amazing, but one of my pet peeves is a large amount of hummus and clearly not enough pitas.  I don't like to feel like a pig when I want more pitas to go with the half of my hummus that's still left.  Oh well.  

We moved on to the BLT flat bread pizza and my Grow Happy salad.  The Grow Happy salad was delicious and a perfect dinner size.  The BF liked the BLT flat bread pizza, which had a cesear salad on top, especially because it was something different.

Now, the not so good part.  The service.  Sloooooow.  Awkwardly, disappointingly slow.  And it wasn't at all busy!  

Can't say we'll be back, since we aren't up in that area a lot.  Maybe I'll have to try the other location.
Everytime I visit Dibellas I have a flawless experience. No matter what time of day, how busy, who's working, I always get great service and great food. My go to sub is the God Father, hot, on white bread with lettuce tomatoes provolone cheese and oil.. and of course that chocolate chip cookie.  When you walk in you're facing a long dining area\/ordering line, which can be a little concerning when it's jammed with people and the lines out the door, but their staff is prompt and efficient, and although sometimes they lack the personality to go with their great service, I'd rather have quick, quality food than a chatty, overly friendly employee- after all, that's not what's going to satisfy my hunger.  And besides, when you're working on getting people in and out and concentrating on orders with no end in sight, I'd say it's expected to feel a little less chatty, and I'm ok with that! Continue to deliver quick service and great food, and I'll continue coming back.
Best gyro I have had in the valley. Can't wait to go back and check out their lamb, shawarma, and falafels!
Damn your location and classy inviting decor which made me think I was in for a burger delight.  

It's so easy to walk by m:burger after going to Branthouse or another lounge and think to yourself, "this place must have great burgers".  This is one of those few times you SHOULD NOT listen to your inner self. 

The burgers are super boring, super expensive, the bread sucks and it comes with few toppings if you just order the burger, topping are extra.  Yes, they have the $100 burger (I don't know who's tried it), but even $10 for their "AAA" burger is beyond reason because the burger it self just isn't good.  Add soem toppings and you're looking at $15 for your below average meal.
This place is okay, as far as bar food goes. Lots of TVs, OTB and juke box. For happy hour, we ordered Jake's boneless wings and 1 dozen GOAT wings. The boneless wings were dry as toast. GOAT wings were pretty decent. 

Wait staff courteous and prompt.
Vendredi soir, je suis avec mon ami qui habite à proximité et qui est un habitué du Philémon. J'étais sceptique à l'idée d'aller dans un bar du vieux port sans talon haut et sans être sur mon 36. Mais bref, vu que j'étais avec un habitué je me suis dit d'accord j'y vais pour un verre...4 verres plus tard, ma soirée à fini à la fermeture. Le staff est super gentil, autant des bouncers qui se pensent pas au dessus de toi, que les barmaid et la fille du coatcheck. En passant, tout le monde du staff est bien classy. Le seul verre que j'ai payé, je m'attendais à le payer 10 ou +. Mais non un beau gros 7$ + tx et surprise, il goûtait l'alcool généreusement. J'ai pris un rhum 7up (Désolé je suis plate question cocktail) L'endroit était bien rempli et la musique super bonne. J'ai ecouté du rock n roll, comme des classiques, des toutes de la compagnie créole, samba, Magic system, de la musique populaire du moment et plus. La place est bien rempli par contre pas de place pour s'assoir et on s'entend qu'il n'y a pas de piste de dance...on créé notre propre piste. Bref, belle découverte du vieux. Ah oui, les toilettes sont propres et il y en plus qu'une!!
Beer! Free parking! Great place to have some good brew. Great bar food.
This is a regular spot for us and I've never reviewed it so here we go! Looking for soup dumplings on a budget that is comparable to another local fav: Ding Tai Fung? This is it. Okay, it's not the same BUT it's worth it! You will be satisfied with their soup dumplings. Note you do not come here expecting great service. Most staff don't speak English or even Cantonese well, best to come with a Mandarin speaking person. We also love the pan fried dumplings, rice cakes and mapo tofu - really nice flavour and just enough of that numbing spice. Quick service but like I said, don't expect typical north American customer service because you will be disappointed.
This was my first time here and i was a bit hesitant but that quickly flew out the window. It was great the food was amazing the service was excellent our waiter was funny and made sure that we were good with everything. I didn't even know Brew Garden was there and I'm so happy to have gone I assure you that I will return.
For the past decade, I've wanted a tattoo. The only problem was, everything I thought of, I didn't think I'd want years down the road. I love accessories, but I'm pretty picky about anything permanent. Last year, I finally decided, and had a friend draw up some sketches around my idea. The result was something I couldn't *not* get inked. And when I started asking around, everyone pointed me to Heather at Lady Luck. 

Heather has a quaint little shop in Braggs Pie Factory. Heather has a pink glittery art piece of a unicorn. I was in love with it. She was in love with my tattoo. It was a match made in heaven. 

I worked with Heather for about 4 months before the big day. I showed her my sketch. We discussed the procedure and prices. I had the sketch stenciled on me in at least two different places so I could try out places before the day came. I called her. I emailed her. I asked her a million paranoid questions. I was sure she'd be annoyed with me by the time the day came. 

I went in, and Heather had a TV set up for while I was there and a stand that I could easily set my water and phone on. I brought a few movies of my own and my ipod, but I didn't even use them. We ended up watching one of her movie and laughing and talking about it the whole time. She finished the piece in nearly no time at all, which pretty much takes up the front part of the top of my left arm, but is only in black and white in a little over an hour. And only the bottom of Dot's dress hurt, and even that pain was tolerable. I was surprised. I had completely planned on freaking out and ending up with a toe or something and that's it. Instead, I walked out with the most gorgeous thing I could imagine, an appointment for a tiny touch up a few months later, and great instructions on how to care for it. 

And still I called a few more times, unsure if what I was experiencing was normal. And no one yelled at me or became annoyed (at least to my face). And the touchup was free. 

Here I am about 8 months later, with a tattoo that to this day, gets way too much attention. But hey, that's part of the reason you get one right? Everyone loves Dot. And I love telling the story of how quick and painless it was and referring everyone that wants a great inking experience to head to Heather. 

I'm not sure I could ever pick a better piece than Dot, but if I decide to get a second, this is where I'll head.
How have I never reviewed FilmBar? This is exactly the kind of place Phoenix had needed for ages and the type of theater I craved. See, I don't really like big box anything (stores, restaurants, etc). And this even includes theaters. I also don't really care for most major motion pictures either. About 1 every year interests me enough to pay a bajillion dollars and sit with 10 million other people.

See. I don't just like FilmBar for the beverages. That's only a bonus. I love it for the small awesome non chain theater it is. And for the great movies it offers. And for the fact that you don't have to go in to enjoy a movie. You could go in just for the bar.

The staff is super friendly. Gift certificates are available. I believe you get a free movie on your birthday. It's pretty super rad!!

I see so much potential: screening major sporting events and other events, more quirky documentaries, rock band karaoke using the giant screen. Let's do some of these. Then I'll only love you even more than I already do.
So, they've retooled the menu since they first opened.  Our server told me that my mom and I are the only people who preferred the original menu... I'm not surprised.  Anyhow, there are no longer the different size pours for wine and the central menu item is now a "build your own dinner" idea.  It definitely works, provided you know how to pair fish or meat with sauce and sides.  I've done two different versions (both fish) and they've been pretty freaking fantastic.  The kitchen knows how to cook fish!

Also new since they opened is a HUGE outdoor space, complete with stage area and water features.  Haven't been outside to take advantage yet as it's been PACKED both times I've been since that opened.

Speaking of packed, with the outdoor space, the place is PACKED every evening... Parking can be kinda interesting in the small lot.

All in all, a great addition to the South Hills dining scene.
I've been here several times now, and always have a good experience.  This time was no exception.  The bread is crunchy and tasty and the water constantly filled.  I went with the Margarita pizza, which was big enough to share....others at the table cleaned their plates and were satisfied as well.  

Plus, you can't go wrong with the people watching - some people be crazy in Vegas!
Don't let the name fool ya. Think mex-cowboy inspired breakfast\/brunch dishes. There's definitely no deep down south "soul food" here.

Vibrant ambience and decor with bright wall colors, cowboy\/girl and Native American inspired artwork throughout. A large circular bar sits in the heart of this restaurant and it was slammin, especially for a Sunday afternoon. I was pleasantly surprised by their choice of music - instead of country, they played Motown classics. Seemed a little bizarre for the ambience but I'll take it any day. 
 
It was a busy Sunday afternoon, yet they managed to fit us in with no wait. Our server was outstanding - engaging, attentive, fun and silly to top it off. Food was great. I see why people rave about it. Lemon ricotta pancakes lived up to the reviews. Triple play daily special consisted of three tortilla cups with eggs and different bean\/salsa\/chili fillings. Each had a unique flavor and each was a little spicy and delicious. Make sure you try the jalapeño bacon! Several kids meal options available. The one we ordered had eggs and ham, came with rainbow potatoes, and was a great portion. 

Not the "soul food" I'm used to but still a great experience, fun environment, with unique dishes.
I have to agree with another Yelper that this is one of the only clubs I like in Scottsdale. Ended up here randomly one night while a few friends and I were in the area and low and behold. LIVE MUSIC!!!!! You can't get much better than live music. 

Drinks are a little overpriced and I've seen the cover occasionally be rather high, which is typical of Scottsdale, but still not fun for me. 

The dance floor is fairly decent sized and people actually dance. I've seen Saturday nights get a little packed but there still seems to be plenty of room to see the band and dance. There are other areas separated from the stage and dance floor if you just want to relax. I highly recommend the outside patio for that, which is wonderful! 

The crowd isn't so bad either. It's actually pretty tolerable. Way to go Martini Ranch!
Came here for a casual dinner. I had the rare beef pho and a side of spring rolls here. The price is pretty cheap and the portion is decent (slightly on the large side).  The pho is average, I found that it wasn't as chewy as I'd like it.  The broth was flavourful.  The spring rolls were very crispy and fresh and were only $2.50! Overall the food tasted decent, however, I got a stomach ache after and I'm not sure if it was caused by raw the bean sprouts, or something in the pho.
My spa life has been changed forever - by my husband.
Its hard to find spas that have enough common co-ed space where you can cuddle and relax and enjoy time together. After all it is Vegas and a little couple time away outside your hotel room can feel, taboo. I mean its Vegas sand to the beach blah blah blah. This is one of the few places I think couples get a fantastic retreat.

There is a coed lounge with many couches where you can sit and relax and prep before your appointment or use the salt and stone rooms together. I loved the salt room - I fell asleep in a trance with headphones on. Don't try to adjust the chaises, they are fixed in position. I love the Japanese rock beds, we have them in San Mateo and they are great - but I think that for people who haven't experienced them, a little instruction maybe on the door, or by the staff could prevent people from using them wrong.

The steam room was nice, large and so was the sauna. There are icy face towels nearby. The jacuzzi and dipping pools were nice, but the large balcony jacuzzi overlooking Vegas and the pool party below was a highlight. Its coed and the men come from the other side and the jacuzzi has an infinity edge and its maybe 20' long. There are a few lounge chairs but this was nice. 

The day pass is a steal for all of the above plus gym (I got enough exercise dancing all night so I didn't try it), refreshments and fruit.

The vanity area is nice and comfy but I wish they had more than one hairdryer\/flatiron. You might want to bring yours.

I went with my girlfriends and a BIG plus is they have private lounge areas available if you are having a bachelorette\/birthday party! I know bachelorette parties can turn a calm spa into a chicken coop and this option makes this spa stand out!

So yeah - you can bring your boo to the spa. Or your gaggle of friends, or your new Vegas hookup...
Nice place to take the kids price isn't too bad. Worth getting an annual pass for $40 adult and $25 for children
Wow the food its absolutely yummy! We have no idea what kind of food they serve since they're a Veggie Restaurant but what we ordered was great, no issues or complaints at all, they even had someone speaking in spanish so make it all much better.
Mahi Mahi was good, wouldn't say spectacular. Broccoli was tasty. I kind of expected it to be a bit better. The Bread cake was a solid dessert. Vegas has so many great choices that it can take a lot to stand out especially in the seafood and steak category.
Overall, fancy Italian in South End with high prices but underwhelming food. 

Valet - check
White tablecloths - check 
Extensive wine list - check
Pricey entrees - check
Flavorful, quality food - ... 

I was very underwhelmed with the food, especially considering how high the prices were. I had the gnocchi ($18), wedge salad, and tried the veal osso bucco ($29). Given the high reviews and prices, I expected the food to be better. It was all fine, but we could have gotten a better meal for half the price that I would have been happier with elsewhere. 

Save this place for date nights where food isn't the highlight of the evening.
Had a great Christmas Eve family dinner at Braddocks. The appetizers were  to die for including Braised pork Pierogies (this was my favorite), Kielbasa (large charcuterie style ) and stuffed sausage. All were some of the best apps I've ever had to be honest. I had a pretty good filet mignon as we'll but next time I will try something less generic. Great service and atmosphere in the renaissance hotel.
I've visited this place on and off since the late 80s.

The food has always been great!

The bar is owned by a family from Wisconsin and the food menu reflects that. You'll find plenty of brats and cheeses and their walleye is excellent.
It's definitely delicious but way too sweet for my tastes! I suggest you share a plate because that sugar is going to hit you real quick! But definitely go with a group so everyone can share!
Since my original review I have gone back another few times AND been to Italy. When I went to Italy I was expecting all of the food to be as good as, if not better than what I had at Alegno. Well, if we were lucky, it was as good. Which means I'm guessing this as good as it gets! The food truly is exceptional! 

We went again last weekend and ordered the special, which was amazing as always. We were very hungry, but they gave us two baskets of bread, no problem. One of the nicest things was that I ordered amaretto and ginerale. They brought them out separately and I had to add them together, but they kept bringing me refills of my ginerale. By the end my drink obviously had no more alcohol, but I thought it was so nice that they felt they should refill my drink all the same. 

It's a small place and entirely family run, so the service is sometimes slow and they will sometimes run out of specials, because I guess they make only so many\/night, but that just proves the family-run business atmosphere and the homemade food. It doesn't get better!
Yes yes and yes, open late, pizza was piping hot and super delicious @ 3:30am, possibly the best place to eat in the Cosmo
I've been to this casino a total of 4 times since it opened a few weeks ago... shame on me! Not my favorite casino, in fact, my least favorite casino that I've ever been to.

The positives: 
-New building, so of course it's nice

-The memorabilia, while not a lot of it, is pretty cool

-Lively music

The negatives:
-TIGHTEST MACHINES I'VE EVER PLAYED and I've been to Vegas, Atlantic City, Canada, other local casinos (Thistledown, Horseshoe), etc. I obviously don't go into a casino expecting to win huge jackpots because that's unrealistic. However, when you spend a couple hundred dollars, you expect a tiny bit of pay back. Nope, not here. I sat next to a guy who was playing the Family Guy slot (they only have two of these, btw, so good luck getting on one) and he put in $20 8 times, max bet each time, and got nada. Received one bonus round and won $10.00. I'm sorry but that's absurd to me

-The "reward" card is crap. No comps really and we were told that you get money off their tiny, expensive gift shop items. Um... NO THANK YOU!

-The buffet is expensive and had some of the driest chicken, nastiest mac n cheese and fatty pieces of beef - gross! The fact that it was a ghost town in there should have told me something. At $45+ for two people, you expect some decent food. Ironic that the name is, "Fresh Harvest" when it's anything BUT fresh

I tried to give this casino the benefit of the doubt, especially since it's Hard Rock but I'm pretty sure tonight was my last visit. I'm not going to drive 20 minutes out of my way for a nice building but crappy everything else.
Compared to other buffets in Vegas, Bacchanal ranks at the top. I haven't tried the Wynn or Wicked Spoon yet though so I can't compare it to those but I venture to say they are all pretty much on par with each other. What I will say is that Bacchanal is definitely worth a visit. 

The tough part about any buffet is keeping food fresh and hot - just naturally stuff will cool down if sitting out. Overall, there are some hits and some misses, but it's great to try a lil of everything. The modest portions allow for that. Desserts were great - wonderful selection. Plus, honestly, I just had fun eating here! You can't say that about all buffets. The interior is nicely decorated and there is a lot to see as you walk around the buffet.

If you get the Buffet of Buffet pass, this is an extra $15 per visit. It already went up from $10 when it first opened. But on it's own, prices are not crazy - ranges from about $17ish for breakfast to $37ish for dinner. Get the free Total Rewards card for a discount. 

I think Vegas and buffets are like Vegas and slot machines, Vegas and showgirls, Vegas and Cirque - it's a match made in heaven. So buffets are a must-do and if you're gonna do, then do Bacchanal!
Where else can you have pho for breakfast?! Maybe not the best in town but great when I want soup for breakfast. Service is so-so but pho for breakfast!!
We've never been disappointed with anything at Heart and Soul,  but its the Bacon Bloody Marys that keep us coming back - all the way from Salt Lake City! The service is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing.  A great place to gather with friends!
I can't believe we've lived in Pittsburgh for over 3 years and haven't experienced the Gateway Clipper before now.  I think it must be one of those local treasures that you take for granted when it's so readily available to you, but I can assure you that we won't be taking it for granted anymore! We chose to do the dinner cruise with another couple who was visiting from TX and wanted to "see Pittsburgh", so we thought this might be a great experience for all of us, and we certainly weren't disappointed! Awesome time for locals and visitors alike, and I highly recommend it! The staff and crew were extremely accomodating, and the food was surprisingly very good! Truthfully, I wasn't expecting much, but we were so full by the time we finished that we couldn't even consider desert.. and that's a pretty big deal! ;)  our buffet dinner consisted of grilled chicken and breaded pork, mashed potatoes and gravy, macaroni salad, steamed veggies, and side salad. The drinks were super tasty (maybe a little too tasty, if you get my drift!), and the appetizers we ordered (crab & lobster dip and an anti pasto) were, again, surprisingly really delicious! All of the drinks, both alcoholic and non, come in a take home souvenir glass which is a really nice touch. 

Before dinner, the captain gives a quick history and a few facts about some of the major landmarks along the rivers, and you're able to take your drinks outside and enjoy the view from the upper deck where there are tables and chairs. After dinner, there is a dj and a dance floor that open up and he plays music for the remainder of the cruise (and he takes requests!).  We all chose to stay outside and enjoy the weather and scenery, and honestly I wouldn't have done it any other way!  Our 2 and a half hours were well spent, and it's most definitely an outing that we will be taking again!  

(The 4 stars come from just a couple minor details. One being the decor.. it seems as though the interior of the ships haven't been updated in a VERY long time, and that might be something that some would find bothersome. I'll admit I noticed it, but it certainly didn't affect our opinion or moods.  The bathrooms are VERY small, but they are located on all 3 levels.  I also wish there was a little more outside seating. We were totally fine, but I noticed quite a few elderly couples who were left standing because of the seating situation.. and shame on the younger people for not giving up their seats..just saying.  Just some small observations that I thought may be worth mentioning!  Nothing that would ever be reason enough not to do this again!)
ABOVE ALL IS STILL OPEN! It did not close it moved west about two blocks. It is now on the south side of the street. I forget the number but it's about 650. I was in there today and found just the part I was looking for.
I really had never even considered eating here, but the group I was eating with chose it because they were able to accommodate a table of 30. That actually was impressive since it was Friday night of a fight weekend. 

I ordered the hangover omelet. It is made with bacon, fries and mushrooms. I substituted ham for the mushrooms. I hate mushrooms. The food was rather bland. I quickly asked for hot sauce. Even Cholula could not save it. It was not bad. It just liked any significant flavor. The portion was significant and it comes with your choice of fries. I chose the waffle fries. They were OK. 

Our service was as good as can be expected for a group of this size. They were all friendly, and did their best to keep up.  This is the reason they are getting three stars instead of two.

They would not divide up the bill at all. Only one bill per table. That was a giant pain. It took forever to work through a bill for over 30 people. I hate all the excuses restaurants use to justify not dividing bills. You are in a service industry. Figure it out.
This chipotle has the best customer service.  Food is always super fresh and tastes delicious. Best location!!
I was going to give this place 3 stars and tell you about the Las Vegas sushi burrito and the Tokyo sushi burrito that I tried, but I went back the next day to try their ramen I was not happy with what I was looking at. As I was getting ready to order I was looking in the soda cooler out in the customer area and I noticed that there was raw chicken being stored in the soda cooler. The public had access to the chicken they would be serving to customers. That is unacceptable. No review for you!
I have had a horrible experience with WHASN. I went in for a concern over my period, and the doctor ran multiple STD panels without asking me when nothing had changed from my last STD panel from my annual. There was literally no chance that I had an STD and I was not told these would be ran. My insurance didn't cover a few of these unnecessary panels & WHASN tried to charge me for them.

I called to dispute the charge starting in early September, and I was told only the office manager could help me. Over 12 phone calls and 2 months later, I still haven't been contacted by the office manager. Today I called immediately when they opened, and was told the office manager would get back to me today. I called again around 11 and was reassured I would be called before she left at 3. When I still didn't receive a call at 2:30, I called again and was told the office manager already left for the day. I am at my wits end. They are just trying to get money out of me and are avoiding me at all costs.  

I would never recommend this OBGYN to anybody. From the lack of communication in what tests they were going to run on me, to the lack of communication in my dispute, I wouldn't trust this OBGYN with any of your health or financial matters.
Popped in here for a quick morning coffee and was completely charmed by the interior. What a beautiful place! I wish I had the time to sit and sip my latte because the cafe is just gorgeous. Latte was perfection and the bluberry scone was no less. Would definitely recommend and am desperate to go back!
My fourth time here, and I must say the pizza is good. Not NY pizza, but good.  Yes, born and raised NYer, half Italian (my Mom) ha! ;)
The best is that everything ingredient is FRESH and extremely good ingredients. They don't carry fresh crushed red pepper, but they have an oil chili which has a wonderful kick! 
Now, the broccoli rabe AMAZING it's sautéed in the chili oil. By the way 800, White Castle and other places provide a local discount...
30 choix de sandwichs.. 7" 3.25$ et le 10" 3.75$ +tx... Que dire de plus c'est bon!! Ils ont des sushis préfait...mais pas super...cependant ils ne sont pas chet ey ça depanne!
I have had this on my list for some time, so glad to finally try it. It was really good and you definitely get a great deal here. We ordered a couple of platters including the 100 pieces of sushi, sashimi, and rolls (which was only $58) along with the 80 pieces of assorted rolls (which was only $42). They are always busy and it took about 1.5 hours for our large order. It is more of a take out restaurant than a sit down place. We found the sashimi fresh and it was a nice variety from the usuals like salmon, tuna, octopus along with scallop, squid, and few other fish. The rolls were good, the rice was seasoned nicely and there was not too much rice on the rolls.
This course is not maintained at all. The green are torn up, so expect your putts to be redirected by burnt up grass spots and large divots. That being said, if you want to go smack the ball around on some fairly wide fairways for $13 a round (18 holes), this is the place. That price includes the cart. You spend more than that at a driving range. You can't find a cheaper place around to practice at.
High-end dining with a healthy spin that doesn't sacrifice flavor or quality.

My friend and I dined here during happy hour on a Friday evening.  This spot gets drastically busier around 6 pm.

Chyna was our server and she was welcoming and kind to us.  I ordered a pineapple Cosmo which came with an extra shaker- easily 2 drinks in 1.  Super dangerous... Also only $8 on hh, normally $12 I believe.

I tried 2 happy hour plates:  grilled chicken skewers with grilled pineapple and shrimp scampi.  I highly recommend the chicken which includes 4 skewers with mainly chicken and pineapple basted in a Hawaiian tropical sauce- loving it!!!!  The shrimp scampi was only ok ok flavor for me but was atop a bruschetta to absorb the sauce.

We ran out of time to order dessert though the mini indulgences are outstanding!

I like counting my calories and staying within 1300-1500 a day and seasons makes this possible while having a social life.  All the calories are printed on the menu and they rotate menus seasonally.

*The main reason for my 5 star review is the integrity of the employees. I left my Jimmy Choo sunglasses in the booth and Jen the manager, kept them aside for me when I called 10 minutes after leaving.  The hostess Kim also helped my friend charge her phone on a separate occasion.   

As a boutique manager in the mall, I will be sending my customers to Seasons 52!
I like the vibe here. Coffee shops are popping up all over the valley and it seems like Phoenicians are starting to use them as unofficial offices. I saw plenty of laptops set up looking like they are there for the long haul and people having meetings. There's definitely plenty of outlets to charge all the electronics. 
This place is filled with the smell of good coffee, they also serve breakfast & lunch items. 
Seems like there are quite a few regulars here too.
Restaurant screwed up entire takeout order. Asked for no condiments and no pickles. Both came on the burger. Ordered (and paid) for onion rings; got fries. Asked for ranch and sauce on the side, didn't get them. Called the restaurant to confirm order was the sent in correctly. It was. Manager told me they messed up but he wouldn't offer anything for the screw up. In short, entire burger was ruined, I paid for items I didn't get, and spent over $50.00 for food I couldn't eat. The restaurants response was basically, "Oh that order would require more than the absolute minimal effort, and brain power beyond that which we employ here."

Also, the food is mediocre at best.
Wow quality has gone down compare to the last time I was here. I got the spicy dipped ramen and the soup base was extremely salty, like MSG SALTY. Also it was not spicy at all! I tried to add the spicy flakes and it did nothing to the soup. When I inquired with the waitress, she did nothing and told me the soup is supposed to be salty... I understand that the ramen might be more saltier than others, but this was so salty to the point it was inedible. I ended up not eating and she still charged me full price for it, without offering to even add water so the broth is less salty. 

Also, the egg was hard boiled, not the ones with soft yolk. I asked the waitress and she told me the egg is supposed to be hard boiled for Japanese ramen..... So I don't know..... Have I been eating ramen wrong for my entire life??

The service was really bad this time. They gave my table the bill when I didn't ask for it. It felt like they were rushing us and there was no one waiting for tables. 

Conclusion: will never return.
Give it a 5 for ambition.  The rest falls somewhere below that.  Lots of interesting ideas.  Unique preparations.  But...the food falls just a little short.  

Do I love any place that tries new things? (Pop rocks in sushi, buzz buttons and dry ice with drinks) Yes.  Did those things turn out as amazing as I'd hoped?  No.  

Originally started reviewing this as a 3 overall and then realized I was reminiscing about all the really fun things and 3 was too low. 

This seems like it would be an amazing happy hour hangout.  The drinks, while not out of this world, were fun and innovative.  I had a sake boat (which was like an irish car bomb but with sake and bud light) that sort of missed the mark with the crappy beer.  I'm thinking next time maybe Sapporo?  I had a drink with a buzz button, "Szechuan Buzz" (little saliva-inducing edible flower that makes your mouth feel like it's "buzzing") and one with dry ice that I can't remember the name of (always a fun effect).  But none of the drinks I ordered were actually good drinks.  They were just...fun.  Novel.  A friend ordered a bourbon drink "Yuzu Spice" that was a bit strong for her, but I tried it and it was actually the best drink we ordered.

The appetizers (steer clear of the bok choy, which came to the table a bit gritty and had to be taken off the bill) ranged from good to great, with the Ki King Broccoli being hands down the best, and the Chee Chee Fried Brussels Sprouts giving my Pittsburgh favorites a run for their money.  The shishito peppers underwhelmed, the bonito flakes sometimes gave them a fishy taste that was offputting and the peppers were on the mild side.  The Jicama Spring Roll seemed bland, but I also didn't dip it in anything.  

The Ki King broccoli and Chee Chee fried bussels sprouts deserve another mention.  The broccoli was completely different than  any preparation I'd had before and it was amazing.  I'd have ordered more.  I'd have eaten it all night.  It's that good.  The brussels sprouts too...it seems like everyone is on board the brussels sprouts express right now, but these were as good as any place in the city...and I've tried a LOT of brussels sprouts. 

We didn't actually order the entrees, but got a little sushi.  I ordered the roll with pop rocks, and initial bites were a little..."off".  I got a really strong candy taste in the first one, and it was sort of jarring.  I think it was just a bad bite though, the rest was really good, although the pop rocks themselves weren't really contributing much to the overall taste.  The Poke Aloha was great.  I'd recommend steering clear of the Pop Rocks and trying that (unless you, like me, need the new experience.  Just to see).  

Service was great.  The waitress was high energy (I think you have to be, the place was loud and busy).  

Atmosphere was great...if you like loud and high energy.  

Great place for happy hour\/bachelor party\/groups...not great for fine dining\/date night.

Next time I'll try the entrees and skip the specialty drink menu.
Cacao 70 is perfect when you're craving a sweet treat. Their menu is pretty standard and you'll be pleased with most of it. I wouldn't say it's the type of dessert you dream of indulging into but it hits the spot. 

My warning is go in wanting to spend some quality time with someone because the service is so slow. They usually have 2 people waiting their big restaurant on busy nights and they really struggle to keep up. 

My favourites are their strawberry shortcake and their banana split!
Gorgeous venue (as one can see by the staircase) and perfect layout for performances.  Attended Billy Idol, Willie Nelson and others at this venue and never a disappointment.
No longer in business but the website is still up and available. Unless they moved, the address listed here is not the current address.
Unless you have no other options, don't come here. The place looks old and dirty and the food is NOT good. I had the taco salad which was basically iceberg lettuce, canned olives, dried shredded chicken and one scoop of guacamole and sour cream. Ick! I rather go across the street to the 711 and grab a bag of chips and beef jerky.
I really wanted to give three stars, but I could not get past the lack of wifi in the rooms.  That is inexcusable.

The check-in desk is close to the entrance from the parking garage.  That is not the case at some casinos.  It is convenient.  The check-in process takes far too long for me, but it is right in line with most other casinos.  They all need to get together and figure out a simpler system.

The rooms are OK.  They are average sized.  They are in decent shape.  The bathroom could use an update though.  You have to use a cable for Internet connection which is a shame.  That is not helpful for your iPad.

There are several fast food options on site which is convenient late at night.  It could use some more sit down options though.  The cigar lounge is a great place to relax while enjoying a good cigar and drink.

The pool area is OK.  The lazy river is a good idea, but you cannot drink while floating in it, so the cool factor goes away quickly.

Overall this place is OK for the price.  It is close to hot spots in Aria and Cosmopolitan.
So we knew something was wrong with our 2005 Suburban, something electrical.  We took it to a parts shop and asked them to do a test on the alternator and they come back with a bad test.  They offer to sell us another one and recommended that we go to this Goodyear shop across the street to have it installed.
So we head over there and ask them to quote us and take our truck in.  Decent estimate, so we left it there.  About 1\/2hr later the guys from Goodyear call us back and they tell us that the cables to the battery were kind of loose and that it didn't need a new alternator.  Told us they would only charge a minimal shop fee for looking at it, and told us to return the alternator.  Saved us a couple hundred bucks, because they were honest.  That is an extremely hard trait to find in a Mechanic shop.  Needless to say they have all my business from now on for all of my vehicles.
A lot of the Yelp reviews seemed to center around poor or slow service, so I sat at the bar to up my chances of getting good service.  I had a very friendly waitress who let me try 2 of their beers, since the number of choices is a little overwhelming.  The menu is pretty small and all burgers (no wraps, no salads, no appetizers), but it also works in your favor because the food arrives quickly.  I got the All-American burger with pepper jack cheese & fries.  The food is competently prepared, but nothing to get excited about.  However, if you are looking for some beer & a decent meal for less than $10, this might be your place.
My typical cheap Chinese place is no more and when I remembered I had this flier on my fridge today and was in dire need of some comfort couch food, I reached out to them for help.

They did not disappoint. The take out menu they have is so simple and well organized it's unbelievable. I was told it would be 35 minutes which is reasonable. Imagine my excitement when they arrived in 18!! On top of that my food was very well packaged and organized. 

The garlic chicken isn't as spicy as I was hoping for but was still good and a perfect portion. The wonton soup was delicious too and more than I could eat. The steamed pork dumpling appetizer which is usually fool proof was just okay.

We'll see how many "after affects" I have. The big down side I saw so far as the $12 min order. I had to order 3 items for my lowly self and only finished one.

Oh yeah, and this is my 100th review yay :)
I enjoy having breakfast here once in a while. They have plenty of healthy options. I usually go for the vegan pancakes with carrots, pecans, and agave syrup, along with the veggie hash with egg whites. The veggie hash is served in a skillet. Both are excellent. I also like the MTO break feast with egg whites, chicken sausage, turkey bacon, potatoes, and whole wheat toast. You definitely won't be disappointed with your meal.

The only complaint I have is the patio tables. I would enjoy dining on the patio, but most of the tables are wobbly and ready to topple over as soon as you place something on them. I am shocked that the manager would allow customers to sit at those tables. That issue needs to be addressed a.s.a.p.
We had Gaylord cater our wedding reception.  The staff was friendly and helpful, though they were especially good with setup and tear down.   The food was above average for a catering.  In particular their stuffed Portobello Mushroom was quite nice. We also got some relatively healthy and tasty potato and vegetable dishes.   They were also priced quite reasonably for what we got.

A good experience all around with no major negatives.  I would consider Gaylord for catering again.
Went to Richmond Station with some girlfriends in June. I was really excited to try it out as I had heard good things about the restaurant, and more importantly I was a huge fan of Carl Heinrich on Top Chef Canada!

The waitress was very helpful in assisting us with the wine menu, she even brought us a couple of tastes to help us decide! We ended up with a delicious and well priced Sauvignon Blanc which complimented our food very well. 

The food I thought was a bit over priced, hence the 4\/5 stars. I had the Station burger which Carl is said to have brought over from Marben when he worked there. The burger was basically perfect, medium rare with a soft and not-too-big milk bun. I was very pleased that they accommodated my picky side and gave me half fries half salad as well (PS why don't more restaurants offer this straight up?)

One of my friends got 2 salads as her main, a nice option but she left feeling hungry. I will be back as there are some other items I would love to try. As far as execution and service goes, they were spot on.
lets see. where to begin.... i have a 2016 honda fit and i have spent over $60 on past oil changes but this time i just wanted to get the basic. I had a coupon for 19.99 and i wanted to use it. The first gentleman who greeted me took my info etc. when I told them what i wanted -again what they advertise and he was very persistent that thats not okay for the car and i have to sign a waiver and so on and so on. Then he said "okay im going to give youvsynthetic oil and a $15 coupon which brings the total to $40. Again i said no. I thought that was the end of it...

I go back to the waiting area. Mind you theres nobody else there... Zac the manager comes in and says "my assistant said you only want the basic and i want to warn you..." seriously!? i said please im fine. He gave me attitude about it. Not normal attitude and then slammed the door. i was honestly blown away and called my husband shaking. In the end they didnt charge me the $26. The assistant walked me out to tell me this. And its the only reason i gave one star. While im thankful for the free oil change its not worth my blood pressure going up like that right before i move. A lot of these chains advertise one thibg and then try to upsell you on the spot. I had just never experienced something quite like this.

Update. After 300 miles of driving I just received a notification that my oil life is 15 percent. Even though they put a sticker on my car saying service isn't due for 5,000 more miles. My husband and I are pulling over to add oil. I AM BLOWN AWAY these guys would put customers in harms way knowing I was driving across the United States. Beware!
Stopped in here ..have not been in 4 years.. Really a nice decorated place .. Food was good .. Two of my party had hamburgers and loved them.. juicy, cheesey and fresh. One had Manicotti. she said it was good and it was a vegetarian offering. I had the Manzo Beef sandwich, pretty good sliced steak with cheese and peppers but was a little dry till the waitress brought the aujus..By the way April the waitress was absolutely one of the best servers ever !
Tip for the business. TURN YOUR PHONE ON.  We get the disconnected signal every Friday we call. Avoid this location with a ten foot pole.
Favorit left me underwhelmed. We came here for Book Club in December and I suffer from a terrible affliction of being unable to resist ordering food if the possibility of doing so is raised, so order I did. It seemed a good opportunity at the very least to continue my search for Edinburgh's Greatest Eggs Benedict.

Well, that plan got scuppered pretty quickly when the waiter returned saying that they'd run out of Benedict Sauce. This told me two things: they don't make it fresh, and they don't know what it's called... so I am slightly glad I didn't experiment...

Anyway, I plumped instead for a salmon and cream cheese bagel and a pot of tea. The bagel was just fine. I could have bought the ingredients and made one for myself just as well for about a third of the price, but it was tasty and the bagel bread was nice and sweet, as it should be, with cheese squidging out of the centre hole. No criticisms there really.

The teapot, however, was badly chipped and stained right on the pouring edge of the spout. Being a timid Brit, I grinned and bore it, but it was pretty offputting.

Favorit's a diner-style caff, and it made a decent enough venue for our reduced numbers at Book Club, but it's nothing special. Situated where it is, I'd have thought it'd have to play a better game to get by. Come on, Favorit! I'll definitely come back to see if they're working on it!
4.5 Stars.

Pretty much loved the Vdara. We were here for 3 nights

I thought the $30 early check in fee was a bit over the top but oh well.

The location is more or less perfect. Right next to Aria tucked behind Cosmo (short 5 min walk), connected by tram to crystals, bellagio and monte carlo, you betcha.

Our room, Executive Corner Suite. Super clean, A\/C broken callled service line, fixed in 20 minutes! Amazing service here. Room was sweet, great view of strip, nice extra 1\/2 bath for our guests, full kitchen. We honestly saved a lot of money stying here as we stocked our full kitchen and ate breakfast and lunch daily pretty much.

Our house attendant was awesome, again just really great service. 

The pool is nice and the Market Cafe was very convenient, great prices there too especially on sparkling.

I'm looking forward to our next visit
The best!
Dr Claus is a fantastic vet! The staff are quick and knowledgable in what they are doing!

I feel some places are like used cars dealerships, but this medical centre isn't one of those. They always offer you a choice and never pressure you into anything you need.

Recommended already to 6 other people
Quick service. No line. One person there and she was super quick. I'm not sure how one person can service 5 people faster than the 15 they have at the DMV but they do it. Totally worth the service fees.
We were not able to try the food on a Tuesday evenong. After 45 minutes, all we had was water. The waitress was complaining the entire time about being overworked. We will never return, and will strongly advise against eating there.
*sung to the tune of "Hello" by Adele*

Hello? Can you hear me? I'm in Arizona dreaming about eating cheesy pizza.
I want it, so bad but you never called me back...

Hello to pizza patron,
You put me on eternal hold. 
Then leave your phone off of the hook,
I know for sure because I took a look.

then you never came back on the line, or picked up when I called back.
I just don't get it, why would you do me like that?

Hello to pizza patron, I really tried to order by phone... Still you don't answer for me any more. :'(
If you've been to a Red Lobster before then skip my review.  If not, well then, continue on...so we came here for lunch. It's the usual routine:  drinks, biscuits, appetizer then main entree.  We ordered the 3 item sea side sampler which was really delicious. Later our main course arrived.  My date ordered the Ultimate Feast which she enjoyed but couldn't finish. I order the Endless 
Shrimp which in my case ended after the main entree and one additional shrimp plate.  I think it is possible to have too much of a good thing.  And since you can't take it with you, that was the curtain call on lunch. 
I would have given it four stars if our server would have shown up a little more, refilled our drinks sooner, that kind of thing.  But there's always room for improvement.
Got delivery from here several weeks ago.  Pizza was some of the best I've had in ages.  Real pizza, not the stuff that comes from the chains.  (Papa John's, you can offer me whatever discounts you want, that stuff isn't real pizza...)  That said, the pizza was pretty darn pricey.  With a couple of toppings, I seem to recall a pizza being close to $20.  I'd certainly order from Ardolino's again, just bracing myself for a bit of sticker shock...
I was really disappointed in this Westin Hotel, just off the Strip in Las Vegas. 

You would think that Westin, one of the better brands of hotels in the Starwood family, would go all out for their only Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Top shelf to attract both the business travelers who have learned to rely on Westin's level of service, and the casual traveller, who wants a good hotel near the strip. 

They missed on both.

This Westin can't make up its mind between being a business hotel and a Vegas hotel. It has a very small casino, with 1 crap table, a few table games, and some slots, but virtually nobody playing. The crap table never opened. 

And the rooms are small and very much business like, versus Vegas like in size, decor and style. 

And although Westin has only owned this porperty for less than 6 years, it is already showing age around the edges, losing any freshness or swank it might have had at opening. It just doesn't have a crisp feel like many other Westins in major cities have. 

And right now, the city is doing major construction work on this section of Flamingo Road, so getting in and out of here is a hassle. 

If you want a business hotel in Vegas, I suggest you try Embassy Suites on Paradise. And if you want a more resort like hotel that is reasonable, try the Hilton Grand Vacation properties (there are 3 in Vegas). EIther can be had for under $150. OR get those internet deals from the major Casino Hotels, which are offering some great deals. Like the Venetian mid-week for $69, or many others for under $100.

At least I got 1 day of starpoints to add to my Starwood SPG account.
Bon service rapide  ! J'avais pris comme entrée un Wong tong  aux crevettes  avec une sauce à l'arachide et comme plat principal   j'ai un plat à base d'aubergine  .Tout était  bon !
The name says it all! Nearly choked to death on multiple pieces of hair that was cooked to perfection and attached to my mushrooms and onions. But wait, they did take $5.00 off my bill. Glad that me choking and my loss of appetite on New Years Day was worth so much. Not to mention the manager never even stopped by our table to apologize. Used to be a great place for a quiet meal, anymore it has an old stale smell as soon as you walk in, food is very bland no seasoning at all. As you can see in my picture, they slap a big plain baked potato on your plate and don't even cut it or rub some salt on it. Nothing.  Anymore it feels like I'm eating at a nursing home. Waitresses are o.k. Long time customer very dissatisfied with last visit, not planning on returning until some changes are made.
I like everything about Chipotle. I prefer a bowl with easy brown rice, heavy fajita veggies, strained brown beans, chicken, two scoops of strained pico de gallo, and cheese. I can usually only eat half. I chill the rest and eat it later. I can't decide it I like it better hot or cold. I guess I'll have to come back and eat more to figure it out.
Always cool to try new spots and foods you often don't see on every corner. Got the chicken soltado. Pescado w the fish\/shrimp sauce. Both were tasty. Chicken seemed slightly over cooked. Look forward to coming back. Tomatoes in my soltado were good too.
The food I had for lunch here was fine (including the fries, which made me happy as I hate cold\/soggy\/raw fries) and I was nicely offered water as I waited for my friend, but I found it very strange how the waitress had to keep leaving the building.  I guess the restaurant is in the building next door?  Why don't they open up that one for lunch then?  It was really strange, especially since there'd be NO employee in the entire restaurant for long periods of time.  It makes me wonder how often people walk out on their bill.

Also, the parking is nonexistent, and I couldn't tell where I was "allowed" to park in the surrounding mini lots.  I finally just parked on the street and walked in the bright heat.  Not fun.

I don't see myself coming back here unless someone else really wants to go.  I admit I am not a fan of the Roosevelt area\/scene though.
I've never been here for dinner or a meal or anything like that, but I have been here a few times for karaoke. 

The first time I went, it was a little hard to see form the road as the sign was dim but I made it. The place is clean and the staff is nice. They stay on top of the bill and last time split checks with ease :)

No matter how packed the place gets they're always there to make sure your glass stays full. 

When I was DD, I was never charged for my soda or water.. or if I was, someone else put it on theirs.

The karaoke runs fairly smoothly, but the selection of songs is pretty lacking, at least for my taste.
Cycle Pub Las Vegas was a blast! Got a groupon and rented the bike for 11 of us for an afternoon tour. Each bar was more fun than the last. Downtown Las Vegas has changed so much and for the better. We had a wide age range in this group from early 20's to mid 50's and everyone had so much fun! Our driver Tony was knowledgable , friendly and just plain fun! Would recommend this to anyone looking to do something different away from the strip. You won't be disappointed!
We have been there a few times. We love that there is so much to do in one spot. A great place to meet friends and hang out. The only issue I have is that it closes so early on the weekends. We would've loved to have a full adult night out. 

We have yet to experience everything this place has to offer but we had fun in the adult section and plan to use it for our birthday next year!
Really disappointed with this place.

I had heard so many GREAT things and had such high hopes, but i was really let down. I went with 3 other people and so we decided to purchase the VIP tickets ahead of time, which was a good decision seeing as the wait was 2 hours for GA.. so I definitely recommend doing that if you choose to go here. The website makes it sound like there are 6 different attractions (mainly because that's what it says!) but actually, it's just 1 very large, very long walk-through style haunted house, with 6 different themed areas. On top of that, they herd you through like cattle and so you're surrounded by people at all times, in a constant, steady line of traffic- not scary. It also seems extremely understaffed. We would walk through 6 or 7 rooms with no actors in them, just props and loud noises. Then when you did finally come across an actually person, almost everytime they were just standing behind their prop talking to you or would let out a loud scream. We passed 1 chainsaw, no clowns, nobody followed us or got in our faces.. all the things you expect from a really, REALLY good haunted attraction were lacking here. I gave it 2 stars because the walk through was long and the themes were good, but they would've been way better as their own, stand alone haunts, and even if that isn't how they do things, at least staff your attraction appropriately. After you realize the actors are few and far between and you're surrounded by tons of people, the scare effect quickly wears off. Intact, towards the end I was actually thinking to myself that I was ready to be done. I was over it completely. Waste of money and a waste of an evening. We (My hubs and i) were kind of disappointed that we spent $70 on this, but then realized it was way better than the alternative- driving an hour to get there, standing in line for 2 hours, and then driving an hour home.. for that. 

Definitely do not recommend.
I've been to several Loving Huts of the world, and this one is not quite up to par. Output of menu items is terribly inconsistent, and the orders often do not quite match the description - usually lacking vegetables listed. I have ordered the same thing several times, and have received something different on each occasion. My favorite thing about this Loving Hut, is that they carry some desserts from Vegan Treats (based in Bethlehem, PA), however they are typically stale! I don't even think they are worshiping the Supreme Master as devoutly, for the TV is rarely on and the propaganda area is sparse. I do admire the Cult as business model approach and would consider Buddhist-derivitive fascism as a potentially viable idea for future world harmony.
We are excited that we have this great restaurant in Ahwatukee! The catfish was tasty and the portion size was generous. Great variety of spice levels - watch out! ;-) Fun atmosphere to watch the game! We will be back often.
Had a craving for donburi!  So I came in here with my son.  The menu was extensive good chocies between sushi and non sushi items.  We were not that hungry so I ordered one dish to be shared between my son and I.  I felt bad for the waitress and she couldn't help but give us a stare.  Luckily, my son was so charming and loving and funny that by the end of the meal he had totally won her over and I left a tip amount as though we had ordered two entrees.
The only disappointment was of course the donburi.  The donburi I crave for and remember is a donburi from long ago when I was a student at Ann Arbor where they would pile on the rice in a big bowl and pile on top a big pile of gooey mixture of onion, egg, and chicken.  It was soooo good!  I haven't been able to find the remembered donburi anywhere else since then.
I think I need to recreate it in my own kitchen to satisfy not necessarily my stomach but my memory.  Not kidding.
A nice occasional change from the usual brueggers right next door. They are always packed when I go in but the service is always quick and accurate. The employees are usually pretty friendly as well, even when they are busy. No complaints here :)
Needed a little me time and wanted a different scene than my usual. Found this place on yelp and decide to stop by, it didn't disappoint!!! Ordered one of the "horchata chai tea iced" found a space on the grand patio full of plush seating and had a great time reading!! It was perfect
This review only speaks to the amazing milkshakes they serve at The Stand. So delicious and a really cute spot. Nice employees and a drive-thru to boot!
This place is amazing! They have great food and service . I love them beer called "Four Peaks"! All food are just delicious ! And also ,do you know they have a Russian style food? OMG ! You must try it !!! Try this place out!
Make no mistake - this isn't a mexican restaurant, and the menu seemed somewhat random to me.  Anywho.  

My husband and I arrived early to head to the bar for a drink before our reservation.  I ordered a margarita, and loved the extra shaker that went along with it - nice touch!

The group arrived and we headed to the patio, which was made quite warm by the heaters.  We started with one order of the Chorizo Fundido, and were brought two big bowls of chips and salsa to go along with it.  Word on the street was that it was delicious, but as a vegetarian I withheld.  A little while later, we were served some yummy warm tortillas and butter - a nice treat!  

There aren't many vegetarian options.  I was able to ask for the tacos with extra black beans instead of the meat, and our server was extra accommodating.  It came with 3 small tortillas and a plate full of lettuce, guac, beans, tomatoes, and rice.  It was good....but a little pricey for what it was.  

Overall, this was an A-Ok restaurant but our server made it a Yay!  He was friendly and helpful.  He was professional.  He offered, pleasantly, to split checks for our group of 8 and even knew who was together.  Kudos to him!
Place isn't and won't ever have the same taste since they switched owners.
I ventured here on a Sunday so I expected it to be crowded. While the store does look huge on the outside, it doesn't really feel that spacious inside. 

Everything I was looking for was in stock although some of the salad greens didn't look the freshest. The lines were long but every register was open and I only waited about 10 minutes total before I was out of the door. Not too shabby. 

Although I didn't have any, wine samples were available for 10 cents each. I'm sure that could come in handy around the holidays.
This firehouse subs location at the epicenter is great....even though almost all firehouses are great lol. I came here during lunch time, but even though they had a lot of customers, they were still able to get me my sandwich in a timely manner. All the staff were really polite when I walked in and while serving me. 

My turkey bacon ranch sub was amazing and fresh and ready to be taken down. It was too good...ahh the fresh bacon, melted cheese on wheat bread was close to heaven in my mouth lol. All in all, a great experience here and I will definitely come back here!
Dr Lee was recommended to me by a friend after being bothered by some shoulder pain from weight lifting.  It's close to my work and from the reception to Dr Lee it's an overall pleasant experience.  The facility is nice and easy to access, especially if you're working in the financial district.  It was a painful first session but I really needed it after the pain I was experiencing the weeks before.  I went to Physiomed a couple times before and it was the most useless excuse for treatment I have ever received.  No working the shoulder and no relief.  They just kept going over the area with an ultrasound pulsing machine and I paid about $80 for each treament.  
Dr Lee really listened to what was bothering me and worked my shoulder in.  I was sweating bullets in my first session but the same day my shoulder felt good as new.  He also gave me some light exercises to do in my spare time to work my shoulder and even out the muscle.  
Overall a great experience and glad that my shoulder finally feels better.  I would highly recommend this clinic to my friends and family and will return for future treatments.
Tried this place one time shortly after they opened. 

I wasn't really impressed with their food. The place did look neat and clean and the staff was very friendly.

Although I wasn't impressed with my one visit based on the customer service I'll probably try it again at some point.
I have now been here twice in one week and that should be all of the review you need.  The pizza is as good as I have had here in the valley and if you go on a weeknight there is no wait and the service is so fast and friendly there is not one thing to complain about.  I have not gone on the weekend so I cannot say if it gets crowded but the place is pretty small.  

They have a lot of varieties of pizza and calzones as well as salads.  I could probably just be sated from the delicious bread that comes with the dinner salad.  I believe it is just small portions of the pizza dough but I cannot be sure.  But I don't care what it is,  it is delicious. 

This would be a great date place, especially on a chilly night.  The glowing brick pizza oven is right in the middle of the restaurant and just makes a place  that is in the middle of a strip mall seem very cozy.

As the other reviewer mentioned they have a great wine selection, some surprising beer choices and a nice covered patio.  I had been in this complex a few times and never even noticed this place so I am glad that I read Joe's review and took the time to find it.
LOVE their new redesign and renovation!! It looks totally different and WAY classier! It does not look like the stereotypical "asian restaurant". I love it when restaurants\/stores\/companies REINVEST their money into their own businesses because they have pride in their business. This is definitely a company that takes pride in their business.

I always see their employees cleaning or shining utensils. I love shiny utensils! 

Plus they never rush you...even if you come in 20 min before closing. (sorry about that Saigon!)
Excellent pizza.  Normally I'm a thin crust lover but since their specialty is deep dish we ordered it.  Fabulous.  Great atmosphere at the bar and in the dining room.
There isn't much here for vegetarians, but I had their portabello mushroom sandwich and sweet potato fries - both of which I enjoyed.  The waitress was attentive and courteous, and my friend and I were well taken care of.  A lot of reviews talk about breakfast\/brunch...  We went for dinner, but I might return at some point to try other meals.
Dr. Anjum is an extremely well rounded physician.  She's always available, up to date and is a problem solver.  I would never consider changing doctors. Dr. Anjum, as well as her staff are efficient, knowledgeable and caring.   No crazy appointment scheduling at Dr. Anjum's office!  She takes her time, is meticulous about tackling your concerns and provides what is best for you.  Few doctors have the combination of great skill and beside manner- Dr. Anjum has both! She educates you on what is going on, as well as providing material.  She makes it hassle free, but please follow and listen to the doctor:)
WOW - What a beautiful spacious hotel room. I do not think that I can ever go back to another hotel after staying here. I sure was spoiled scoring a room here! Between the amazing decor, soft King size bed, to the TV in the bathroom (that had both a shower and tub) and the sitting\/office area I was in heaven. And the staff couldn't have been more accommodating, helpful and friendly. Now this is how you should feel \/be treated at every hotel. You defiantly feel like you are staying at a resort when you are staying at the Palazzo. 

I also really enjoyed the fitness facility, high end shops, and delicious restaurants that the Palazzo offers. I didn't get a chance to check out the pools, but I am sure they are just as amazing as the rest of the hotel and it's facilities. 

All around an amazing hotel!
I went here, and with the huge 45 minute wait, I was expecting amazing food, What I got was meh food, Our server was on top of the table, but my meal came out a good 10 minutes after my dining partners meal, and while the server was super apologetic, food should never come out so far apart! And to be honest the food I got well, it was just bland, and boring, It was terrible. Maybe its because  I am used to getting authentic Mexican food, but even compared to the tex-mex I get this was sub par. Although you do get a nice portion for the price that you are paying, so there is that.

Long story short, this place is perfect for people with huge appetites, small budgets, and those who care about quantity over quality.In other words a typical college student.  I really wouldn't recommend it for anyone else.
I was there two days ago  I had a rueben sandwich  the sandwich came with French fries steak cheese sauerkraut and it is one of my most enjoyed sandwich although there are many more to enjoy always be a customer favorite
First, let's start with the online ordering: every place should have this capability. Now lets talk food: 
We ordered the chicken fried rice, curried duck, appetizer assortment platter, an order of sticky rice and a Thai iced coffee. Once inside and unpacked, the aroma wafting through my kitchen was nothing short of magical. The Chicken fried rice was for my husband, who has a limited pallet. I'm sure it was delicious, as he didn't complain. The duck curry was fall of the bone good. Just enough spice to cause, as we New Yorkers say, as schvitz. I enjoyed almost everything in the sampler except the egg\/spring roll things. I just didn't care for those. My coffee was\/is delightful. I will absolutely order from here again for several reasons: online ordering convenience, timely delivery, and the AMAZING FOOD!!
after reading reviews on this place, thought I would take my family here to give it a try.

but after driving in circles a few times, we realized that this place had closed down - couldn't find it at all!
Came here for dim sum - it's one of those mark on a sheet to order.

The dim sum here is pretty decent and tasty. It can get a bit pricey, but other reviews say if you come early (before 10:45am) you can get all sizes for the same price. 

Definitely order from the dessert section - they have some pretty unique and tasty options.
Bad customer service, horrible for a 4 diamond hotel. Underneath the trained smiles to pacify you they don't do much to fix anything. Spent A lot of money on a Penthouse loft and the room was horrible, wall paper were peeling off in the bathroom and the carpet was wet. They say someone overflowed the bathtub and flooded the place. At least fix the problem before the next guess. So the apologized and invited me back this year to make up for the problem, great right that is a good move until they check me into an suite that had dog urine on the carpet, and they moved me to a lower floor but took them over a day to move me and did not tell me how long it would take we will call you when its ready, 5 calls and 3 visits to the front desk the room was ready at 3 pm the next day waisted the whole day for these people. Too many incidents to be a 4 Diamonds.... I don't think so
Food was great service was great I highly recommend Takeda Thai.  The edammae was amazing, so was the coconut ice cream!
When deciding where to go to Valentine's Day dinner, we decided to try something a little different and have an "experience" , instead of just dinner. So we made reservations at O. Noir. Overall, it was a good time and a good laugh. 

One recommendation: Maybe don't wear your BEST clothes to this place, as there is a very really possibility that you will drop food on yourself. 

THE WAY IT WORKS: For those of you who don't know - You enter into a lounge with brick walls and dim lights. You pre-order your meal and can order drinks from the bar there. THen you are introduced to your waiter(ess), who is visually impaired, and are led into a pitch black room and seated at your table. 

And it IS pitch black. You can't see your hand in front of your face. Your eyes never adjust and there is a sort of entrance way into the room, so you never even get light from the door when someone enters the room. 

You are then served your food and have to go about the task of trying to eat it, while blind. This is a challenge, because you can't see the food and because even when you THINK you've finally speared a veggie, for example, when you bring the fork to your mouth, you realized you've lost it somewhere along the way. Usually into your lap. 

This is DEFINITELY an experience, does an interesting job at raising awareness, but here are my issues with this place: The food was good, but not great. This becomes more apparent when you can't even see the presentation of the food and are reliant entirely on taste. It needs to taste GREAT. This was distinctly forgettable food. 

I would have liked to see the room we were in at the end of the meal. YES, I know this would require everyone eating at the same time, no new people entering, but I was a little sketched out about never seeing where I was. Basically, you could be in dirty, dank basement storage room and you'd never know! 

Finally, it's very expensive! 

I found that I liked it to try once and say I've done it, but it's gimmicky and that doesn't translate well into a place that will become a go-to favorite. Once is enough for me!
This was our first visit to Pio Pio for a late lunch and had an enjoyable experience! We were greeted by a friendly staff member who promptly seated us in an otherwise empty restaurant....three other diners. 

After perusing the menu, we asked a number of questions and made our decisions. My Bride and I both ordered the rotisserie chicken. She ordered her bird with fries and a side salad.  I ordered the beans & rice, the ripe plantains, fried yuca and tostones.

Our server was patient and informative and made our experience satisfying.

Our chicken was a generous portion of flavorful moist chicken (white meat).  The salad and fries weren't notable nor were the beans and rice. The ripe plantains were flavorful and moist. The fried yuca was bland except for the dipping sauce which could jazz up a hockey puck. The tostones were equally unmemorable except for the dipping sauces.

The staff is welcoming and helpful, the chicken flavorful and moist and the side......just sides but worth a try!
I've been going to Eisela for years to do my color. I always leave feeling beautiful and I get the nicest compliments on my hair. 
Eisela is patient and truly wants her clients to be happy. I look forward to every appointment and have brought my daughter, mother, and mother-in-law to Eisela because I trust her and know she always lives up to expectations.
The other day at 11:30am I got a call at work informing me my car has a flat tire.  Bummer!  After I convinced a manly coworker to come out and help me change it, I was off to the Discount Tire closest to my house.  

I didn't make an appointment, had a quick wait in line at 1pm, and then left my car in their hands.  Several hours l called to find out if my car was ready and what I owed.  The man I talked to let me know that the tire was unable to be fixed, but because I bought tires from them several years ago it was under warranty and I would be getting a new tire.  Total:  $31.00.  Peace of mind:  Priceless.

Another plus - my fiance had to be at work early, so he dropped me off at Discount Tire at 7:30am the next morning to wait until they opened at 8am so I could pick my car up.  When I arrived, they opened the doors earlier to help me get on my way!  Oh!  And my car was stored in the garage over night.  

I will never bring my tire troubles anywhere else!
It didn't even take longer than 3 minutes into our meal before everyone was thanking me for recommending Cafe Carumba as our lunch venue on Friday. How could I recommend anything else though? It was close to the office, I hadn't been there before, and well, they serve breakfast til 2pm EVERY DAY. There was absolutely nothing disappointing about this experience. 

A large group of us gathered there on Friday and when I arrived we had received a room in the back all to ourselves with a long table. It was absolutely perfect. Our server was a true gem. We had waters on our table when we arrived and he put up with our wishy washyness when it came to our orders. I started off with a mimosa that, despite being pulpy, which I typically don't care for, was absolutely enchanting. It came in a wine glass instead of a champagne glass. More is better :)

As it came time to order I couldn't move past the breakfast menu and thought I had settled on the perfect treat. Then I was told by the server there was an underground breakfast menu that included five different types of eggs benedict. Yes you heard me correctly. I did say five. There was the traditional one, one with avocado, one with portabello, one with crab cakes instead of an english muffin, which a coworker got, and the steak one that I decided to try. 

When our food first started to arrive we were told it was being brought out as its done so it stays hot. We began to worry that we would be eating without everyone but that worry lasted maybe 45 seconds as instantly the rest of the food was brought out. Silence followed for at least the first 10 minutes aside from messages of thanks and grunts of happiness.

The potatoes are as heavenly as everyone says.. you need to have them. I also recommend the eggs benedict with steak instead of canadian bacon. I typically down my breakfast (ask anyone) but I couldn't finish my last eggs benedict. I did manage to have two mimosas though. Yum.

At the end of the meal, the sever brought me out a foil rose which I've attached and still have. Why can't all men be as sweet?

In the end the food is phenomenal, the mimosas are exquisite and larger than the ones elsewhere, service is prompt and extremely friendly. I will be back again.
I have been to this place several time as it is quite convenient for a large group of people, ok prices and the atmosphere is not too bad either. There are hooks to hang your coats and outlets at every tables against the wall, pretty convenient and a nice place to "study." They also have free Wi-Fi as well, so remember to ask for the passwords!

Just putting this out there, don't come here and expect good service lol. The service is terrible and the servers look like they hate working here. 

Order: 
-Sour & Spicy Shredded Potato - $4.49: Horrible. I believe the potatoes were pretty much raw, and the sauce was so sour that it gave me a stomach ache after having a few bites. The pepper flakes added no flavor nor spiciness to the dish.

-Peach & Melon Green tea - $5.49: Surprisingly it tastes really good! The tea wasn't too sweet and the peach flavor wasn't too artificial, a very nice and relaxing cup of tea. 

-Black Sticky Rice with Durian - $5.49:  the black sticky rice has a nutty and natural sweet flavor, and here it was paired with sweet coconut milk, delicious! If you don't like durian, try the mango version as the sticky rice can basically go with any fruits :D. However, for a $6 dessert I wish there was more black sticky rice :(...

-Traditional Braised Beef Noodles - $8.99: bad. On the menu it says the broth is supposed  to be spicy, but I would say the spicy level were non-existent. Also, the broth was so sour! Is it just me or the chef here loves to put vinegar in all the savoury dishes?! The tomato added a bit of sweetness but the sourness of the broth overpowered everything else. The braised beef brisket was tender and very good, but my beef pieces were all fat!! 

Conclusion: Come here for the dessert, not savoury dishes. There are so many options around Chinatown that it would be better to have dinner around the area, then come here for their dessert.
I've been to San Tan Brewery a few times and have had good expeiences overall. My favorite beer is the Mr. Pineapple! One of the best beers I have ever had in my entire life!!! The food is also good and offers a lot of variety. I particularly like the daily selection choices. My favorite dish has been the street tacos. Staff is also very friendly and has a good overall vibe.
I have experienced better than Texas Roadhouse.

I came here after a recommendation from one of my co-workers. We started off with the butter rolls which were delicious. They had a cinnamon butter which was decadent and very tasty. We got the Cactus Blossom for an appetizer which is very similar to a Bloomin' Onion from Outback, just not as big. The dipping sauce it came with was very good.

For an entree, I got a half slab of ribs with mashed potatoes and a cup of chili as my two sides. My partner got a 6 OZ sirloin steak with the same two sides.

The ribs were disappointing. You can tell that they are reheated and they become overcooked because of this. They are not fall of the bone as they say they are, you really have to pull those ribs apart and when you do, the meat is stringy and chewy. I had to pick apart the ribs and I only ate the parts that were not overcooked. The mashed potatoes were not my favorite, I had maybe two spoonfuls of it.

My partner's steak was cooked well, but it was nothing to write home about. It was still a little chewy although he got medium rare and we had to use the steak sauce that's on the table to give it some flavor.

Our cup of chili never came, so we asked to get it to go and our server was kind enough to give us our appetizer for free. 

I am not sure if we came to the wrong Texas Roadhouse at the wrong time, but we were not impressed, and a little bit disappointed towards the end. I don't think we will be giving this place a shot any time soon.
So disappointed in the lobster mac and cheese :c

The shells were literally tasteless. No flavor at all. No cheesey flavor. 
The texture felt like is was reheated leftovers and the shells were mushy and easily broken.

The lobster is claw meat and didn't taste fresh. Don't recommend.
I feel ripped off. I look at other peoples pictures of the same food, and mine looked nothing like it.
Stopped by this Smashburger after cleaning the Boat on Lake Wylie. Casual dining..huge menu with choices of a thousand different toppings. Burgers came quickly , We ordered an assortment with one to go also. My sister had a Vegetarian Bean Burger, turned into a California Burger, My husband had the Bacon Burger with Jalapenos and Onion and Tomato and Lettuce. I ordered the Truffle Mayo and Swiss cheese mushroom burger - I neglected to tell them I wanted anything else on mine..so it was plain but that was my fault. We loved the Fries with Olive Oil, Rosemary and garlic. The Haystack Onion Strings were good but a small order.  Expensive..kind of..47.00 for 4 hamburgers and two beers...but good quality in everything we had! Try it!
Note: I judge Vietnamese places on four things: pho, spring rolls, peanut dipping sauce and avocado shakes. 

Vietnam Grille just didn't impress me on any level. For such a highly regarded Vietnamese joint, I expected a lot more. The spring rolls were on the the smaller side. While the fillings were fresh, they were missing something. The peanut sauce was overly sweet and not that peanuty. The pho was severely over spiced and much too fragrant. The star anise was an overpowering flavor in the broth. The pieces of flank steak weren't the beautifully, paper thin slices that I've had at every other Vietnamese place. The tendon was undercooked and too chewy... Definitely not my fave. The avocado smoothie was no where to be found on the menu... One of the things I love about Vietnamese food is how much food you get for the price. I thought that Vietnam Grille's prices were on the higher end of what I'm accustomed to seeing. 

The positives... The service was fine and the parking was plentiful. 

Needless to say, I'll be continuing my search for my go-to Vietnamese joint in Charlotte.
Bought a groupon since my favorite (cobblestone auto spa) hasn't had a groupon in a while. I did not like the experience and they should call themselves a car dirtier because I feel my car was more dirty than when I brought it in.
It was Insomnia that introduced me to the word "brunch" 2 years ago, so I have to say, thank you so much!! ;) 

Food: 
-the Sun Salutation -$9: I admit, the price is quite steep for a simple dish. But nonetheless it was delicious but just a tad sweet in my opinion. The fruits and honey were already sweet enough, I didn't think the raisins were needed.

-Isabelle -$13: Of course the egg benedicts were spot on, and slathered with a yummy Hollandaise sauce. The homefries aren't your normal fries, they are baked potatoes and covered in their "Legendary Sauce" without them being soggy. I have no idea what the sauce was, but it seems to be a ketchup based sauce? They were soooo gooood and I would definitely come back here just for their homefries. The mixed greens were lightly dressed with a vinaigrette, very refreshing and lightened up the dish! :) Unfortunately I don't think my muffins were toasted, they came out cold and too chewy for my taste.

-MANAMI - $12: The curry rice cakes were the spotlight of this dish! It's like the chef got some leftover curry rice, did some magical thing and boom, flavorful patties were born :D. You can substitute your bread with this for $2 and I would take the curry rice cakes over the english muffins any day! Other than that, the egg benedicts were perfect again, the Hollandaise sauce wasn't too heavy and had a hint of citrus. My friend also got a side order of peameal and I wish the waitress would have asked if she wanted to incorporate it with the egg benedict, as it looked quite sad like that on the side lol but oh well, it wasn't a big deal.

While the wait at Insomnia was quite long, I would say the wait was worth it! The restaurant have great brunch options at great values, the servers are friendly and efficient for a really busy place. Apparently I heard their pancakes are delicious so I can't wait to come back! If you are around the area, definitely give this place a try as it is a solid brunch spot in downtown Toronto :).
We came here for breakfast and had a really good time. We were able to be seated as soon as we walked in with no problems. They also have complimentary parking. We sat outside where we was covered in a shaded area. The wait staff was great, attentive, knowledgeable and patient with us since it was our first time eating there. 

The food was really good too. I had the sweet potato pancakes and scrambled eggs and she had the shoo fly shrimp and grits. The biscuits with jam\/honey was soo good too. They were not skimping on the champagne in our mimosas either lol. 

Overall this was a great place to have breakfast in Charlotte.
Sundays, get there before 12
Although i haven't used the facilities yet the staff was amazing! Super friendly and patient with the jerk ahead of me. If you go definitely see Lindsey super awesome! I gave 4 stars because i didn't take a tour so I'm not positive of the equipment.
I was so excited to try Urban Picnic. I walked in and could tell they were short staffed right away. The girl behind the register was also the runner for the food so she was alternating back and forth. Dark clouds on the horizon. 

Constructive criticism: They need to invest in a large version of their menu, simply stapling their paper Togo menu to the wall was confusing and hard to read. Choose a different corner to cut.

I ordered the veggie pressed sandwich and the kids Mac n' cheese. My friend ordered a salad and a kids meal as well. Her food came out in 20 minutes, and mine was FAR behind. 35 minutes later, my "hot pressed" sandwich came out completely cold in the middle. Disappointing and gross. I went to refill my ice tea, they were out. Bummer. I didn't even eat the sandwich, and left hungry. 

All signs of my experience point to simply being under staffed. I saw a total of three humans trying to man this sinking ship. Based on the previous reviews, it seems like this was a fluke. Hopefully.
It's awesome. I got a vegan sandwich to take out and it was loaded with marinated eggplant, olives, greens and other morsels of tastiness. I had a salted dark chocolate chip cookie with it. Like the sandwich, the cookie also came loaded--this time with chocolate chunks. The cookie was not soft, rather it had a nice crunch as I bit into it, which I really liked. It was amply sized as well, which pleased me.
This is my go-to health foods store in the city and I will purposely go out of my way to shop there. They have the widest range of products and selection and 95% of the time they have the best prices too. For example, there is a type of dried seaweed that I like that Whole Foods sells for $9.99 and Herbs & Nutrition carries it for $6.99. There is no reason why Whole Foods should have a $3 markup! I will support local, independent stores, thank you very much. 

They have a sale section at the front of the store (between the fridges on the left and the cashiers on the right) as well as at the end of the aisles. At the back of the store you will find some bulk bins as well as fresh produce and more refrigerated and frozen items. This store does not have a huge bulk section, but luckily Bulk Barn is not too far away if you are looking for those types of items. 

Come here for your teas, coffees, spices, organic goods, vegetarian \/ vegan items, supplements, herbal products, protein bars and more! My favourite thing - they accept American Express - bonus!
Cheap, yummy and a fun way to do dessert. One day I will break my bad habits and actually get fruit on my yogurt. Until then, cookie dough, Oreos and chocolate syrup will remain my true and loyal friends.
So I will say that I am kind of hit or miss with the Gap... I do quite like Banana Republic but I suppose that is an entirely different store. SO This gap... Well I will say that due to the type of clientele, they have and absolutely perfect spot in Madison. I have shopped here a couple different times and it seems every time has been different. Times I have gone in and never been helped when obviously looking for something, other times there have been a surplus of employees. 

Men's department is slight compared to the women's department which is ok I guess but a little disappointing considering the other Gap is in the West Towne mall which is Miles away. Store is always very clean and the dressing rooms are empty without clutter almost every time I have been there. They have a great AD behind the registers which is bright and can sort of just boost your mood... until you walk up to it and it gives you a migraine.

The main reason for the 3 Star rating is simply lack of selection for men. Although like I said the women's section is plentiful and likely makes up the difference in that. Great store otherwise though!
After getting my first dog from the pound (Mr. Watson, the monocle-wearing schnauzer miz) I had a voucher for a free vet visit on the City as part of the deal. This place is right in the middle of my hood, so naturally we took the wee pup here for his first visit. 

We called ahead of time to make an appointment and clarify that the voucher was good for one free visit and were given the all clear. So thermometers were inserted in very awkward places and our little pup was weighed, measured, and found to be totally awesome. End of vet visit we're presented with a bill for 40 some odd bucks.

After some pretty heavy complaining that, "WTF, mate? That's not what you said on the phone," they waived the initial visitation fee and let us go on our merry way. I've cross checked the prices here with other vets to get the little booger vaccinated and sure enough, they charged for the vet visit in addition to the vaccination fees. 

Go to Blue Cross Animal Clinic down the street and they'll charge you the flat fee for the vaccine, no office visit or nothin'. Sure beats the crappy clinic at Petsmart too, where they charge the same straight fee for the vaccines and waive the vet visit. 

I do like that I'm still on their mailing list though, and get my yearly check-up reminder for my little pupperoni.
I'm from chicago so i been eating there forever. and its much better and fresher then all other fast food joints, the curds insane, burgers so good and fries are top notch. I'm not a huge fan of there tomatoes all the time but there onions are the best anywhere and have a kick for sure. 
I also love there chicken dinner too but there fish dinner might be the best anywhere around, i would highly recommend giving it a shot if you don't want a burger! i don't like there chicken tenders but i love there spicy chicken tenders, totally dif breading on each and the regular ones don't cut it for me or my kids. the custard if fresh and so good too, kids get free custard with the kids meals too
Good food but only got 2 out of 3 pizzas. Slow service. Wanted to close so would not serve beer. Had an hour before they were closing.
I would give less if it were possible, and here's why... The business owner (Sherene) has been EXTREMELY difficult to get ahold of, and once we were able to speak to her, she was incredibly rude and less than accommodating.

My fiancé tried to purchase a gift certificate for me on Mother's Day (which is advertised on her website) to have my eyebrows microbladed. It says on the website that she accepted PayPal, MasterCard, & Visa as payment. When my fiancé called to purchase the gift certificate, Sherene INSISTED she would only take payment from him in cash, which was weird not only because we knew services would not be rendered immediately (as I pregnant and she would not perform microblading on pregnant or breastfeeding women. I was looking forward to the experience after pregnancy) but also because we lived 60 miles from the studio. She told us to come pick up the certificate and that she would have "Danica" re-write it because we "took too long to pick up the first one"(After stating it would be a week or so before we could make it to Scottsdale).

After several attempts to pay for and receive the gift certificate, on not only my fiancé's part, but mine as well (her excuse was that she was very busy and the BEST around), I finally went in to the "studio" which was very hidden and hard to find. The door was locked and there was a sign that directed you to a different building if you were looking for Sherene. I knocked on the door and it was answered by a woman wearing a necklace that said "Danica". She informed me that Sherene was out of the office, actually stating that she was "on the ocean somewhere" and had me write down my fiancé and I's contact information (on the back of a random envelope) to get back to us. When I told "Danica" that she was the one that was supposed to have my gift certificate, she blew me off saying she was with a client and that there were TWO Danica's that worked there, so it must have been the other one who had the gift certificate.

Then tonight at 10:45pm Sherene called my fiancé and said that our business was too much of a hassle for her, and due to "good business practices" she was not going to perform the services for me. Once they were off the phone, she text messaged him and said she had recorded the phone call without him knowing, so I had my attorney call her and she questioned him as to why he was phoning her at 11:00 at night and then hung up on him.

This place has been a nightmare and a hassle from the start, and I would't recommend this place to anybody. The staff, ESPECIALLY, the owner Sherene, are all rude and run their business in a very nonprofessional manner. I am writing this review in an attempt to save anyone the hassle and hours I spent trying to deal with this business. The great news is, I have found a different business that is very reputable and accepts all normal forms of payment (not INSISTING on cash) who made my brows on fleek!
Si vous aimez les saucisses, vous allez adorer cet endroit. Des sortes pour tous les goût entre 2@4$ la saussice. En plus, ils ont une sélection de bière de microbraseries. Dans le même magasin, on y retrouve aussi un bar laitier, avec slush, smoothies, crèmes glacés et quelques sorbet. 

Mais le plus beau dans tout cela c'est... LEUR FAMEUX SANDWICH AVEC UNE SAUCISSE. Idéal pour goûter une nouvelle saveur de saucisse. On y ajoute, de la moutarde, mayo, choucroute, piments forts et cornichon. Et le plus beau dans tout cela c'est qu'il en coûte 5$ + tx. 

Vous pouvez manger votre crème glacé ou votre sandwich devant le Walter, à la placr Valois.  Il y a aussi quelques tables et chaises disponible :)
I'm gonna update my review from the last time and have to say that while the food quality has remained stellar, the service quality has gone down. Allow me to elaborate: when I visited a year ago, the individuals who were behind the counter treated me like a customer, which is to say--they cared. Now, based on the past few times I have visited, the customer seems to have become an afterthought. Which is to say, as the other Yelper who has commented on this place rightly asserted, it seemed as though my presence was an inconvenience to the staff. I did not feel welcome.
Broom Wagon is a great city cycling shop.  I'd done business with some of the staff when they used to work at the legendary Urbane Cyclist.

My wife bought an excellent city commuter from owner Marty at Broom Wagon, an Opus, Quebec company. She's thrilled with it and was very happy how they treated her. They seem to have a good stock of  well-priced, high-quality city bikes. 

I just took in my bike for servicing, mechanic Theo was thorough, communicative and creative in his solutions, and the price was very reasonable. Outstanding service.

Broom Wagon looks to be a new classic "Local Bike Shop" on the Danforth, this is the kind of shop you want to go rather than buy a cheap junker at a big-box store. Quality machines, knowledgeable helpful staff.  This place deserves support.
Great selection of products and also a 15% check in offer? Can't beat that! I see in a lot of the reviews that they are very picky with what they decide to consign. And they are doing a great job at it based on the high quality products they had in store. 

I love how they divide the different types of clothing separating the designer from the vintage from the regular tops\/bottoms. I think that's genius so that you can search based on what you're looking for. 

I was a bit disappointed by their handbag selection but that isn't their fault-I haven't seen to many Gucci bags being carried around Madison so obviously there aren't too many that are consigning them either. 

I left with a cute Zara dress for later on in the Fall and an eclectic belt. I'll definitely be back to check out any new items in a few weeks!
I've been to 4 different Brazilian churrascarias in Vegas and this one is at the bottom of the totem pole. Smaller salad bar with fewer options. Pao de queijo (cheesebread) is not fresh and sits in a heated serving bin. Same thing with the fried plantains. The caipirihna drink needs to be sweeter. I've been to Rio so I know what a caipirihna should taste like.
Meats just not as tender and of the quality that you can find elsewhere. They are just a tad below par on many details of the food. For locals it's not worth the hassle of hauling yourself to the Miracle Mile Shops.
I have been coming here on and off for over eight years, and I have never been disappointed by the service that I received.

Today I was offered complimentary tea or what upon my arrival, and the technician (Jane) was very patient with me as I was very indecisive about what colour I wanted for my pedicure. She brought multiple colours to the station and tested them out on my fingernails. She then set up my massage chair for me and brought me a selection of the most recent tabloid magazines. I really appreciated that she did not gawk at the atrocious condition of my feet (I'm a runner), and when I tried to apologize for them, she said it was no problem at all in a very sincere way and I actually felt like she meant it. She treated my feet with great care.

The salon is very clean and they open a new package of instruments for each client that they can then keep in the client's own box. I brought my own cuticle cutters and she was more than willing to use them, and cleaned them for me after.

From beginning to end I had a great experience at Spa Nails. I would definitely recommend it, and I will return again when I am in the area and in need of a pedicure.
My son (and I) have been signed with FORD Robert Black Agency coming to a year now and I have to say we have been super happy to be with them. Both Sheree and Matt (our agent) were talents themselves in the years past so they are über knowledge about the industry. 
I know Matt E. has a vast base of talents yet each time I contact him, he is able to get back to me right away and answers any concerns I may have. It's fantastic!
Since being with FORD, I've had multiple auditions ranging from SAG film to industry videos. My son has also had multiple auditions and has booked a web video and 2 commercials. Yes, in case you're wondering when my son booked his commercials, he jumped up and down with excitement and of course, as his mom I grinned from ear to ear with happiness for him!  
FORD has a stellar international reputation and the local agency FORD Robert Black Agency of Arizona is no exception. They are one of the few SAG agencies. If you are thinking of getting representation, I would highly recommend FORDRBA!  They have open casting call each week- check their website for complete details!
Comfortable fine dining is the perfect description for this place.  The space was warm, inviting, and simple.  The star was the food with its simple ease that makes good cooking seem like no work at all.  The cured meats plate was delicious with a variety of different kinds of pork, each different but complimentary to the warm bread puffs. The hand made pasta was a little too rich and buttery but that may be what others would love about it.  The pork chop was perfectly juicy and cooked precisely as asked. Unlike other high end places in Vegas, it wasn't intimidating or discouraging.  (see my review for le cirque if curious.)  Would definitely go back next time in Vegas.
Went to dive around 10 pm on a Saturday night. It was half off apps and I got a chicken parm sandwich. The food was really good! Recommend the zucchini fries and pretzel sticks for an app! 

I only deducted a star because the service was quite slow. I waited around 20 minutes for apps and another 20 for food. 

Atmosphere was good. Pretty loud because it was a bar which was just what I expected! I would recommend this place for dinner or lunch.
This place got worst, to location and workers!
Every worker at this place only look to buy that interest their wardrobe and price it low so they can get it cheap themselves. Workers has no knowledge about fashion.
There's others stores you can sell in Main Street! Avoid this place and not waste your time. 
Be careful about buying the items behind the counter that they price so high even tho they are all counterfeits!
District Manager needs to get this place right. Starting with workers!
Recently purchase a Fantex Ash from here and had it delivered yesterday. The tree was amazing and the delivery crew did an awesome job in planting the tree and cleaning up. I highly recommend you shop here when in the market for for outdoor or indoor plants\/trees.
XS - Is the prettiest club ever. Its big, 

The ladies gorgeous - but can you not all wear black dresses with no accessories? 
Guys - not as gorgeous. Except I met a football player who shall remain anonymous and we were there before Magic and there were alot of nicely-clothed men.

Gambling option in the club was cool - loved dancing in the wading area of the pool - my feet hurt! BUT the DJ - um meh. Def not the best which kinda ruins the ambiance of the club.
 I mean you charge people $$ to get in so please spend some of it on a DJ that can mix. Which is not related to my request for more hiphop. Maybe that isn't your crowd, XS. Crowd was not diverse.

The cabanas were cool, there are like three lounge couches... I dont know if I'd do that because the even the line for table reservations was monstrous.

Things to KNOW:
The chandeliers in the main dance area make it rain - Grown men will push a girl in heels for a dollar.
 
The lounge beds that sit in the pool are for everyone - so if some ass comes up to you and says you cant sit there - this is our area - they paid for the circle beds around the pool and bottle service - you do not have to move or leave. 

If you get in, you have ins and out without having to wait in that horrid line - juts make sure your stamp is still there. So take a break - go eat something, hit the tables or a strip club, come back.
Food is great when work pays for it.

I got it delivered to my house once. The driver parked in my [angry] neighbor's driveway. I ordered buffalo wings with bleu cheese and they gave me ranch. Yuck!

I sent them a message about my disappointment, both through their website and good old e-mail. No response and no remorse. 

I'll never ever turn down a delicious Angelo's morsel, but I sure as heck will never pay for it again!
I love rebar, there are tons of friendly people here-I almost always make new friends when I come. The drinks are always flowing, and the food is always good! My favorite dishes are the black bean burger, the jicama that comes with the wings, and the grits and shrimp. Definitely a good place for vodka mixers-less options when it comes to wine.
This place is always so dirty and grimy, been there twice and will not be back.  Customer service is horrible!!!
Killer. Went here for the first time today on a recommendation and was blown away! Go. Just trust me, go now - order the chicken steamed bao, you won't regret it. I can't wait to go back!
Yes, the reviews are accurate. Had to try this place for myself. Really fresh banchan dishes, excellent dol sot bi bim bop, maybe the best in Vegas, better than what you can get at Greenland. Definitely an odd location but they've been there for 11 years! Great healthy lunch for 8 bucks. Friendly service. Hard to beat that.
This place is one of the best so far their emergency room is clean and their fast your not waiting forever their medical offices are the same way their staff and doctors are very nice in fact awesome...
It doesn't matter if you come here at 3am or 11am, the donuts always have the same freshness and taste. Consistency is key. There is no experimenting, or obnoxious 'sardine and sprinkle' flavors. Just pure, traditional donut goodness. My personal favorites are the cake donuts, especially the blueberry flavor. I also appreciate that their prices stay affordable, and for less than 10 bucks you can get a dozen! Guilty pleasure for sure! Happiness IS Bosa!
I have been to 3rd Place twice now and have yet to be disappointed.  The service is always great, never waiting for refills and always a smiling face.  The food is fantastic and full of flavor.  Since everytime I have gone it has been with a large party I have had the chance to taste many different items off their menu. In the realm of their burgers the French Onion Burger, the Black and Bleu Burger, and my husband had the AZ Foot Long Hot Dog, since I don't like hotdogs I will take my husband word for it that it was great.  By far the black and Bleu Burger was my favorite the bread that they use was the perfect topping for this rich garlic and bleu cheese delight.  I too had the Grilled Sonoran Chicken and felt that the pancakes were a little off but enjoyed the flavor of the chicken and red chile sauce.  If I got it again I may ask for no pancakes.  I was able to taste the Texas Grilled Ribeye and felt that the seasoning was perfect for the steak, which by the way melted in my mouth.  Their signature Prickly Pear Glazed Pork Tenderloin was fantastic, I tried it even though I don't normally like pork in any form and found myself drooling over my mother-in-laws dish.   It is always a little annoying when they over season meat that really should be allowed to shine on its own but here the Filet Mignon was seasoned just right to show off the beautiful cut of meat.  My 11 year old daughter sat quietly not commenting on her meal as she ate the Southwestern Seared Salmon.  Once she had cleared her plate, which she rarely does at any restaurant, she started telling everyone how great her meal was.  I think she was afraid that if she said anything others would want to taste her meal too.  Now to desert.  The banana pudding was so rich and creamy that I had to take at least one bite, followed by benedryl stupid allergies.  The cute little cookies and milk dish was a huge hit.  But the sampler truly shined.  The sampler comes with a slice of their Carrot Cake, Tres Leches Cake, and Texas Sheet Cake.  I don't like carrot cake normally but tried it anyway and it was better than I remembered carrot cake, still not a fan.  The Tres Leches Cake was so rich and creamy that I was sad to see it leave the plate so quickly.  The Texas Sheet Cake showed how salt and chocolate should always stay great friends, I couldn't seem to get enough of this rich salty sweet delight.
For those of you worried about the fact that it is a church on Sundays, and for all of the sinners out there that should beware, you may want to rethink and try this place again.  It is now football season and they do have hours on Sundays, though shortened.
Lovely mid- level antique shop featuring booths styled by individual dealers with varying styles.  You will find collectibles ranging from mid 1800's to some new items.

This antique store is mostly open booths which is nice to get a closer look.  They have a rug gallery voted best in Phoenix.

My favorite spaces have mid century modern furniture or colored depression glass.  I've purchased a lovely Danish hexagonal mirror, a lucite stool, glass perfume bottles, and more at this antique store over the last year.

The gals at the counter always greet us and never hover.  Last time I was fortunate enough to make an offer on 3 items from the same dealer and got 20% off because of it!  Thank you Pat!
Just ordered takeout and this is my new fav Asian spot. Cinnamon shrimp was uniquely flavored and delicious. Lettuce wraps were awesome. And chicken with fried rice hit the spot. Can't wait to return and try some other dishes!
Tiny adorable cafe on 32nd at and Indian school!!

I choose here to have breakfast with a friend.  I did a drive by because this place is tucked away on the north west corner next to a Pilates studio.

When we went in a lady was scooping cookie dough! Homemade food wins my heart.  

We ordered the turkey egg white sandwich and the turkey jalapeño sandwich.  Both were yummy with fresh roasted turkey!  Yum.  The only thing I would change is more jalapeño because I could not taste it at all. 

Super reasonably priced!  We sat in the patio but maybe would sit inside next time because we did get asked for money while sitting there.
The owners of this place were super nice and welcoming the food was very good and authentic we tried the lamb sausage and eggs and also couscous w lamb everything was great. Five stars
Volo used to be my ultimate beer destination if I wanted to have one of my favourites or felt like trying something new. And don't get me wrong, they still do have one of the most extensive beer menus in town, covering the whole range from fruit flavoured kinds to stouts. 

However every time I go there it's never quite perfect. It's like they are on purpose trying to offset your blissful beer savouring session. It can be anything: a waiter who got up on the wrong side of the bed,  often non functioning urinals (I do hope the sign I saw the last time on the ladies' washroom saying "Temporarily unisex. Sorry for the inconvenience" was a joke by some prankster) and occasionally smelly washrooms, chronic shortage of menus, low stiff benches and high tables that never allow you lean back and relax properly, etc. And accepting only Visa or cash? I mean c'mon! Plus I don't find their food menu to be anything special and their bottled beer prices are about 30-35% higher than what they should be. 

All of this reminds me of what Dan's character in the movie "Waiting..." was preaching: The difference between ordinary and extraordinary, is that little extra. And this place certainly can be extraordinary with very little extra effort invested. Unfortunately whoever owns the places obviously doesn't care.
I've been coming here for a little over a year and prefer this hookah bar over many in the area for many reasons. The employees are down to earth, they are professional, yet helpful and easy to talk to. The owner and his son are ALWAYS courteous and quick to recognize their frequent customers. The quality of the shisha is a lot better than some of the other bars in this area. The atmosphere is great for many different kinds of smokers. There is a place for your more reserved smoker and Billards and a juke box for your more outgoing and social hookah lovers. The prices are very appeasing but the deal breaker for me is customer service. You will not find better customer service anywhere around than you will here!!! Love this place and will remain a loyal customer. The ONLY thing I will recommend is getting beer and wine like their salisbury location! That would be the icing on the cake for me.
Purchased a home in Scottsdale and AZ Elite managed it for a little longer than a year until I could relocate. They rented it out promptly and I agreed to rent to a couple with two small dogs. Renters were responsible for landscape, which was probably an error on my part. When I relocated I realized the landscape had not been care for at all, which cost me thousands. AZ Elite obviously never checked on it. The dogs ruined my carpet in all three bedrooms and instead of withholding the security deposit, AZ Elite returned it to the renters and the carpet cleaning company called me for payment because AZ Elite wouldn't pay them, which the carpet company told me was typical and why they likely would sever ties with AZ Elite. On a positive note, I did remain positive on my investment in the year+ I was unable to occupy it and for that I'm thankful.
I love this speciality running store!  If you're getting into some regular running, want to start, or need a good pair of running shoes definitely come here and get their expert advice.  They'll get you fitted with a great pair of shoes, have you run for them, and really know their stuff.  There's also a great stock of clothing and accessories.  

SRC also offers group runs and put together a great pre race tent for PF Chang's Rock n Roll 1\/2 marathon and maration.  It may be hard to find back in that corner, but definitely try them out!
I'm not afraid to admit it, I found out about Laura through a mutual follow on instagram. That's right. And well, I had been looking for a new brow person since the one recommended near my house is clearly a dud. 

I'm not a girlie girl either, so I get my brows waxed like um a few times a year. Thankfully I don't really have bushman eyebrows to begin with. However, I've been having them waxed for over a decade so I know a good waxer when I come across one. And Laura is good.

Her station is immaculate and calming and she is super fun to talk to. Waxes are very reasonably priced and painless. They even come with a tint, which I had never had before, and is like magic people. Like magic.

Bonus is that she's ready at the actual time of your appointment. And I was able to schedule via text. WIN!! Everyplace should allow me to text or some other call-free way of appointment booking.

Laura, I'm sorry I haven't been there in like six months, but I'm due soon. And you'll be the one I text :)
Saturday brunch book club pick for our group of 5 ladies and 2 babies.  We met here at 10 am and had ample parking.

We are seated at the big table in the back and wait at least 10 minutes for anyone to take our drink orders even though the place was empty.

We ordered 2 simple breakfasts, buckwheat pancakes, breakfast tacos and stuffed French toast.  Our food was all quite good with everyone happy with their dishes.

Through the meal, our server Cassandra was very lax and uninterested in her job. The first cup of coffee was only filled 1\/2 way... ok no prob.  Finally I flag her down for a refill which she says "I have to brew more".  Yah do it!  Finally when she comes back she pours another 1\/2 cup. Lame!

The manager I believe was a lady in a burgundy dress with lace at the top, who was behind the bar barely checked in at the end and didn't ask us about our experience and just commented on the babies.  This place isn't going to last if they don't improve their baseline service levels.
So I stumbled into this Giant Eagle Market District on my way home from Trader Joe's.  (Note: The only grumble I have with TJ is lack of everyday essentials and I was suprised to learn that TJ doesn't stock dry beans).  So I am headstrong about making lentil soup that day and instead of going to Whole Foods (see past review).

I have been to the South Hills GE Market District before.  I actually enjoy the experience of walking around HUGE stores that overwhelm me with variety and random things.  Thus is the experience of GE Market District.  You are in a full-service grocery store that caters to all income levels.  AND you get FUEL POINTS for wasabi-covered soy beans.  Fantastic!  They give you a map of the store, which is truly needed, because the variety and stock is endless.  The parking at the Shadyside GE is sort of hectic.  Making a left out of the parking lot is pretty difficult.  I enjoy these new Giant Eagle grocery-monopoly attempts.
This bar is pretty cool and it's part of the revival of downtown Las Vegas.
Enjoying this part isn't hard, with 99% of bars with a lot machines ringing the whole time it great to find a place your able to sit down and have a drink with friends.

The decor is pretty standard vintage slash nightclub theme, yes I'm not sure if that's the best way to define it but hey I wasn't an art major.

I never got to head upstairs but that is for sure a Sunday session waiting to happen!
I don't think this is owned by Japanese people... food was o.k. nothing outstanding, but nothing bad either. I'm from Japan, so I guess I'm a little bit spoiled when it comes to Shabu Shabu. It's delightful to have Shabu Shabu place here in Las Vegas though.
We had an excellent brunch today at Dragonfly Cafe.  Service was excellent, we had our 2 year old daughter and they brought her out special toys to play with and made sure we had everything we needed for her.  Service like this makes all the difference in the world when eating out with kids.  Kids meal was huge and they only charged $3.50, a great deal for kids. 

I had the cinnamon pecan multi-grain pancakes and they were great.  Not a light and fluffy pancake if that's what you are looking for, they were hearty and filling, great flavor.  My husband got a chicken, apple, cranberry salad with this amazing poppyseed dressing.  I've never seen anything like this dressing - completely clear in color with except the poppy seeds in it, but tasted like any other poppyseed dressing.  Salad was fresh, crisp, and very filling.  Chicken has amazing flavor.

They have all locally grown, organic products and hormone free meat.  Everything seems fresh and was prepared well.  

I'd highly recommend this place anytime for a good, quick, easy breakfast or lunch.  It's worth your time to stop in and check it out.  

Other pluses: cute patio outside but it was too hot today to sit out there.
Definitely worth seeing while in Montreal. You can see an awesome view of Montreal while on the top of the Mont Royal. I've been here before when I was a kid, but now back at it as an adult it was just lovely. Get your walking shoes on because in order to enter you have to climb the mountain and the stairway is lengthy. For me wearing a dress that day not the best idea I must say. Because what's cool was the fact that they had three separate rows of stairways. The one that stood out to me was the wooden one where you'd have to make the climb to the top on your knees which represents the sacrifice our fathers made before us and your taking that journey and if you make a wish and succeed the climb your wish comes true. (Next time must where jeans lol) 

Saint Joseph' Oratory is huge with 6 levels. 1- Welcome center-Votive chapel, Brother Andres Tomb, Statue of the Virgin, Saint Joseph Oil, Crypt Church, and Hall of Renovation Project, 3- Rest area, 4-Brother Andre's Heart and display on his life. 5- The Oratory Museum, 6- Basilica, Original Chapel, Saint Andre Bessette Chapel.

Parking is free if you are a student of the University of Montreal or $5 if not and admission is free to the church. However the museum inside is I recall $5 per person.

We saw the outdoor garden which depicted Christ's journey with numerous statues and nice horticulture. It was peaceful and serene. We also saw the museum which housed unique displays of nativity scenes throughout the world which was really cool to see. They also had art sculptures, old town maps of Montreal, and beautiful paintings. The chapels and church's are just amazing.
It was pretty good. I can't say anything bad about the place. Good service.
Lunch at the Don's...

Well, that's what it felt like as hubby and I had lunch at this speakeasy. The restaurant opened for lunch at 11:00a but we got there a little early and couldn't really tell where the entrance was. We parked and looked like the place was boarded up... turns out the front entrance was not so obvious. In fact, we entered in this wooden door to find another closed door that was a waiting room (no seats). We had to ring the doorbell and wait until someone opened a little peep window to let us in. This little waiting place had photos of wanted mafia members and dons. We were let inside the restaurant by a host who looked like he portrayed an associate dressed as a gangster, suspenders and all, and led us past the bar to the back section of the restaurant. 

The quiet, casual elegant setting had a mob theme with the red leather seats, the glass chandeliers, the black wallpapered walls, and more photos of mafia dons and gangsters hung on the walls. It was like a scene from The Godfather, the movie. It is dark inside. The wait staff catered to our needs as we were served green salad w\/ garlic dressing, bread\/butter and our orders. I had the "Capones Carbonara" (pancetta, tomatoes, peas, red onions, shallots & fettuccini tossed in garlic egg cream sauce). Eccelente! Mangia!!! Hubby had the  "Vinnie's Chicken Parmesan Melt" (chicken breast, breaded, fried, topped with mozzarella cheese and their secret sauce). If reading that description didn't make your mouth water, well, there are lots more from their menu to choose from and cleverly named with mafia themes. Our food and the atmosphere was great!

The restaurant looked like it can accommodate large groups and banquets as well as intimate dinners for two . There is a private room and it had a booth that can seat two, it also had a screen like you can watch a movie or something. This room had a door and it is in between the bar and the restroom away from the rest of the dining area. 

Located less than 15 minutes from the Strip this made our dining experience unforgettable! Thought that we would get a visit from the don himself... after all, Las Vegas had a history of mafia crime lords.

Review #0459
Typical Pittsburgh pizza delivery joint with one exception- the sandwiches are enormous. A whole sub is easily a filling meal for two. My only complaint is that they use "buffalo fries" (similar to Arby's fries but waffle, not curly) on their buffalo chicken sandwich. Not enough chicken and too many fries. The pizza is great! Must be the same folks as Venice pizzeria because the menus and quality are identical.
Recently tried out their lunch menu and everything was so good! We had the salmon carpaccio, ebi mayo, chicken karaage, ramen and chirashi don. You pay a bit of a premium but worth it.
While I feel Yelpers have overrated the Princess let me preface my review by saying that I stayed here last November for a week when they were under renovation.  While I didn't ask if they were under construction when I made the reservation no one offered me that information.   Despite being in relatively high season the place was essentially empty.  My room was large and comfortable but needed updating and faced the parking lot.  Often noisy in the AM with employees arriving and construction people.  Room was quite far to central part of hotel with long walk to central pool and restaurants.  Normally I wouldn't mind but with the construction the place was like a maze with unmarked dead end corridors and paths.  A good portion of the property was fenced off.   I felt like a rat in a maze at times.  

I ate at the the high end Mex restaurant on property which was good, not great, and had good to excellent service.  Being by the parking lot I self parked which was convenient.  May return to give it another chance as I suspect the construction is now done.  If so I will update my review but for now I would say try some place else, many choices in Scottsdale.
Pretty cool spot. Cool to place to come get drinks. Had the oxtail and veggies. Was a little lacking in flavor. Maybe a pinch of seasoning for the veggies. Sea salt even. Tomato rice was not bad. The beef shanken salad was pretty solid. Liked it. Would get it again. Good soy vinaigrette and good sauce on the beef. I'll try it again. Hopefully gets better.
I wasn't sure if there were cameras around, because it felt like I was in Hell's Kitchen. We ordered the pork belly, poached lobster, smoked beef tartar, all were delicious. First course, market salad and English chowder, not impressed. Second course, 24 oz rib chop, 18 oz NY strip and chicken with tikki masala spices, all unpleasant. Third course, sticky pudding, some cheese cake, these were good. 

Here comes the worst part, we ordered drinks all specialty cocktails, before we can say anything else our server bolted. A busser quickly gave our waters and breads, cocktails come in 15 min, apps next 15, at this point we have finished apps, drinks and half the bread plate, main course 1 hour 48 min after cocktails were served, dessert took another 33 min after we were done. We didn't even finish our main course we were so full from waiting. We had to ask server where are food was and all he said was it comes out when done, WHAT? But i see the manager on duty coming out the back, mouth full of food and didn't even come by to see how we were. Clearly we looked frustrated with our hands to our heads or face looking very disturbed.

I know this business well, and understand it can be busy or kitchen maybe overwhelmed but to have managers and servers like we had was an epic fail for this place. I have booked a group here and they were so happy with everything. We just happen to be there when the drop out staff were working.

Im so disgusted and upset that i don't even want to bring any business here anymore. Go to Stripsteak instead!
Ok so if you're in RH you know it's hard to find good carribean food. This place is good! Our oxtail was plentiful, soft, and the gravy was well done and not watery! Jerk chicken was juicy and tasty too. Definitely glad we tried this place out and will be back soon. Yum!
I sent an email but never heard back....

I just returned from a trip to Vegas, and I wanted to reach out to you about my stay. I called a couple of months ago to book my weekend visit, and was given 1 night comped and a discounted night as well. I was also provided $30.00 in free play and $50.00 in food credit. The purpose of my visit was a getaway for my mom who hasn't been to The Mirage in 27 years, or to Vegas! She and I were very excited.
 
I checked in at The Mirage on March 4th for a 2 night stay. Upon arrival, I was provided an upgrade to the 25th floor into a King Suite, and we were thrilled with the customer service at the front desk.
We got into our room, and everything was great....on the surface. Then it all went downhill.
 
The bellhop brought up our luggage (7 pieces) and placed some things on the counter above the refrigerator. Because of this, we did not see the flyer that stated not to place personal items in the fridge. We placed food that my mother brought to me from the east coast. Needless to say, that food spoiled as the fridge wasn't working.
Our toilet didn't flush unless you flushed 5-10 times, our shower was filled with mold, the ice bucket had a bag of water inside of it and we had invoices and personal letters in our room (from previous guests) that were dated February 5th, so we knew that our room hadn't been cleaned well.
 
At first we called the front desk and we were assured that someone would come to our room, fix the toilet\/mold and clean for us. We were given an additional $50.00 food credit but the cleaning and fixing never happened.
The following day, Saturday, we called again to the front desk and again, we were told that someone would come at noon to take care of the problems, again, this didn't happen.
On Saturday night, I had enough, and stood in the check in line for 40 minutes so that I could speak to someone about our room. I spoke to a lovely lady, and I should have written down her name. She tried so hard to assist, and provided an additional $50.00 in food credit but explained that the hotel was sold out due to the race and there wasn't another room to put me in. I understood, and was grateful for her trying.
On Sunday, I was done..the toilet put me over the edge, and it was truly disgusting.
 
I checked out, and graciously was comped for the entire weekend. I was and still am very thankful for this gesture.
We went outside to get our car from Valet, and then all of the kind gestures went out the door once again.
I saw the valet attendant pull my car up, he got out said my name, but didn't give me enough time to gather my 7 suitcases and get to the car, so he drove off and parked my car.
I went to the valet stand to let them know that I needed my car pulled back up as I couldn't carry all of my baggage and they refused!!! What the heck?!!
 
I don't know how the staff can be so great in some areas, and then not so much in others.
If it wasn't for the front desk and customer service, I would never return. I have stayed at almost every hotel in Las Vegas, and I have seen worse, but I have definitely seen better.
 
Thank you,
Horrible horrible service I have been here for over 40 minutes I just got my food numerous people that have come in after we have been served
Having a last minute trip to Vegas, I decided to book it through hostelbookers for a cheap night stay in Vegas.  Since I was going in 2 days, all the rooms in Vegas were super expensive due to the Mayweather fight that weekend.  All the regular hotels were $100 ~ $125\/night for the older hotels (Luxor, Excalibur, etc), I decided to try this out.

It was about $90 with taxes included for a one night stay (which was discounted from the regular price of $150).  I thought originally this was going to be a hotel\/hostel place, since it was listed on hostelbookers but instead they were just renting out rooms using the hostelbookers website instead.  

After checking in towards the early evening hours, there was no issue. The only requirement I told the staff at the registration desk was that I wanted a NON SMOKING room, I emphasized this a couple times before getting my room key.  The person said that it was non smoking for sure, so I proceed to the room (which was located in the same building as the registration desk).  

When I got into the room, it smelled like cigarettes.  It was quite nasty, as I had a previous stay somewhere else where I got a smoking room, after sleeping there, the next morning, I smelled like cigarettes.

I went back to the front desk to tell them that and they told me it was supposed to be a non smoking room and there was a sign clearly on the room door saying that.  Apparently, someone didn't really give a shit and smoked in there anyways.    I don't blame them, since they don't clean the rooms, they probably didn't know it smelled like that.  The cleaning staff should of done a better job cleaning it or converting that room into a smoking room. That was a mishap on that end.

I managed to get the room exchanged to the adjacent building across the way, next to the parking lot.  This room was a lot better than first one.  It smelled like a regular room and it was clean.  One issue I had was that the bed lacked a thick enough blanket. It was quite thin and when you have the A\/C on, it gets cold after a while when your sleeping. 

Also, the position of the ACs for each room is located in the hall as you walk towards your room.  If it's on, you get this stream of hot air blasting your feet before reaching your room.  Imagine having 10 units on at the same time (which was a bit warm that weekend), all this hot air coming at you after driving for 8+ hours. 

In addition to  having the AC that low towards the wall, when you sleep, the AC is blasting right in your face.  It might be fine for some folks, but I prefer to have it higher up, so my face doesn't get blasted all night.  You can easily get sick from having it that way as well.  I don't think I'll be coming back to this place, it was pretty ghetto.  The price for this place should be more under $50 for what your getting.  I did enjoy the free ice though and the plentiful amount of parking in the back!
Don't get overwhelmed by the endless amount of yummy tapas that Julian Serrano has to offer. Everything on the menu is delicious!! Here is a quick rundown of the different things I had and their individual star rating.

1. Lobster-pineapple skewer -  lobster tail with pineapple and covered with sesame oil - Star Rating * *

2. Seared scallop in a romesco sauce - Star Rating * * * 

3. Sautéed baby spinach with pine nuts, raisins, apples, and shallots - Star Rating * * * * 

4. Marinated olives - Star Rating * * 

5. Pintxo de chorizos, which are mini spanish pork chorizo over garlic mashed potatoes in a garlic sauce - Star Rating * * * * * 

6. Beef and cheese - prime tenderloin topped with cheese, honey, and pecans - Star Rating * * * * 

7. Grilled angus flat iron steak with japanese eggplant and a mushroom demi - Star Rating * * * * *

8. Red Wine Sangria - Star Rating * * * * * 

Again, I think anything you get here will be delicious. And if it's not, it's okay. Tapas are small plates that you share, so just pawn it off to someone else and dig into the next dish.
This is the best Lebanese cuisine I have had since I moved out here from Michigan. They actually have the proper garlic sauce here that is supposed to be served with the chicken shawarma.

The grape leaves and hummus were excellent. The fattoush could have had more pita in it, but it was good. The chicken shawarma was excellent. It was perfectly seasoned.

I definitely will be back. If you like Lebanese food then come try this place. I definitely recommend that you try the shawarma. Good eats!! They also make the pita bread fresh in an oven that you can view from the dining room. Hot and fresh.

I will try the raw kibbie on my next visit and update my review.
I was supposed to get waxed last week for the first time but apparently my underarm hair wasn't long enough, so I was told to come back and make an appointment for the following week. So my following appointment was made for Tuesday the 18th and upon entering the establishment both times all of the women I encountered were so welcoming and made me feel comfortable!! Kai was my esthetician, and as uncomfortable as I was having some one not only stare at my hairy underarms but have to touch them; she made me feel at ease by making small talk. I will definitely be returning for a follow up and I'm considering a Brazilian for the future. This place is super professional and clean!! I would recommend it in a heart beat!
Was here in March with some colleagues for an early dinner and really enjoyed the food and atmosphere! 

The decor is very cool, Korean\/Mexican\/hipster which should be my nightmare but I dug it. 

We shared kalbi ribs and guacamole to start and I think they're both must-orders. The kalbi ribs were deliciously tender and had a nice Korean bbq marinade (sweet, salty, tangy). The guac didn't last long, chips were a bit overly salted but actually when paired with the guac it was balanced. 

For tacos I had 1 crispy taco with braised short rib, and 1 baja fish. I loved both of them, but would probably pick the short rib over the baja fish next time even though it was quite messy. The shell didn't crumble as much as your old el paso would and the short rib jus had some deep flavour. Two of my colleagues had a crispy chicken taco and I was admittedly jealous - it will be ordered next time, they raved about it and it seemed to be a popular pick on other tables at the restaurant.

I found the service to be lacking, our waitress was hard to get a hold of and we waited quite awhile for drink orders to be taken and delivered once we had arrived (it was a pretty mean margarita though - not lacking on the tequila). 

Worth a visit if you like playa cabana!
Generally I feel this place is over rated.  Service is very lacking.  (I actually unloaded my car myself while 4 bellmen stood in shade 10 feet from me at the main entrance at check in).  Some area of the property need updating.  My room was "OK" but would like to see others.  Seemed over priced even during the off season.  The deck off my room was filthy with bird droppings, basically unusable.  Pools were nice but not clean. Rarely saw pool attendants. Pool towels available only at the main pool, with eight pools on property this seemed weird. Last day there I was asked to switch rooms as they had reserved my room for another quest.  Sorry not my problem, I had been there for a week!

Interestingly some people seemed to have bashed the spa here, I didn't think it was that bad., I would give it 4 stars.  

The high end restaurant in the place (can't remember name) is good but VERY pricey and with strange decor (I understand that is subjective, some people are really into the Frank Loyd look).  Anyhow, stayed a week and wouldn't return, too many option in this area at these prices.
I've been shish kabobed into this place .. amazing flavors, something new to me and the charcoal grill on the meats is awesome :)
Was good but not out of this world. Saw a few college students and business folks in the restaurant so it must be consistently good food.
I worked mostly with Becky in the party rentals dept for my wedding and she was great!  I rented table linens, chair covers & sashes, and pipe and drape.  She was very easy to keep in touch with and helped answer many of my questions.  I had originally planned on renting 4 outdoor heater for our ceremony which was in January, but called the day before to cancel them once I realized that the weather would be perfect and we wouldn't need them.  This saved me $200!  Becky had gone home sick that day so I spoke with Sheila and she was also very friendly and helpful.  The delivery guys brought everything to the venue 1st thing in the morning and since no one was really around to tell them where to set up the pipe and drape one of them gave me a call to inquire.  I don't recall his name but he was kind on the phone and understood my instructions.  In the end we were missing a table linen (not sure how) but Becky told me not to worry!  The pipe and drape provided wasn't as high as I was originally told but it turned out fine.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone!
Service is really slow here. I waited for over 25 mins just for takeout. Definitely not worth the wait. However, they seem to have live music Friday nites, so if you are looking for entertainment and food sit-in is probably a lot faster
Came here due to the great ratings and because I rarely find myself in the area.

This place has 2-star quality food and service. We had the Italian sausage pasta and the salmon pasta; both watery. 

This place gets an additional star for the prices which does increase the value of this place a bit.
Surly employees.  No spoon or napkins provided for to-go soup (I had to ask).  Tiny tiny portion of soup for bread bowl.  No cookie, but choice of an apple (ugh!), generic plain chips, or a baguette (rock hard hunk of bread).  Cream of chicken with wild rice soup was same as always, fine, and the bread bowl was edible.

I miss Paradise so much and apparently everyone else does too as it was absolutely dead inside, and plastered with help wanted signs, while Fired Pie and Los Taquitos are pulling in a brisk late dinner business.
I hiked to this peak a number of years ago. I recall it being quite a work out. I was in my mid 40s at the time and in fairly decent shape. This isn't a hike you'd want to do on a whim with no previous hiking experience.

It'll definitely have you gasping for breath and feeling the burn in your legs.

I do recall the climb was fairly straight forward meaning not much chance of getting lost. I recall climbing to the ridgeline then just following it to the summit.
A super floor store, with no other decor (do granite kitchen counter tops count?).  It can be slightly difficult to get an employee's help, but when you do, they have MUCH less attitude than, say, Lumber Liquidators, while also being MUCH more helpful than Lowes.  I will say the employees at Lumber Liquidators are somewhat more knowledgeable about their product line though, and that LL doesn't have ridiculously long wait times for special orders (I was quoted 8 months for one laminate at F&D!).

Their selection is gigantic.  It can definitely be overwhelming!  They have much more in stock than a Lowes or Home Depot or than what a small speciality store (LL) will carry.

Their selection of plain, decorative, and mosaic tile is enormous, plus they have some counter tops, marble, laminate, hardwood, slate, and everything you would need to install, seal, and clean.

Pricing is comparable to Lumber Liquidators on sale.  I definitely like the "always low price" warehouse aspect of it, compared to the "mark it up to sell it on sale" LL strategy.  However, they sell the pad to their laminate separately, while LL has it attached, and I can vouch for the quality of LL's product.

I would definitely recommend this store to anyone looking for any kind of tile or flooring.  The parking situation is very easy, as they took the former Mervyn's spot that always has plenty of parking off of Highland.
Went here for lunch.  It took them foreeeeeeeeever to serve the food.  We're talking 30 minutes to serve salads and soup when the restaurant is dead.  Pretty ridiculous.

Water glass was not kept full, and wasn't refilled for a good ten minutes despite me asking the server for it pointedly.  Waiter got one order incorrect.  Brother's steak took extremely long because the waiter said it wasn't well-done.

Coconut shrimp were small but tasted fine.  Potato soup was good, not too oniony.

Do NOT order any grilled chicken or fish.  It will be extremely dry.
Honestly very upset this place is closed. It was mine and my boyfriends all time favorite ramen place in the area. But it's been closed for basically this entire year, last time they were open was like March of 2017. Never gave any notice either. Just all the sudden closed. Reasoning on door was suspicious as well, claimed remodel and now moving locations? CONVINCED they closed because health care violations, frequently found dirty glasses and bowls or plates of food and even left over marks on forks. Tables were almost always sticky. Service is slow and thus makes the facility crowded and wait was always 20+ minutes
This teensy little Post Office does a roaring trade due to its super-central location, so don't be surprised if you have to line up outside. It doesn't provide passport forms and the like, so for your official document needs you will have to head elsewhere, but if all you want is a jiffy bag and to post a packet, this'll do you nicely. The staff are pretty perky too, which is jolly nice when you finally reach the front of the line.

It gets a bit crowded by the window where there's a writing shelf; if there's more than one person trying to juggle parcels or stick on some newly-purchased stamps prior to sending, elbows will be bound to jog one another. But that's just because the whole place is so weeny and cuuute!
Read an article online about this being the best gluten-free shop in Toronto. Not sure if I agree. They definitely have some interesting items like vegan, gluten free breads that I haven't really seen anywhere else. The store is much smaller than I thought it would be (based on what their website says). When I read their description of prepared foods and items in-store I was really excited about the variety. But once I found the store (which is hidden if you don't pay attention), I was disappointed. 

A lot of the other items they carry on the shelf can be found in various stores around Toronto at a way cheaper price too.

If you are in the neighbourhood, do go in and browse. Otherwise not really worth the drive up there.
Usually Yelp reviews are overly generous with there stars but in this case they are well deserved.  I don't come to Cleveland without eating here at least once!  I only wish it was in San Francisco.  Great hummus, Greek salad,  and tabbouleh.   Great lamb, nice deli atmosphere with wonderful long time employees and wait staff (I've been coming here for years).   I use them to cater parties and business meetings occasionally so check this out if you are interested, it is always a hit.
Early bird special Sun thru Thurs from 5pm till 6pm, $11.95. Ichiban! DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYTHING ELSE AFTER 6PM.
I my opinion, they are one of the best late night post drinking burrito joints. The are quaility for there type of restaurant, this is why I gave them five stars. They also have pepsi not coke. The are clean on the inside which is rare for a cheap mexican place.
I honestly do love Trader Joes because of the variety of people that patronize and work there.  I think the prices are decent, and since I am a vegetarian and try to live a healthy lifestyle, I generally am happy with Trader Joe's.  I wish it actually provided most of the things you need for everyday life (because we all know chocolate covered toffee isn't a necessity).  Other than that I am happy.
My husband and I came here for dinner before an event at Symphony Hall. The place is sparsely decorated but that didn't take away from the delicious dishes that were served.
We had the Pad Thai and a vegetarian dish with tofu.  Well prepared and full of flavor.
We also had the sweet rice with mango for desert which is a traditional favorite of mine.  It always helps when the waiter is cute too.  I remember thinking hmmm, his nice smile made the dinner more enjoyable.  
So maybe if you're not all that into Thai food . . . you can go in for the eye candy?
Visiting Las Vegas and need a Pho Fix? 
Tired of paying through the nose for flashy Casino Faux Asian food without authentic, down-home goodness? 

If you have a rental, venture up the strip and turn west on Spring Mountain (Circus Circus and Sahara, near Fashion Show Mall). Go about 2 blocks, and between Wynn Road and Decatur, you will find the asian shopping and restaurant district of LV. Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean, Malaysian, Taiwanese, you name it.!

Pho Saigon 8 is in this area. A large place seating up to 100 (25 tables of four). It must be run by the second generation, because it is clean, has quality decorative modern furniture, high ceilings, clean floors, computer POS terminals, and tasteful 18x24 art pieces of young Vietnamese women. Popular love songs, but no big screen DVD variety shows!

Their name implies they only serve Pho, but they serve a large array of typical Vietnamese dishes. Yes, Pho Bo (beef) and Pho Ga (chicken) ranging from $4.50 to $7.00; but also Hu Tieu and Mi (Pork or Seafood Soups with Rice or Egg Noodles $7.50),  Com Dia (Rice Plates $6.95 to $9.00), Bun (Vermicelli noodles including the popular  Bun Bo Hue, from $6.35 to $9.50) and deserts (3 types of Che) and drinks (i.e. Vietnamese coffee, coconut juice, plum soda, etc.)

The Pho was good, albeit the sprouts and basil were a little wilted. This is a pleasant atmosphere with pretty good food and acceptable service. Not sure what the 8 represents in Vietnamese. It might imply that the restaurant is run by Chinese, since 8 in that culture is good luck, and also refers to longevity, as in the popular myths of the 8 immortals.
I get my nails done here every two weeks and I really like their job! I get gel and it always lasts longer! My nails ways look good, never get cut during cuticle cleaning and the foot massage is awesome! Andy does an incredible pedi job and I adore getting mani from Helen!
*My daughter dropped and cracked our Ipad air this morning and i was calling around to find a best price to get it fixed. I stumbled upon this store in yelp search and their pricing was way better than any other shop I called to. I was  closer to their Tempe location,  and saw that their business has already 5 stars in mesa. I dropped it off with Alex in Tempe and after 2 hours came to pick it up. Ipad looks like new now, the screen is fresh without any fingerprints or dirt. Thank you so much, you have made my day. I will recommend you to all my friends! *
this place.

this place is just..  well its just awesome.

went there for the first time a couple weeks ago and i'm sorry that i'm just now writing this review, because i can't remember the name of the bartender, but let me tell you about what i DO remember - this guy was incredible.  he honestly made our experience unforgettable and because of him, we will most definitely be going back.  I didnt eat any food, but the 2 people i were with got pizzas, and they seemed to enjoy them.  then of course, there's the beer.  now, i'm not a huge beer drinker, but if i was, this place would be my go to.  sure there are other great places to grab a local (or not-so-local) beer, but how many of them are brewed and served inside of a church?  The inside of this place was incredible.  I loved how they kept the church feel to the building, but then, of course, there's all the beer.  

This place is just a really great, different kind of place to go grab a drink and some food, and, if your lucky, arguably the best bartender in PGH.
All of the bartenders are good-looking and super attentive. The food is expertly crafted and is consistently delicious. Each night boasts different events and specials, and it is the ideal spot for any craft beer lover. The place also has a humongous patio where one can enjoy their cigarettes with their extravagant beers and best friends.
Ugh... I don't want to write this review because I want to keep Mr. Tokyo off the map for selfish reasons. I've been twice now and both times were excellent. The price is so right (honestly, I think they should raise their prices!) and the quality is phenomenal. It's an AYCE style restaurant but you can also order a la carte. It really doesn't make sense not to do the AYCE option. Sushi lovers will be able to indulge in specialty rolls and sushi, while people who prefer their food cooked will have plenty of options too. 

The service is friendly and attentive. Just remember to eat all the food you order. They will charge you for any waste. 

Beware: The restaurant can get very busy but it is worth the wait!
Meh, I'll give it three stars.  I do not really recommend this place over C-Fu and Mekong unless distance is an issue.  I went to Great Wall around 1pm on Monday (a holiday, and they were pretty full) for dim sum,  I tried (using.the English\/American terms):
Rice cake
Bbq pork bun
Shrimp dumpling
Pork dumpling 
Coconut custard bun (the best item I ate)

Everything was decent.  Not amazing, not very warm and steamy, but just solid three star food.  The coconut custard bun\/bread was actually much better than C-Fu's though, which was a delight!

They were out of many things or only had two of something so you had to choose a third item of another type (which may be one you didn't care for).  I was unable to try the sesame seed balls and custard tarts because of this.  They also did not have a lot of what was on their takeout menu, but to be fair C-Fu only has their full selection on weekends, so maybe Great Wall follows this same practice.

There was nonexistent wait staff (since we only had dim sum and didn't order from the normal menu?), and we had to ask one of the cashiers\/hosts for water.  I was tempted to just grab a pitcher myself!  I actually did grab my own to go container (I do this all the time at C-Fu).  Some of the cart attendants\/servers were very nice, but a little difficult to understand.

Decently priced, but very sketchy location (their shopping center is pretty empty and anchored by a thrift store).  Lots of people (almost all Asian) were around and the immediate parking area was quite full though.  

At least it was almost right down the road from the business Costco, so I was finally able to go there (was tempted to check out Los Altos Ranch Market too, that's for next time though).
Lizzy was so wonderful and made my Brazilian so easy. Definitely recommend her for all your waxing needs!
Bizarre....je n'avais jamais été sur place pour un bagel...Moi qui adore les bagel..bref. Et bien, j'ai manqué quelque chose dans ma vie de Montréalaise. Ce sera la première visite de plusieurs à venir ..Bagel tout chaud, tout frais..pour moins de 1$. Ouvert 24h possibilité de garnir le bagel... (J'en veux un autre svp) Bref, à essayer absolument
The juice was massively overpriced and came in a tiny glass bottle, but even then it tasted so weird I didn't even drink it all. How can you mess up watermelon juice? It's watermelon; it should be delicious no matter what you do to it. The customer service basically amounted to telling the customer that she's wrong, cheap and fat and thus cannot possibly understand real juicing.
I've been a member here since they opened and Dustin always greets and guides me into the car wash tunnel. What a friendly guy, who has customer satisfaction and service as his number one priority. I feel appreciated as a customer each time I come through, because of him. Not to mention, the wash itself is always superb, and the endless free vacuuming is a major perk. They maintain their equipment and constantly upkeep the interior cleaning area by keeping the trashes emptied and garbage cleaned up. Highly recommend!
It was the first time I used the check-in kiosk, and it was a breeze! The line of people waiting to rent from a counter person had a 45 minute to 1 hour wait, but using the kiosk I was in my rental car & out the door in about 15 minutes. I'll definitely rent from Alamo again!!
I have been to Hub Sushi on a few occasions. What keeps me coming back is their yummy pressed sushis and tasty rolls. However, service has not been consistent. On our most recent visit the service was the most disappointing. We had to ask for menus and generally the servers were not friendly. We were there on a Friday night and restaurant was packed.  Also heard a few patrons say that they had reservations but still waited for 30 minutes. When we brought up the issues we had with service to the owner, they mentioned that there is some new staff and still under training. We will see how things go on our next visit.
Great customer service with consistent and frequent showtimes. Love it!
Viva Chicken is totally one of my favorite places in Charlotte. I love everything about them. Their food is amazing. They have super friendly service a Amazing food + friendly service + awesome value = 5 stars! I'm a pollo a la brasa junkie... Something about the seasoning and slow roasting just makes that chicken irresistible. Add the Huacatay & Roasted Rocoto Sauce and I'm in heaven! The quarter chicken plate ($7.95, $5.95 for lunch!) is more than enough food for me. I love the sweet potato fries and salad. The feta cheese and sweet\/tangy dressing make the salad. I would highly recommend trying the purple corn punch and the passion fruit punch. Both are delicious! They also serve beer & wine. Parking is free and plentiful across the street. I can't wait to explore more of their menu!
I used to live in Scottsdale, but farther north, so I shopped at the Trade Joe's on Frank Lloyd Wright. It was pretty new, in a newer big block mall, near Inn n Out burger, Red Fish, and the Promenade center.

This Trader Joe's is farther south, between McDonald and Lincoln, next to the Borgata Shopping center and across from the Hilton Village.

It has double entry ramps going up gently from either side to a middle entry door, which is great for those on mobility scooters or wheelchairs. 

The selection is pretty typical of most TJ's, with nothing notably different or missing. 

I got a large bag of Pistachios (salted, in shell) for $5.29, and a Very Green Juice drink for $2.29.

Pretty good selection of wine here than most TJs. 

Lots of room for parking.
Legacy Golf Resort was hands down my husband (swoon) and my, one and only choice for our wedding March of 2017. Not just because of the beautiful outdoor options they had available but mainly because of Kelli the wedding coordinator and her team of hard working dependable individuals, Britt you're also a rockstar! Not only was the day every bit as perfect as we imagined but it went off without a hitch! Any problem that could have potentially arisen or did arise, was immediately handled and solved by Kelli and her team before my husband and I even knew what happened. Kelli was not only a day of coordinator, she helped us throughout the whole process from the minute we walked onto the property a year ago. She instantly made us feel like we were the most important people on the planet and did everything in her power to grant every wedding wish. You could never select a better venue that truly wants to help make your wedding day the best day of your life. Kelli and the Legacy team, we are forever grateful for your beautiful property and making our wedding day a day we will never forget.
This is our go-to ramen spot. Close to home, small family restaurant, and obviously...great ramen (and that's all). What do I mean? Only order the ramen, everything else is just 'okay'. I've ordered takoyaki and gyoza and was not blown away. It passes if you are craving it but you will be fully satisfied with your bowl of ramen. Other yelper pics are accurate pictures of what the place and food looks like:) My favourite ramen is the Tonkatsu and Netsu. Piping hot and chewy noodles swimming in piping hot soup. Service can be a bit slow (it is a family business) but we love it here, it's been consistent so far and we go here at least a few times each month. Definitely check it out if you're in the area.
One of my fav spots in Henderson\/GVR for the atmosphere and the food is fairly tasty. Great place to grab a drink and chill with friends. cool seating for dining and at the bar. Definitely upscale and different from most Sammys.
I have since switched hairdressers and am going elsewhere. Angela continued doing a fine job, but it was always the same. Very busy and always a bit sloppy. For example, no one ever put colour protector around my head, so you'd always end up with dye all over your skin and ears. They would send you home with some dye remover wrapped in tin foil, to wipe it away. This sort of stuff can be overlooked if the job is excellent, but it was always just good. Finally, I decided to see if I couldn't do better elsewhere. Still looking for that perfect hairdresser though.
Where to begin. My husband has had back pain on and off for quite sometime now.  Back in November it got to the point that he could barely walk.  We went and saw our primary doctor (Tom Peters) who was great.  Took lots of time with us to answer questions and note history.  We left there feeling better like we were finally going to get some answers.  He had my husband go for an MRI and got us in immediately after to go over.  He found a few things that were of concern to him and suggested we go to a specialist.  He recommended Dr. Bassewitz.  I had actually heard some great things about him from other people so we were happy about that.  That brings us to today.  

My husband got to the appointment (9:50am) and they did an X-Ray on his back.  Then they put him in a room for 2 hours!!!!!  No one comes in to check or anything.  The doctor finally arrives with some story about Govt mandate.  Sorry we have had an appointment for weeks, perhaps that appointment could have been the one to wait for 2 hours????  

So after all that, he must have been ready for lunch as he only spent all about 5 minutes to say, "sorry nothing there, you have a normal back for your age" and dismissed him!!!!  

How disappointing!!!  Is it normal to have constant pain?????????  I would NEVER recommend this doctor to anyone.  My next call will be back to Dr. Peters to also share the experience with them so they don't think this is the place to send their patients.  It was a complete waste of time and just horrible that a Dr. can make someone feel like they just don't care.  You make your patient wait 2 hours and you cannot even afford 20 minutes to sit with them?????????  HORRIBLE
Really like the feel of the place. Cool contempo styling. The food portions are small compared to other spots but then again this is Vegas lol. I have tried a number of items here and its all pretty good. Not a bad option for healthy ish food in Green Valley Ranch.
We were here on a holiday Monday where nothing much was open. We had to grab some takeout as we were in a rush and this was the only place open.

We ordered:
- beef noodle soup
- grilled pork chop rice
- grilled port vermicelli 

The food was ok, nothing exciting and kind of bland.
I've been here a few times since I first went in December, and I've enjoyed it every single time.  I love love LOVE the vegetarian options available here.  I've been to their other locations in town, but this one has the added benefit of not being on the Strip, and it's closer to where I live.  The service is always great, and the food is always delicious.  I've tried different things on the menu, and can vouch for everything I've tried.  I've never had one of my friends not enjoy what they had, either.  This will be a frequent haunt, and I'll be sure to bring people (vegetarian or otherwise) back to enjoy one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!
J'aime le casino de Montréal, même si je n'y met pas les pieds souvent. On peut se promener sans gaspiller un sous, voir les gens qui jouent. Il y a souvent de l'animation et un dancefloor! Il y a des jolis petits bar un peu partout! Et bien-sûre on peu boire du  café et des boissons non alcoolisé GRATUITEMENT :D yeeah
Since I moved to Glendale, I come here mainly for my nail services. They're usually pretty busy, but worth the wait as service is great. I will say that Andy can be kind of rude sometimes though, but my nails look fantastic. Lots of color options, priced decent and they're clean.
Decent boba tea though not as good as others I have tried and reviewed in Vegas. Both the Hokkaido milk tea and taro slushy don't quite reach the gold standard. Friendly service. Location is a bit dicey with panhandler firmly planted outside the door. Too bad I will have to drive a lot further to get the cream of the crop.
I went in so excited because I've never been in one of these stores before and I love golf. We'll let me tell you, I practically had to beg people to help me. Maybe it's because I wasn't buying anything. I had lots of questions but only wound up asking a few because I didn't want to feel like a nuisance. I'll be shopping at Dicks from now. They're way more helpful and a lot friendlier.
Glad I made it before it closed.  Of course this review is late comings, but still!  

All the employees were very nice.  I politely declined the $1 upgrade of my popcorn size though.

The theater was what I remember as a kid, the downward sloping style (as opposed to the built up arena style).  The sound system and screen were just fine.  I liked that I could sir in the back and get a good view (which I am sure is more difficult when there's a packed house).

Hopefully the "new" Camelview inside Fashion Square will continue the legacy.  Love my commemorative pin!
3 1\/2 stars. Wanted to like the food even more than I did. It was good. In some cases better than good. Just not great. Great hand made strawberry lemonade. Poutine was solid. The chicken was tender but didn't have a lot of flavor w flavorful cornbread. Filet\/sirloin was prepared well med rare and was solid but i didn't care for it being slightly blackened. The veal reduction sauce was different, didn't hate it but didn't love it. The peach salad was good and Id get it again. The peach cobbler wasn't bad. I'll come back because I like supporting the downtown project and its a cool location with cool atmosphere. Liked sitting at the bar and watching the kitchen.
After spending 5 hours in the airport and 5 hours on a bumpy flight, I finally landed in Las Vegas. Since I was traveling for about 10 hours (or more) I was starving for something other than airport food. I didn't know where to go, so I turned to my friend who is stationed out here to bring me somewhere good and low-key. He picked a great place! We started off with guacamole and two different kinds of salsa. The guacamole was really really good! It was the second best I have ever had. We then had the beef quesadilla, which were also very good. Super cheesy, and the beef was extremely tender. 

Oh and if you are going to get a drink (which you are since you are in Vegas) get the pitcher of red sangria.....So Delicious!!!!!
My fav yoga spot!! Ever!! I have been going for a year and I just love it so much ! Katie and Sarah are my favs, but really the whole staff is excellent. Very relaxing and calming environment and everyone is so nice and welcoming. My strength and flexibility have increased so much and the staff are always eager to help you with your poses.  My favorite studio in Vegas, and I have tried a few.
I had lunch yesterday (6\/20\/15) ...ordered the "All you can eat" because it was a great deal for 21.95. It was just my son and myself and we ordered 4 rolls. When the Server came to clear our plates she informed us of a $10.00 per person charge if we didn't finish the sushi left on our plates. ????? I could understand if we had ordered 10 different rolls and not finished them. But we ordered 4 rolls for 2 people, that's not excessive. (had 1 piece of each left on 2, one plate was gone and the last plate had 6 pieces because we didn't like it). The Server stated that if we ate 2 more pieces she would not charge us, so of course we did. I wont be returning to Kaizen and wanted to let others know about this so they aren't embarrassed like I was by an insane charge.
Best cab service I've used in Phoenix. Reliable, great car, nice driver.
If you have ample time to spare (60-90 mins minimum) then you should be fine dining here. I've eaten here twice and both times were just okay. The ramen isn't extraordinary, but it's filling. Burgers are good and cooked according to taste. I ordered pick up once and they said it'd be ready in 30 mins. One hour later I got my order (1 burger, gyoza, ramen). The broth was cold and it was unusually salty. Dine in was slow and it's hard to get the attention of staff. Definitely could use improvement in the customer service area, because food usually tastes well.
This is more of a warning than a review.  The place is great, get a sunset reservation, enjoy the bar, food is good to excellent, and bring your wallet.  Others have said it all here.  My warning is DO NOT SPEED ON E. MCDONALD!!!  It is a complete Paradise Valley "speed trap" in the truest sense of the word!  I was tagged with a mobile photo ticket  van parked just down hill from the entrance to the restaurant.  They basically set it up to catch unsuspecting tourist going to the Sanctuary.  The valet guys were aware of it and said they do it all the time.  Despite the bummer of the start to my evening and the additional expense it added (Probably a $600 night with ticket) I still enjoyed dinner there and would recommend it.  I think my date wasn't too happy with me as I wasn't exactly in a great mood, this was my third AZ (read points on license) photo ticket in 6 months (all less than 15 over).... total money grab rip off!
Our server Charlie was great! Soo informative about the menu and on top of everything. Great relaxing atmosphere and not ridiculously priced. Only problem is parking, like anywhere in old town. Definitely worth checking out!
Im a sucker for gadget and doodads. Everything looks so orginazed and neatly displayed. Yet when I get it home it's still a mess.
Came here at 9pm on a Tuesday and had the whole place to ourselves. I got the pecan bar, my husband got the seasonal blueberry lemonade. Both were unique, and packed a lot of fresh flavor. The pecan is a good sweet\/savory flavor while the blueberry lemonade was tart and refreshing. 
It was clean, well kept, and the cashier was super friendly. I left feeling like my sweet tooth was totally satisfied without the fatty feeling you get after Ice cream. I can already predict what I will be craving the next time I get pregnant. Paletas!
No self park but free valet (during the day park across the street @ Macy's if you want self park).

Dining is pricey but food is good.

TV has no premium movie channels and remote is old some reception issues.

Staff is friendly, standard no problems there.

All in all a comfortable experience with great prices and no smoking. Perfect!

*think this is my 4th or 5th stay here holding up nicely...
J'y suis aller vers 1h30 am...on cherchait un endroit pour finir la soirée.... Super ambiance. Le staff est le fun. La déco style beer garden j'adore. J'y retournerai certainement pour y fêter jusqu'à 3h. Attention après 2h30 ils ne laissent rentrer personne. Les drinks sont de prix raisonnables et pas de cover à l'entrée. Bonne musique.
I first visited Penzey's in the strip district in Pittsburgh and I had no idea there was one in the valley until just a few months ago.  Penzey's is wonderful if you like to cook.  Heck, it is wonderful if you just like interactive shopping.  Most of the available spices and herbs are set out in jars so that you may open the lid and give it a good sniff before purchasing.  You can tell a lot about a spice and how it will enhance your food just from one good smell.

The prices are beyond reasonable, the selection is great, and they even have their own spice mixes which are wonderful.  I recently picked up their "Mural of Flavor"  and it is so versatile, so tasty and contains NO salt.  As the previous reviewer stated, this place is wonderful for someone who is trying to use less salt in their food but does not want to give up any flavor.

You can get spices in small containers here, so you never have to worry about buying too much and having it go bad.  There are also plenty of extracts and goodies for bakers as well as many gift sets.

If you like fresh and inexpensive spices and herbs, Penzey's may be your new favorite store.
It was a busy night, so they told us about a 30 minute wait. Ok, no problem, we just went over to the bar for some drinks to burn some time. The problem though was the fact that we walked by several open tables that suited our group size. We just wrote it off to maybe being down a server. That was until they sat us forty minutes later at one of those very tables that was open when we walked in.

The bartender was good. He moved quickly and was on top of things. He also worked with our server to transfer our tab to our table. A simple thing that many places will not do so it was appreciated.

Our server at the table was also good. He came by often and was friendly. His visits got a little too space out toward the end, but overall it was good.

There are plenty of televisions to catch the game, or many games for that matter. There is a large bar area and a lot of regular seating as well. They had a live band in later in the evening. I am normally ok with this at a bar, but it confuses me at a sports bar. Especially with so many great 8pm games on. Also for whatever reason it was very warm inside. It was slightly crowded at times, but not enough to justify the excessive heat.

The food was ok. I ordered 8 boneless wings in the flaming Parmesan sauce. The sauce had decent flavor, but was certainly not flaming. The wings were large, but slightly over cooked. Not burnt, but overly crisp.

I also ordered the Steel Town Spuds with tater tots. You get a good sized portion. The tots come topped with ranch dressing, bacon, scallions and melted cheese. The flavor was ok. They brought out some buffalo sauce to dip it in and that made it much better.
Disregard the outside. The food is VERY good Indian food!!  I highly recommend this place.  I have had Indian food in the best of restaurants (London) and this place is quite good.  You will be impressed if you like Indian\/Pakistani type food!
It's slap bang on the Royal Mile, so this must be one of the busiest Starbucks branches in the world in August, but somehow they keep on serving efficiently and effectively. It's normally pretty busy in the morning too - coffee rush hour, unsurprisingly - but their morning supervisor is a delight. He welcomes every single new queue member through the door with a smile, takes names and orders on arrival and lines up the neatly labelled cups for the baristas to fill assiduously in sequence. There have been times when I've felt like I really must be the highlight of his day, only to see him greet those who arrive behind me with equal geniality. That's service with a smile, folks.

You know what Starbucks serves and what it costs. Well, this is a Starbucks, so it's got all that. What this branch in particular has to recommend it is a very fine people-watching vantage point. Most of the seating is upstairs (the downstairs is little bigger than the queue and serving area) in what feels like an old library. From a seat by the plentiful windows there, you can see Hunter Square, most of the way down Cockburn Street and a good portion of the Mile itself.

If, like me, you like to sit with a hot choc and watch the world go by, there aren't many finer spots to do it, especially if you like the people you watch to be buzzing around along beautiful uneven streets cobbled with history.

They've got to know me by name in there now I think; although they know me as Mary. Spelling out my unconventional name just holds up the queue...
The experience started out great.  I saw they had philly cheesesteak nachos and I had to try them.  Order the large portion if you have more than two people.  There was plenty of cheese.  They even used Cheese Whiz like a true Philly sandwhich.  There was plenty of cheese, but very little meat.  After eating off the top few chips the meat was gone.  They really need to double the meat.

For dinner I attempted to order the BLT, but they were out of bacon.  I settled for the chicken strips.  It was your standard issue chicken strip meal.  Not bad, but I could do the same on my own from the frozen food section at any grocery store.

Our server was nice, and attentive.  That was easy though because the place was nearly empty.
Pros: bathroom and linens were clean, and the rooftop pool was beautiful and relaxing after a long day of walking 

Cons: the layout of the hotel is a little goofy (and less than fun after a long day of walking when you're ready to collapse on your bed) and we sighting a few aunts on the carpeting.
I have yet to step foot inside of Lulu's but I have tasted their cupcakes and they are delicious. I am a fan of cake and cupcakes, but I am not a fan of the store bought product that is so overly sweet I feel like I might develop diabetes after one bite.  So my brother picked some Lulu's cakes up for me as I had mentioned reading about the new bakery  in the new Phoenix Metropolitan magazine.  The cupcakes they serve are all natural, but this does not mean they are not sweet, fluffy, and full of flavor.  I tried the "Bunny Boo" which is a carrot cake cupcake covered in cream cheese butter cream icing.  It even had a tiny sliver of carrot and I believe a sprig of parsley on the top to mimic a real carrot.  The cake was flavorful with nice pieces of walnut and the icing was light and fluffy and there was a generous amount of it.  I have a chocolate cupcake with vanilla butter cream icing sprinkled with coconut that I will be having at lunch and I cannot wait.

 I am also a sucker for packaging and my 4 cupcakes came in a pretty pink box with a brown ribbon around it.  The price is a little high for a single cupcake ($2.95) but sometimes you have to splurge to get a quality item.  If you buy four it is $10.00.

They are only open 8:30am - 5:30pm, so plan your visit accordingly.
Seriously??? This is what everybody is raving about? The chicken has absolutely NO seasoning whatsoever. It is just bland fried chicken strips. The fries remind me of the frozen crinkle cut fries you buy at the supermarket. Then they serve it with a thick piece of buttered white bread, I'm assuming that is an attempt at Texas toast. Come on man!

The atmosphere is reminiscent of a high school cafeteria. It is very noisy in there. The funny thing is all of the noise is coming from the staff in the kitchen.

This is why I rarely frequent fast-food establishments. I definitely will not be back.
After bouncing from spot to spot for years looking for a place that could keep my locs tight and proper without success, I stumbled upon the Caribbean Braiding Salon in the East Valley their second location and became an immediate fan. Not only is the spot professional and courteous, the talents of Mrs. Gail, Sherman and the rest of their staff is exceptional.  The place is warm friendly with personable staff that cares about their work quality. Each latch is done with such care; it is like they are creating art. If you are looking for place that is punctual, down to earth with genuine people look no further. Peace!
Convenient location but not so great if you try to mail things during peak hours. I went in to post things during the holidays and they only had one window open! I wish they had a self-service machine. The plus... They saved me a TON of money. UPS quoted me $131 to send a package for guaranteed Christmas Eve delivery. USPS only charged me $22.
Finding good chicken that's cooked fresh and not fried is hard. That's why I love el pollo loco. I can get a chicken bowl without rice to get shreds and keep these gainz brah. 

I go here all the time. Order food, get food, eat food, fart in car, and go about my day. Why would someone write a yelp review for a fast food joint? That's because it was special today. An el pollo loco employee's customer service display wowed me. 

This young man seemed to love his job. He genuinely seemed to love it. I can see him becoming a CEO of something someday. I hope gets a scholarship or something. Usually it's busy when I go in. He helped us with a smile, tried to upsell with a smile. We sat down ate our food. It was slow and I watched him clean the dining room, cleaned the salsa station, and came by out table and asked if he can take our empty tray and take care of it for us. He did and I looked at his name tag. I was really appreciative that he did that, at a fast food place.

Wow. I hope his bosses see this and tell him about this yelp review. Patrick you are the man.
We attended a birthday party of about 40 people here. We were prepared to wait a little while for food given the size of the event, so that was fine, took about an hour after ordering to get our meals (once people who had ordered appetizers had eaten)
My boyfriend ordered fettuccine Alfredo with chicken, and it was bland and had the consistency of paste. He asked for extra chicken in it and received about 4 morsels total.
I ordered chicken parmigiana, with a side of spaghetti. The sauce was very acidic, and the potion of spaghetti was less than a tin of chef Boyardee. And my chicken, while a decent size, was burned to a crisp. Didn't bother sending it back as I didn't want to wait another hour. 
Was not impressed.
Without a doubt great Tea and fresh drinks.

The service is great.
The business is clean.
The range of tea and other drinks are extensive.
And quality of product is high!

They make everything with fresh fruits and juices. This place is pretty legit.

52 different drinks are made here with fresh boba. I've seen them with buckets of fruit and vegetables slicing and dicing. From seeing this it made me feel I was getting what I paid for. No purée or other garbage is thrown in.

Also it's a family run business.....
I recently dined at Sazon Bachata.  Visiting from out of town and in search of places to dance Bachata, I Googled "Bachata Phoenix AZ". To my surprise, this restaurant was listed.  The name caught my attention.  I was thoroughly pleased!  The food was DELICIOUS! The family owned staff were extremely warm and pleasant.  I felt as though I were dining with family. I ordered Pollo Guisado, but it wasn't available. The young girl who took my order suggested I try the bistec instead. I ordered the bistec with arroz blanco, habichuelas and maduros.  Then, I topped it off with a morir sonando for the road.  I was also given information on Dominican places to dance Bachata.  Looks like I'll have a lot to do on my next visit.  Oh yes, there will definitely be a next time.  Much success to Sazon Bachata!
I appreciate that Manpuku serves different variations of Japanese cuisine. If you are looking for alternatives to the abundance of sushi restaurants in downtown Toronto, or on a budget and looking for a quick meal, I suggest you give this place a try.

-Takowasa - $3.99: If you don't know what Takowasa is, it's a bowl of chopped raw octopus smothered in a "pickled" wasabi sauce. The octopus was chewy, but hard, slimy (in a good way) and full of wasabi heat. I doubt the restaurant used fresh wasabi for this dish, as the octopus was extremely spicy and left this "burning" aftertaste in my mouth. So really, I wish they would have served this with seaweed, as the salty seaweed would help to cut down the spiciness. 

-Chawan Mushi - $3.99: Chawan mushi is an egg-custard dish, and when made properly the egg should have a silky and barely set, or quivering texture. This Chawan Mushi was quite different, in terms of texture, from a chawan mushi that I had previously. This was really watery and too bland for my taste, I don't recommend it at all.

-Hotate rice (Rice bowl topped with scallop and egg) - $8.99: the hotate rice tasted just like an okonoyami on top of rice. Also, there weren't many pieces of scallop, anyhow it was $9, I don't think you can expect much

-Salami Curry - $6.49: Manpuku's signature curry sauce on a bed of rice, with toppings such as pan-fried salami, ketchup, mayo -  sounds like a weird combination but somehow it works! The curry had a thicker texture than other curries I have had before, and the ketchup sweetened up the curry. The salami provided some saltiness and spicy to the dish, which in turn added a great depth of flavor that's unique to the curry
I got the nachos with carne asada. There was nothing to them. No beans, rice, salsa etc and they were gross
This place has changed names so many times but this was the most "updated" name of the venue I could find. It's current name is Ak-Chin Pavilion. Anyways, I came here for the first time to see Gavin DeGraw\/The Script\/Train last night. I read all the horrible reviews and was a little nervous coming here. We came about an hour before the concert and had no problem with finding the place, parking, getting in or finding a place on the lawn to sit. In my opinion, drinking a beer and being on the lawn was a really wonderful way to enjoy a summer night. The sound and stage set ups for all the bands were really great and thought they put on a great show! The only downside for me was the fact that everything was extremely overpriced. I paid $12 for a beer and water was a whopping $7.50! I would suggest bringing your own water and eating beforehand. The marijuana smoking on the lawn was also a small issue so if you are sensitive to that, beware. Overall, had a great time and would definitely return!
I'm not on the Poutini's train. It's fine but I've had way better in Toronto.

The main issue is the temperature of the gravy - it's not hot enough! The cheese curds remain completely unmelted. It's also not the most rich in flavour. 

My husband loves it so I've had it many times over the years and it is always the same. 

What I do like is the availability of fresh ground pepper, and the option of layering your poutine. 

I'd rather a poutine from Big Smoke Burger any day. If you haven't tried it, give it a go. Gravy is dark dark brown and you get some meltage.
We've known Buck since early 2015 and in that time, he's photographed our family multiple times. Not only is he a ridiculously talented guy, he's super nice and so easy to work with. Family shoots are not the easiest ventures. With kiddos running around and occasionally being uncooperative, Buck is patient and really takes the time to make everyone comfortable. We've never felt rushed or on the clock with him. That is a unique quality in a photographer and has made for some great experiences!

We originally synced up with him to start documenting our little one's growth. From 3 months old and onward, he's given our family the precious gift of immortalized memories. With reasonable pricing, a quick turnaround, and stellar customer service, hiring Buck to photograph your family\/event is a no-brainer.

PS. When Back to the Future becomes a reality, I'll travel in time and hire Buck as our wedding photographer. Wedding advice #1 - don't skimp on this piece. Check out his portfolio and you'll see he's da best.
Food is very good! Came in for soondubu and that was good but too salty. The pork bone soup is fantastic and the banchans were very good too! I would definitely come back to try more on the menu! Please be mindful that they are very under staffed and they are trying their best to accommodate to everyone, the women are very nice people. Just be patient.
I think maybe it is because this is an older store but I'm not super impressed with this Frys's compared to others. Having said that, I still frequent this store and I will go here over Basha' any day of the week. The store seems to be stocked adequetly and the customer service is good. Not great, not horrible either.
The quality of the food is great, they are specialized in goat cheese. It is a convenient place for a romantic supper or a diner at lunch break! I would totally recommend this place, if you are a cheese addict, this is the place to be. Watch out on weeknights for opening hours, Thursday and Friday it is opened later.
Not impressed. As another Yelper said, she found herself anticipating the opening of this place, only to find that upon going, the experience was not what she'd anticipated. I had a paneer sandwich--which is Indian cheese, vegetables and sauce rolled up in naan. I agree with the Yelper who said this place is like an Indian version of Piada. The prices are steep for what you get, in my opinion. The size of my sandwich was normal--it wasn't like I was "stuffed" after eating it. The mango lassi was expensive -- $3.45 or $3.95, and was just okay. It was missing a key ingredient: rosewater--an essential component in a quality lassi. Anyhow--I think my bill was just below $12 for dine-in. 

The people were kind and friendly though, and I thought it was cool that you could see the naan being cooked through the glass wall. Food is expensive these days, unfortunately. Maybe with a few tweaks, this place will improve over time.
I feel like you can never get an appointment with this facility. It also feels like they want you in and out extremely quick so they can take as many customers they can that day instead of spending time with each patient and caring. Their appointments are always weeks out and I just feel like a number instead of a person when I'm there. There are other, better businesses in the valley that you can find on Yelp. That's what I did and I've never been happier. They also haven't responded back to me in regards to getting my records.
Hidden next to pork and beans, this window coffee was pretty good.

Ordered a mocha and it was fast and fresh.
Customer service was polite and helpful.
Quick and easy
I loved their intricate coffee types and decor that looked very eco friendly. I wish I had known that this location was so close to the lake earlier on during the summer so I could have enjoyed it but nonetheless I will definitely be grabbing a cup of coffee to go, bundling up and walking along the lake!
Overpriced and overhyped. The margherita pizza was forgettable. If you can't get that simple pizza right, then you have to wonder. The honey pie was much more successful. Would order that one again. It's a party spot more than anything, so it helps if you're drunk. You might enjoy the pizza more that way.
A friend invited me and I had a blast!  The ladies across from us were a force of fun!  Helpful staff and Enjoyable time!  I was pleasantly surprised:)
I want to give this place 4 stars but I can't, and if they were to rethink their punch card policy, I would consider changing my review.  More on that later.

I've had a multitude of items here.  The shining items are the solar-ray shot, the green anna bread smoothie (it tastes like banana bread), the Redhead Irish Juice (one of my favorites), and the Beet Goes On juice.  They had a Pecan Pie smoothie in the fall that was really really good.  The Racer's Edge Smoothie didn't taste like anything to me.  The Brain On shot that I got...I felt I was shorted.  There was probably 1\/2 ounce in the glass when I paid for a 1 ounce shot.  The kid working asked his coworker if they had more of the second ingredient in the shot...  I definately think I was shorted there.  

The staff is friendly enough.  It seems they prefer to talk to the Sewickley parents more than anything which is fine.  I like that they added the option off adding "extras" to the smoothies--kale, spinach, alge.  

My main complaint is their punch-card system.  It took me three separate visits to ask if I had a punch card.  They have a punch card where, after 12 punches, you earn a free menu item.  Along the way, you earn free health shots (after punch 4 and punch 8).  I like that aspect of the punch card especially given the price point of the place.  

The problem is this--one day I stopped in and ordered a smoothie for myself and a smoothie for my sister (who was with me).  The girl working only punched my card once.  She got pretty short with me and said "it's per transaction".  Interesting... definately is not stated on the card, so I asked her to break up the purchases into two transactions.  She continued to be short and said "It's per transaction per visit".... Interesting definately not stated on the card, but punched my card for the second time.  If it were a free coffee card where the value of the coffees and punches were around $2, I would not really be concerned with this but if you consider that you could be buying a smoothie each time you are in and ultimately have to buy 12--after your 12th visit you get "Free Menu Item" then there is some value there.  The scenario changes when you present your punch card and if you buy more than one item, you only get one punch, the value of what they are providing you "for free" greatly lessens.  I guess my point is, if they are going to put restrictions on how they are going to use the card, then they ought to be explicit on the card.  Their website also has no information on the program so there is no way to know.    But perhaps that why I wasn't offered one the first three times I went into the store and why no one mentions it?
While the restaurant was gorgeous and the staff was well trained, I must say for the price you are paying I expect to get super fresh tasting fish. I ordered the chirashi (my go to dish at sushi places when I am not sharing) And while the portion was decent,  the tuna and octopus both tasted slightly off, like it was old. The other fish on the plate,  while fresh, just didn't have a lot of flavor. In short you pay a lot for pretty average fish, almost 1.5-2x what I would pay for the quality I recieved(depending on the dish)  there are many better places in the area, that have tastier fish and are a bit more reasonably priced.
Writing a review of All Paws presents a real dilemma to me. I looked forward to the shop opening, as it was replacing a failing business in the shopping center. When it opened initially as All Wags - there has now been a falling out with the owners of All Wags and they've started operating this store independently - I visited, got to know the people working there and pledged to come back often for purchases.

Unfortunately, I can't do that anymore because All Paws simply won't order the cat food that I need. The first few times I was in, they carried Acana Grasslands, although it was in a small bag. I asked them to order the 15# bag and picked it up once it came in stock. They stock the Acana line, but they don't seem to carry the large bag of Acana Grasslands. My cats have digestive issues, so switching their food is not an option. I have told them many times that they have a guaranteed purchase from me, once a month, of this product - if they will only order it.

My frustration really has begun in the last month, as I've gone in and asked them to order Acana Grasslands 15# cat food three times. Each time they say they'll do it, but the call never comes. The second time I went in I was sure they must have ordered it (it had been two weeks since I'd stopped by to ask) and they still had not ordered it. I was promised it would be ordered "in the next week". I heard the same story again on my third visit to check if they had ordered my food. I don't understand how they can stock Acana, but can't order this flavor for me. Meanwhile, if I had waited on them to order the food, my cats would have starved by now.

With no other options, I finally had to cave and order online. I found a place where I can order Acana Grasslands at a competitive price - actually about a dollar less than what they were selling it for - with free shipping, so long as I order two bags. I really wanted to support a local retailer, but it seems All Paws isn't interested in selling me cat food.

I wish All Paws all the success in the world. The two stars is because their grooming services are fantastic, but I am really very disappointed that they never even made an effort to order the food that I need for my pets, even after they told me that it would be no problem.
I don't even like Mexican food that much to begin with... But I don't mind repeating this place every week.  Why I think Zaba's tastes so much better than other (Americanized) tacos joint... Like Qdobas, Chipotle, or Baja Fresh... I don't really know. I can't explain. I guess I am just madly in love with their unique recipe ? I must also add that quality of the food is fairy consistent here, which gives me peace of mind. Just a little F.Y. I. I just had jalapeño poppers for the first time, and I am ready to drive back there for some more :)
I drive by this place every morning on the way to work. Its a very cool place to stop, even with 4 cars in front of me I don't feel like I waited in line like I did at a Starbucks drive-thru, because once you pull up to the window there are always super happy baristas happy to take your order and talk to you while they make it. I walked up once and saw that their coolers had Dutch Bro stickers on them and since I always talk about this place I asked how much they were, they trew a box full of stickers in front of me and told me to pick out what I wanted. So now I promote 24-7. Oh and for sure get the punchcard for free drinks and sign up for the email\/text list because they always have specials.
How can you not seriously love this place? For real. I dare any of you to tell me otherwise, and then I will make fun of you and call you lame. I've been to Lo-Lo's several times, and it's about time I inform everyone of their amazing treat of chicken and waffles. And the red kool-aid. Don't deny it. I don't care if you are 75. You still crave you some kool-aid every now and then. And now you can have it. With dinner. In a jar. And mom and dad can't even yell at you. 

The atmosphere and location are both real and authentic. Expect to feel like you are in grandma's house, sitting somewhere near the kitchen and waiting for some amazing southern food. 

I always want to try the red velvet cake or the mac and cheese but I can never get past the tre tre.... 2 fried chicken legs and a waffle and that's all it takes for my stomach to be full.

Be warned they only take cash here, but it's worth it.
Another pit stop at a local bakery around my work, I'm going to get fat soon. Anyway, saw the previous review by Kat on this hidden little bakery that's really close to my workplace, so I decided to stop by after having watched an episode of Cake Boss last night and feeling the need for a cannoli. I shake my first at you Buddy Valastro, darn you for destroying my diet!

Cordi has freshly baked Caldenese bread, rye bread, bagels, croissants, and an assortment of Italian pastries including cannolis, chocolate cannolis, zeppole, cinnamon buns, cakes and whatnot.  They also had a deli section which had a few people ordering from.

I picked up a cannoli, a chocolate cannoli, a cinnamon bun and a zeppole. 

My virgin experience with a zeppole, so I can't really compare, but it the zeppole is SUPER creamy, sort of like a donut with massive amounts of cream and cheese. It was alright. I'll have to try out zeppole at some other bakeries to really compare. 

The cannolis had a crunchy shell and creamy filling with chocolate chips.  A nice crunchy shell (nothing worse than a soggy\/soft shell on a cannoli) but the shell was a bit too thick for my liking. All in all it was good though. 

The cinnamon bun was average, nothing to rave about and comparable to what you could get at other bakeries or a supermarket. 

I'll have to try the caldenese bread next time, which looked pretty good and the cherry and apple turnovers, but I'll save those calories for another day.

Off first impressions, I prefer Nova bakery to Cordi, but I'll give Cordi another shot since it's a bit closer. Will update my review next time I go.
Squid Ink is one of my favorite sushi places for a few reasons. happy hour til 7? YES...it's the only one I ever make it to on time, (even if it is 6:51 when I arrive haha) They have simple options, but also some unique and more complex dishes. 
Love the ambience-the bar is outdoor and indoor, so you can sit outside but still feel like you are inside.The artwork is very unique and clearly not purchased at iKea or Target... :)
Their remodel went downhill quick.  
It was adequate before their remodel but nothing like it was in early 2000s. Now It's thrashed and dirty.  I like being able to pre-purchase my seat and they recline which is nice.  But having to argue with a guy to get out of my seat is ridiculous. I will only go if the seats are super cheap other than that, it's not worth it. There are better alternatives.
This is an OK coffee shop if you happen to be at the Orleans.  It is the only place in e casino with free wifi.  I would give it another star if it was not in the Orleans.

My cafe mocha tasted like hot chocolate one day, hopefully an exception and not the norm.
Definitely amazing. A little on the greasy size, but you have to expect that with meals largely made of meat. The grilled vegetales and entragña were INCREDIBLE! Seriously, best skirt steak I've ever had. The owner is really cool and does the rounds of the (tiny) restaurant. They're expanding into the space next door eventually. Also, it's BYOB so don't forget to bring your booze.
J'ai été là pour prendre un verre après un superbe évènement Yelp. Étant parti en voyage....j'en avais entendu parler vaguement...mais sans plus...En étant dedans je me suis souvenue que c'était THE SPOT ben à la mode donc plusieurs parlent. 

Un mardi soir..c'était bondé ...tsé il y avait très peu ou pas de table vide qu'on pouvait voir à partir de la vitrine qui donne sur Ste-Catherine.  Mais bon vu que ça avait d'l'air cool..je suis rentré avec mon amie. Les 2 hôtesses me disent de laisser le manteau au vestiaire..qu'il n'y a pas de charge et tout. C'est ce que je fais. Je n'étais pas habillé pour sortir et 0 maquillage, bref je n'étais pas le client cible et sa paraissait.  Les 2 hôtesses me demandent si j'ai une réservation, je dis non, elles essaient de trouver une table...et je leur dit...Mais je veux juste prendre un verre. Alors une hôtesse nous dit..ah alors je vais vous amener au bar. 

Mais oui toi...je ne savais pas qu'il y avait un beergarden derrière avec des sofas, des plantes, des tables de pool, des petits plats et de l'alcool!   On demande un pichet de bière au bar. 18$ pour le pichet et plusieurs format...on a pris le plus gros. La serveuse super mais super sympathique.  Elle nous a demandé si c'était notre première fois ..nous a parlé du menu etc etc. La carte de mon amie avait un problème..j'ai donc dû aller chercher ma carte au vestiaire pour payer. La chère barmaid blonde aux cheveux long bouclé a été hyper compréhensible et zéro stress. 

Comme on avait déjà manger avant on avait pas faim, mais les plats sentaient hyper bon!! C'est sûre et certains que j'y retourne. J'aimerai ça y retourner plus tard en soirée..tse quand la musique forte commence et le monde est drunk et la piste de dance se forme..! Reste à voir si c'est vrai qu'ils sont si select le soir et autant rempli comme les autres avis le mentionne!
The absolute worst doctors office I have been to since I have been in Vegas. You wait for hours, even with an appointment. You have schedule office visits months in advance. The only reason I went there for so long is because Dr. Shin is an awesome doctor. HPN doesn't offer him as a PCP anymore, so there was no reason for me to continue to go there. The other doctors there do not want to do anything for you. They act like they are trying to save the insurance companies money. They make you wait forever, then rush you out. They are the perfect example of the worst health care system (Las Vegas) has to offer you. Avoid this place if at all possible. Dr. Shin still works in the urgent care here though, if you ever need it. He is great doctor and a good guy.
*Only counter seats - grab and go place
*The tacos are reasonably priced. They have taco tuesday where its $8 for 3 tacos

-Chips + Guac with Mexican Coke and Pineapple Jarritos
The chips were lightly salted which went well with the smooth and creamy guac. However I do prefer my guac to have a bit more lime and good chunks of avocado to give it more texture.

-Chorizo Taco
The chorizo was seasoned perfectly - slightly spicy but not in a burning hot sensation. A hint of saltiness from the tangy queso fresco went well with the chorizo and the pico de gallo added that dose of freshness to the taco. The flavor really can't be beat, and it's definitely a must try if you haven't already.

-Baja Fish Taco
fish was lightly breaded and still able to hold its shape. ! I appreciated how they kept the taco refreshing by not drenching the slaw in dressings and the fish was not oily at all. To blend everything together, just squeeze some lime juice and it was pretty much one of the best fish taco I have ever had in Toronto so far.

-Chicken Hermanos Taco
The shredded chicken with a super sweet and spicy sauce all nestled between corn tortillas with a sprinkle of sharp red onions. Topped it all off with some juicy and sweet pineapple to tone down the heat. Are you drooling?  I'm drooling.

-Tofu Taco
Since they used firm tofu, the small bits of crunchy tofu added a nice texture to each bite and I found the overall taco to be quite sweet? I was hoping for more spices or other toppings to balance the sweetness. Tien and I decided to add their house special sauce for more flavor and oh boy, it was HOT. Later we found out it was habanero hot sauce.. so add it in moderation :)!

-Barbacoa Taco
I found the beef to be quite tough and chewy, not "fork tender" like what I would expected from being braised for a long time. I also thought the beef was not as flavorful as others, but I really liked the fresh pico de gallo. 

-Pulled Pork Taco
On the other hand this taco was just..ohmygosh-so-good-bursting-with-all-the-flavors-pulled-pork. The meat was soft, succulent, juicy and had that "fall-off-the-bone" texture. Slathered in a delicious BBQ sauce and topped it off with some crunchy slaw - It. Was. Magnificent.

-Churros
Nothing beats a fresh, still-warm churro, with its crisp outer shell exploding with cinnamon sugar and soft, chewy inside that helps balance the cinnamon sugar sweetness with a light saltiness. I also loved how both the chocolate and caramel sauce had a mild sweetness to it - which was quite dangerous as I finished 2 churros in one seating .. oops.
Awesome!!

Retro Bakery just shot up my list of top cupcakes in Las Vegas. If you don't believe me, try some yourself!

Always on the hunt for anything bakery, I came across Retro Bakery on Yelp. I did see a few people had written some Stella reviews on this business, so after doing some recon from the NorthWest Yelp Crew Ty W and Mary S, I made my way to Retro with little care for my cavities.

Located on North Durango drive, in North West Las Vegas. Retro Bakery has established itself in a small strip mall. When locating it using your conventional smart phone it will be a little odd in how it displays the route, so keep your eyes peeled.

Once Inside I was greeted by very helpful young lady, being my first time she went through everything that was on display and pricing. Very helpful. I ended up with a half dozen.
2x Red velvet
1x Cotton candy
1x Drumstick
1x Cupcake of the month (pretty much chocolate overload)
1x cookie cupcake

After a sample of each and I was not disappointed!!! Each had that smooth fluffy texture with an explosion of flavor.

Although I didn't look into it much more, it  seemed like they had custom cakes for purchase as well. Something I might have to look into in the future.

If your living over this side of town and are needing birthday or just any old reason to get something sweet, Retro Bakery seems to be the place to come. 


Overall
Service: 4-5
Food: 5-5
Cleanliness: 5-5
Coming back: Yes
Tried it today for the first time and went around noon. Not too many people inside so I ate at the bar. The bar tender recommended wings and pizzetta. They were both delicious. I ordered my wings crispy and well done. The Italian style kind and they came out perfect.
My husband and I decided to see Dr. Shapiro, after over a year of trying to get pregnant. We went through all the testings that was recommended by Dr. Shapiro and found our problems. Our only option was IVF. 

Dr. Shapiro was very professional and he even answered my e-mails after hours (8pm). He had great bedside manners and he was very confident that we would get pregnant.  

Due to our busy schedule the fertility center was able to work around our schedule between the Sahara office and the Henderson office (we mainly went to the Sahara office). I really enjoyed the staff from the front staff to the back staff. Trish (IVF coordinator) was very helpful in answering all my questions and concerns via phone or e-mail. Gwen\/Jennifer (billing) were also very helpful in answering my questions regarding the financial. With all the blood work that I had to do, Dove is your girl. 

Overall, I would recommend The Fertility Center of Las Vegas. 
P.S. We are now 4 months pregnant with our first IVF cycle.
I like this place.   I have eaten here a few times for lunch.  Service was good and fast. Free pie Wednesday's is great... I always get the Apple pie. The fried chicken is very flavorful and the rolls are a crime they are so good.  The side salads are good as well.  I like the combination of the chicken with the mashed sweet potatoes.
OK, it's probably premature to give this truck five stars, but it's all I have to go on... The jalapeño popper sandwich? Probably the best sandwich I've ever had in my life. It was so so so good.

Honestly I should probably subtract a star just because I can't find a picture of their menu board that has the jalapeño popper sandwich actually on it.

That's all I've had. And that's all I have to go on. If you like jalapeño poppers, and you like spicy food,  and you like sandwiches then you should go to this truck and eat this sandwich. 

And if they don't offer it when they visit your venue? Then you should raise your voice and point and gesticulate and be outraged and question their intelligence for not making this a regular menu item.
It's nice to have a Tempe location of this gem! I'm still getting used to the whole raw seafood concept but it's growing on me. When I'm feeling adventurous I'll come here. 

Came for the store's opening event and enjoyed their 50% off special and free cotton candy :) The line was super long but they were fully staffed in anticipation of the crowds and kept it clean and orderly. 

I've been to the Scottsdale location and the ordering process is the same. I like the layout of this location a little more because to me, it feels more open. 

I tried their half salad half rice with ahi luah and salmon. Again, eating raw fish still makes me a little uneasy but it tasted fresh and I love the myriad of toppings and sauces.  

Parking can be somewhat tricky as there are a few other popular restaurants in this plaza. Which also means there are other dining options if you or anyone in your party aren't thrilled about seafood. If you're a little adventurous, give this place at least one shot.
I don't know exactly where to start I wanted to Eagle Rider Figure if I can't finance a bike I would join a club where I could ride when I wanted to though I didn't join the club I was more than surprised the staff was very friendly the places mcenelly clean on top of it I was at my wit's end being turned on many places a lady by the name of April convinced me to fill out a finance app very next day I called her not even telling my wife and boom not only did they tell me I was financed I was more than surprised a 2014 ultra Glide I absolutely love my bike now like with everything there's been a little things here and there that need to be taken care of let me tell you the finance manager now Pedro and they service manager Paulie I have gone above and beyond to take care of me and my bike though at first it seemed like I was going to be in there every day I wasn't these two gentlemen make sure that I have been completely taken care of and I constantly asking me how things are going with my bike I'm telling you joining a bike club is cool I would suppose but getting a bike from these people was one of the best experiences I've ever had if you're out there looking for a bike I think you should try to stop here first you might be very surprised come what may happen Lord knows I was by the grace of God and putting good people in my way my wife and I are happily enjoying this bike Pedro and Paulie thank you very much for everything you guys are the best
If I were a superhero... no wait, scratch that. As a superhero, one of my biggest weaknesses is a good pastry. Am I'm always in search of flaky, sweet, buttery pastries. This is one battle where my sensible side always loses to my primal cravings.

So being in the St. Lawrence market area I decided to try Stonemill, which so many of my fellow Yelp friends have said good things about. 

The raspberry twist was pretty good, crisp, flaky and sweet, just as I like 'em! And considering I got it late in the afternoon I'd love to try a fresh one in the early morn.

The chocolate almond danish was a bit of a disappointment. It was soft and buttery,  but too soft for my liking and didn't lend itself any texture. Maybe it's cause I picked one up late in the afternoon - but it is what it is.

They ran $1.59 each.

4 stars for the raspberry twist, 2 stars for the chocolate almond danish, so 3 stars overall. I'd come back to try some of their other breads and pastries next time I'm in the area. Meanwhile, I'm going to hit the gym...
After trying the Yountville location, stopping by was a no brainer.  Especially since I was at a conference inside the Venetian.  Didn't have time to consume the pastries on site but purchased them before hopping on my flight home.

Disappointed they didn't have the variety of breads similar to the Yountville location.  Macaroons were inconsistent, some dry and they didn't seem to have the same texture as the ones I had before.  However, I did finally get the TKO cookie and that was good.  I can only imagine how much better the one in Yountville must've tasted.  Maybe the pastries\/cookies are flown in from Yountville.  

I'll save my stomach for their Yountville location.
Well......it's late Sunday morning in Waxhaw, NC. Brunch at Rippingtons. Good new the pork chop in my Pork and Eggs cooked perfectly! Scrambled eggs were under scrambles......whites separate from the egg and runny. Both entrees were the same, egg wise. The second entree had over cooked sausage, crispy bacon as ordered and home fries deep fried to an inedible crisp! And no toast or biscuits. 

Avoid breakfast food!
My absolute favorite when ordering in!  Of course, being a simpleton, I only get the cheese pizza, but it's sooooooo good!  Just the right amount of cheese and sauce with a great fluffy, yet crispy crust.  And you must try the cheesy breadsticks, which I think only come family style....aka, huge!  It's the size of a small pizza covered in cheese, but yet not too greasy.  

Prices are cheap, we get an X-tra large pizza and family order of breadsticks, and it's delivered in a consistent 45 minutes for $25 bucks with tip.  When I'm in the mood for a pizza party on my couch - this is where I call.
They don't always get it right, but let's be real: you want pizza at 2:30am and they consistently provide that service. Don't get excited, just get drunk.
First time here and I was really impressed. Great food, Good price. Friendly staff... I'll definitely be back.
The gym is old, and it only gets all of the old machines that every other 24 Hour Fitness in LV gets rid of.  They never get new machines.  It really may be the worst 24 Hour in the city.
Had heard so many great things about Le Reve, that we decided this trip we would make it a point to see this show.  A word of caution about getting your tickets - buying over the web doesn't seem to give you much choice in your seating.  I found that calling the box office connected me to a person who gave me lots of helpful information, and allowed us to choose the exact 2 seats that we would be getting.

The show is a mix of dancing, synchronized swimming and aerial stunts.  There are no obstructed views and there really isn't a bad seat in the house, so it's just a question of doing you like being close to the performers, or being able to see the whole thing from farther away.  The stage is also extremely interesting - sometimes it's dry, sometimes the performers are ankle deep in water, and sometimes they are doing dives from 30 or 40 feet up.  There are also some really amazing tricks, and if you saw the guy who does the air walk with the street lamp, then you know exactly what I mean!

  It's a minor complaint, but If there's one thing that I found difficult, it was that at some parts of the show there were so many things going on that it was hard to know where to concentrate one's attention.  There was a pretty cool move where the girls did some kind of jump or basket throw, but I only saw the catch at the end, because I wasn't looking at the right location on stage.  

   There are some humorous skits sprinkled in, and overall I thought it was an amazing show.  The closer you sit to the stage, the more you will have to look up.  Knowing what I know now, I would pick the seats farthest away from the stage, because it allows you to watch all of the action.
Good burger but they don't do the best on getting orders correct.  There were 3 of us and only one person had their order correct.
Pizza is one of those things which seems oh so simple, but can be screwed up oh so easily.  Thankfully, Libretto gets it right. 

Thin crust? Check. Gooey cheese? Check. Fresh ingredients? Check. Crazy hot oven? Yessir.

Done in true Napoli fashion, Pizzeria Libretto brings Napoli style pizza to the Toronto in an authentic way, right down to the semi-wet crust in the middle due to the fresh mozza cheese releasing it's moisture, the crispy crust around the edges which show the marks of a truly hot oven.

If you're tired of my babble, let's just say it's GOOD. They have some good combinations (duck confit was great) and I guarantee you'll enjoy your meal. If you're not a fan of thin crust pizzas, this will make you a thin-liever.
I've been a fan, well client of TAMARA for over 3 years now!  That speaks volumes with me:). Tamara is an extremely talented lady at what she does.  She goes the extra mile to make you feel comfortable during the facial service.  She knows how to put you at ease and comfort you with silence too.  Tamara is clean, informative and the ambiance of the facial room is perfect!  As for her Brazlian Wax, that's another story- best ever and she uses organic wax. Never red or pink! I can't wait for my next service with her.  
Facials- she listens and will not go out of one's comfort zone.   She gets into those areas and viola! 'Things' are gone!
Make an appointment people!  
Best is texting Tamara 702-375-1256
We had never purchased anything from the Meat House before, but that didn't stop me from bidding on a charity's silent auction item that featured several selections from their store.

Several months after winning, I called the store owner and he was incredibly helpful, letting me know that I only needed to call them 20-30 minutes in advance to have my package ready for pickup.

When we picked up our order, I was truly impressed by so much about the store: The variety and quality of their meats, cheeses and wine, and the samples of their meat, olive oil and vinegar on display. The storefront seems more like a place you'd find in Napa, California or Tuscany, rather than in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The employees were friendly the moment I approached the place, with one wishing me a great day even as she was leaving at the end of her shift, and holding the door for me.

I scoured the store looking for something truly unique to buy along with my auction items, and settled on crab cakes, one of my favorites since I'm from the Maryland area. A man behind the counter took pains to get me the best recipe to fix them, and even recommended a restaurant in town that he thought served the "best" once he knew I was a crab cake aficionado.

I returned home with a slew of meat and a delighted husband, who graciously packed up everything in freezer\/FoodSaver bags in portions we would eat. Everything we unwrapped was exceptionally fresh and a far step above what you might find in a grocery store's butcher selection.

To date, we've feasted on hamburgers, chicken breasts, "meat house" marinated turkey tips and maple bourbon marinated steak tips. Last night we had the steak tips, which is what prompted me to write this review. Everything is delicious, but I could not get ENOUGH of the maple bourbon steak tips. As someone who "hates" bourbon (thanks to a college experience with some) I was wary of these tips, and ordered them only because my husband wanted them.

They were the most delicately flavored, savory and tender bites of meat I've had in a long, long time. 

My husband is bragging to his friends about this "great deal" that I scored, and we look forward to trying the many other items we ordered from the Meat House. We are new customers, and we will most DEFINITELY be back. The quality of the food we've had from them is simply unparalleled. You owe it to yourself to try this place out.
course was in fantastic condition, staff was very helpful and professional, Shirley in the bar was beyond great and Dan in the golf shop was very helpful and professional. would recommend this golf course to everybody!!! beyond impressed!!! thank you for the great experience!!!!!
This is an excellent practice facility. A little out of the way if you live in Summerlin though. They have sand traps, putting greens, and two levels to tee off from at their driving range. They also have a driving range where you can hit off the grass. They have lights on their par 3 course, so you can play at night. I prefer Angel Park if I play at night though. Nice pro shop.
Really special Southwest Cuisine. The chicken tacos made a great starter. I also suggest the queso.. it's quite spicy but very good.

On two occasions, I have ordered the New Mexican Pork Tenderloin.  Wow! Really tasty.  The corn muffins were also great. 

All of the food I have tried here is top notch. The service was really good on my last visit, but once I had a server that was a bit condescending.  No big deal, but the guy had an attitude.

Overall if you like SW cuisine, try this!
Update: IT'S BACK!! They brought back the southwestern fried chicken dish - our absolute favorite. 5 stars and back in the restaurant rotation! Thanks SanTan!! 

San Tan used to be our favorite place to go - we LOVED the southwestern fried chicken meal, and it was the only reason we came here, but they've done a menu change, and our favorite is now gone :( 

The rest of the food is ok, and beer is good. Sad that we won't be coming back... Until they bring back the SW fried chicken!!

We ate:
Pub pretzel - good
Shrimp & grits - very blah, didn't finish it. Heartburn in immediate effect though!!
Buffalo chicken sandwich - too light on the buffalo sauce - sandwich had very little flavor. Ask for extra buffalo sauce!

Service was good though, do appreciate that :)
This is more of a fast food restaurant for me.  I think it's decent for something quick that will stay with you for awhile.
2.5\/5. 

I went here for the Summerlicious lunch. Upon entering the restaurant, I was impressed at how spacious it was! 

Normally for Summerlicious, I tend to pick the most expensive main course so it will worth the money lol. With that said, this time I chose the ravioli as my main since the steak will probably give me itis after lunch :(.

Overall thought: lunch was okay, but not spectacular. None of the items on their lunch menu jumped out to me as special. Since we had 12 people, there was also a service charge so our bill came to almost $40... which were probably the most expensive lunch I ever had.

-East Coast Seafood Escabeche: 
The seafood was cooked perfectly, and by marinating them in vinegar and olive oil, it gave the seafood a deliciously sharp tang. The watermelon and capers toned down the tanginess of the seafood with theirs sweetness and saltiness flavors, respectively. However, I felt the chili was not needed as the dish turned out to be too spicy. Don't get me wrong, I love spicy food but the heat from the chili lingered in my mouth, and prevented me from tasting other flavors.

-Lemon Basil Ravioli: 
The ravioli had a perfect ratio of fillings to dough, and I believe the filling was ricotta cheese, yum! Unfortunately there were only 2 dots of the lemon basil sauce on the plate, hence I couldn't taste the sauce at all :(. The tomato ragout was just like any other regular tomato pasta sauce that I could have made. Also, I'm not sure why there were a few pieces of candied walnuts as they didn't go well with the savory ravioli at all... 

-Corn meal crusted Halibut: 
Friend loved it but the halibut was overcooked. Moreover, for me anything crusted with cornmeal is pretty much tasteless, so I was expecting the sauce to deliver a big punch of flavor, but I was quite disappointed...

-Strawberry Bavarois: 
I didn't get to try, but my friend seemed to enjoy it. I was quite curious of how the black pepper would go with the bavarois though

-Triple Layered Chocolate Mousse: 
I ordered the mousse and it was not overly sweetened, however it wasn't bad nor awful. The mousse itself had a dense texture and strong chocolate flavor. The first layer was jello or something, I just can't quite put my finger on it but it was good! The top layer was tangy and really helped to cut down the rich chocolate mousse.
Great decor and attentive staff.  Owner\/host Nicco, was very pleased to talk food and business  (only been open 6 wks.) It was refreshing.
We had a small issue with waiting for one of our plates to come out, hence the 4 stars.  But the owner asked if he could provide dessert for the trouble.  We were in a bit of a rush so he instead removed the item from our bill, classy guy! Kept it from being 3 stars... food took a while to come out.
I was convinced to try the Osso Buco, an off the menu item, holy crap was that good! Also $45, which wasn't mentioned before hand... oh well, was falling off the bone tender, very delicious, and huge, I will throw a picture up.
Nice place not busy yet, so comfortable atmosphere, I would come back for sure.
I lived here about 9 years ago so my review may be dated, but unless they reinforced all the interior walls with solid concrete and kicked out 3\/4 of the residents I would assume the place is still a noisy dump.  I could hear every conversation my neighbors had through my bedroom wall and most of them were about drugs.  The pool was closed by the health department the entire time that I lived there.  While it was within walking distance of Mill Ave. that was just about the only good thing about this place.  

When I lived here the apartments were utilities paid but in the summer the place never got cooler than about 85 degrees.  I had the room at the end of the hall in a three bedroom unit and it was just HOT.

The laundry rooms were a mess, the pool was a swamp, cars were broken into constantly and like I said, the residents were a very colorful group to say the least.  If someone else has lived there more recently I would love to know if there have been any improvements made!
Suuuuuuuuuper friendly.  Really good, and I think, unique, options.  Limited menu is probably the only REAL downside.  BYOB, so plan ahead.  

Nice location next to a juice bar on a sleepy street just off Freeport Road.  African Peanut Stew was delicious, entree was better (but the entrees change on the weekends).  

A liiiiiiittle hippy dippy for my tastes, but if you have an open mind and a sense of humor\/adventure...it's adorable.  

Fifth star for a full menu and a bar...I'll keep my eyes open.
Came in yesterday for a late lunch with my girlfriend, this time we dined on the patio with our fur babies!! Service was awesome, Danny took really great care of us!!! And food was great like last time. Cannot wait to come back when the weather is a little cooler for the dogs.
The strippers were friendly, but the 40$ service with 2 drinks, limo ride to and from your pick up spot was not what what's expected. 
We had a 11 girls (none overweight) and the tires seem to drag and the driver didn't care. 
The female strippers were very nice. Seemed a little uncomfortable with the male customers but did their job. The male dancers seemed nice as well. one of them touched my butt so I was a little thrown off, they didn't seem rude so I didn't take it that way, they are just trying to work.
I called Giant of Scottsdale and ask if they currently had women's small, full suspension mountain bikes in stock. The response I received was "yes we have several". I asked them how many they had and do they have different types? They said " Yes we have several to choose from in small." I drove to the Scottsdale location (taking me over 40minutes to get there) and found that they only had one extra small they tried to say I would fit on. I rode it and it was too small. They said they just sold the small they had in the shop therefore I could not try it out. I was very disappointed that they told me they had several smalls in different levels to choose from, when in fact they had none when I arrived. I will not return to this bike shop.
This store is awesome! The staff here are incredibly friendly and helpful!

They make it a fun place to be!
After living in Philly for 2 years and being deprived of my life long sheetz addiction, it would take a massacre for me to rate ANY Sheetz less than 5 stars, so, yes, I'm probably biased. However, I accept that fact and will continue to love sheetz until I have no love left to give, and this location is no acception. Thanks for supporting my addiction, Sheetz! :)
My finace and I are devastated that we recently moved out of the delivery area for Spadina Garden. Best Chinese delivery in the city bar none.

Get the crispy ginger beef and the spicy peanut chicken plus a white rice. I could eat it at least weekly. Maybe their dishes are too saucy but it's Canadian Chinese food, that's how they do. Scrape some off or let the steamed rice soak it up.

We often got the Singapore noodles as well which were standard but tasty, had a nice curry flavour going on.

It's not cheap but we would always get at least 2 meals out of it so it's justifiable.

If you're in the delivery area - please take advantage for my sake.
Bel ambiance  de bar à vin.  J'avais fait une commande d'un   succulent  vin rouge corsé  léger . J'ai essayé  leur plat à base de betteraves qui était  bon et enfin  j'ai terminé avec un Cointreau et une crème brûlé  qui était très  délicieux !
Came here for brunch\/lunch this Sunday; I wasn't overly hungry, but luckily everything was made a la carte, and priced fairly! I shared the chorizo meat balls with my friend (it came with 6 and a pile of shredded beets), the sauce was sweet and savory with leafy bites of cilantro. I often find anything with chorizo to be too salty, but it was just right, especially with the sweet sauce pairing. They have the healthy option to get lettuce wraps instead of corn or flour tortillas, and seeing as there was an abundant amount of free chips and salsa, I didn't miss having a tortilla-the lettuce was perfect! The free salsa and chips also came with three smaller and unique tasting salsas\/sauces that varied in flavor and spiciness-it was awesome to have variety. To top of the great food and service, the atmosphere was amazing. I loved the high ceilings and stained glass, a huge rustic chandelier and beautiful well kept bathrooms. I will definitely be back!
Black Tonkotsu: It's definitely heavy but somehow I finished mine with no problem. My hubby ordered Red, which was definitely lighter, but with a kicked up attitude. We loved them both, and we are willing to come back to try other ramen as well. At Jinya, sides are plentiful as well. We ordered brussels sprouts tempura (very creative and intricate), octopus balls (I'll come back just for them), and refreshing annin-dofu at the end of our meal. The only thing they're missing is fried rice, which isn't a big deal at all. The service was super fast, hostess\/servers were all friendly, and it's not as crowded as monta\/spring mountain. It seats about 50 people (spacious), so you can actually enjoy your meal without feeling rushed. HUGE PLUS.
A more than acceptable place to stay in Madison, and there several points that I liked.
1)  The room is nice.  It feels more like an apartment than a hotel, because FOR A CHANGE, the bathroom is located near your bedroom.  When you wake up, you pass your sink, jump in the shower, and a quick 180 degree turn from your sink is the closet.  It's a refreshing design that makes you feel at home, instead of having to go all the way to your front door.
2)   There is a pretty spacious kitchen in each room, with a microwave, fridge and sink.  I'm not really sure people want to cook a meal in their hotel rooms, but I were the kind of person that wanted to reheat restaurant leftovers, or microwave popcorn, this setup is ideal.
3)  A breakfast buffet is included, and they rotated the food every day!  It was shocking, in a good way.  One day was breakfast burritos, the other day was eggs benedict, and yet another day was a egg McMuffin kind of breakfast sandwich.  I never saw the same food twice, and I liked how juice, coffee and water were all self-service.  If I want another orange or cranberry juice, I don't necessarily have all day to wait to find one.  I'd rather just get it myself.

This Residence Inn is convenient to shopping and a few restaurants, and I would gladly stay here again!
The ONLY place in Madison where you can get a good fresh donut. Try the Old Fashioned's , as they are the best in my opinion. Remember to get there early on the weekends for optimal selection,but they also make the donuts at night as well, so sometimes 6:30-7:00pm on weekdays works well. Nothing beats a hot donut from the Greenbush.
Solid Home Renovations completed the remodel of our master bath and family bath in 4 weeks last fall.  We made changes during the process.  They were easy to work with and still completed the project on schedule.  We were 100% satisfied with the results and knew we would use Solid Home Renovations again.  

Last month, we completed the remodel of the rest of our home, including a new kitchen, new flooring and paint throughout. The project was completed within 6 weeks and we are completely satisfied with the results.  I would highly recommend Solid Home Renovations.  

M & J
Went here for lunch today. I had never visited the old location, but I'm glad to see the restaurant is back and in a great new location. There was soccer on the big screen, and cold beer on tap. Really enjoyed my fish and chips, but for an "authentic" British Pub, I was disappointed that I couldn't substitute mushy peas (a $3 side item) for cole slaw (also a $3 side item) for my entree. I've had mushy peas with my fish and chips all over London. I've never been served cole slaw with them in the UK before. They seriously ought to consider giving you an option. They take so many steps to seem authentic, but they totally blow it by not allowing authentic sides with the fish and chips.

Still, service was good. We'll be back. Hopefully they'll get it together on offering fish and chips with mushy peas, the way you'd really get it in London.
Spent the Holidays in the 716 (Buffalo, NY) last month and for some strange reason had a taste for wings. Mind you, we likely enjoyed this Western New York delicacy at least 5 times during late December but still a lite spicy snack was in order. 

We ordered a couple of drinks and a double order of wings medium with a side of hot sauce. The server was prompt, pleasant and recognized us from earlier visits. It's nice to enter an eatery and be made to feel like old friends.
Being a slow Monday evening, our wings were served in short order exactly as ordered.  

Our wings were as meaty, spicy and flavorful as any wing I've ever consumed in WNY. And the friendly atmosphere makes Lebowski's a great
place to meet friends, enjoy an adult beverage or two and sample some great wings. You'll find a rather diverse menu to choose from but don't miss the opportunity to try some of the best wings in town!
One of my favorite restaurants in Madison.  The food us always delicious and inventive.  The service is friendly and knowledgable.  The daily specials are great, especially if you're like me and like variety in your meals.  Highly recommended.
Tried out their walnut red bean cakes, I like it. I will say 4 stars. Others products are 3 stars. Still recommend to try if you never have a walnut cake like me.
This is my other favorite hotel in Vegas.  The check-in area isn't quite as nice, especially when you consider that invited guest check-in is just a small podium (compared to Mandalay Bay's separate lounge).  However, the rooms are quite a bit nicer and very comfortable.  Finally, you don't have to watch TV sitting in bed!  Venetian gives you a separate sitting area and a separate TV from the bedroom area.  Mrs. C really likes the small stool and make-up table in the bathroom as well.  

I think the food choices are also pretty good at Venetian.  There are 2 different food courts if you want something quick, or just want to run downstairs and bring food back to your room.  There's also Grand Lux Cafe.  I have been to Bouchon twice, and it was ok - maybe French Laundry s just an entirely different experience because you're in Napa Valley.

Two more great things about staying at the Venetian: you are centrally located on the Strip and very walkable to Forum shops, Fashion Show mall and many other hotels.  If you had a race between walking and driving from the Venetian, I'd bet that the person walking would win.  Also, guests at the Venetian get 50% off a day pass at Canyon Ranch Spa, and Mrs. C went crazy when she got to experience that place.  I get to gamble, and she gets to hang out at a super fancy spa.  Everyone wins!
Where other stores in the same category has closed, REi has remained open and I hope they stay open and survive every cycle cause I just love this place. I love coming here to browse their products. I love buying their products and I love how once I'm a member, their generous return policy. 
Funny enough. It's their generous return policy that has turned me into a loyal customer and someone who doesn't mind paying a higher price for a similar item I can buy elsewhere.
RockSalt has so much potential but is really just ok. I've been twice and walked away both times feeling like it could have been better. They always seem to be having some $1 oyster special so be on the look out for those days\/times. I'd like to see the service step it up a bit.
This place is straight up creepy and run down. Last time I went all the G&D insignia was gone and the menu seriously said, "Restaurant name to be determined" or something equally as ludicrous. Avoid at all costs. The menu is sub-par, the service is crappy, and the decor is about two decades out of date.
Yet another superb lunch spot in this area of the city. I am lucky to work at Adelaide and Spadina, we are spoiled for options!

Colleagues took me here for my birthday lunch last week, it was my second time at Jules and both have been very enjoyable. 

The staff are very friendly and without a reservation, seated us right away. If you're a bigger group, aim to go around 11:30 because it did pick up. I had the spinach and goat cheese quiche with salad, it is such a satisfying lunch. The pastry on the quiche is dynamite and there was an abundance of spinach and cheese in the filling. 

Worth mentioning they will allow 1\/2 salad and 1\/2 fries on the side at Jules! One of my colleagues had the burger medium-rare and it looked delicious, they clearly use a high quality beef. We all enjoyed our meals thoroughly.

My husband raves about the steak frites here, it is a bit much for me to order at lunch but it seems very popular so it must be good! 

Nice bistro lunch, slightly fancy compared to the other spots around here.
Awesome! Been to Soul several times. Grill Greek cheese, bone marrow and lamb chops are a favorite.
The food is good.  It is best for a casual dinner or appetizers.  It is a good place to enjoy drinks and people watch the casino.
The environment is cool and classy.  You can get away with casual attire, but a little dressier would fit better.  This is definitely an option for a romantic dinner as well.

The service team was attentive and friendly.  The bread basket is filled with tasty options.

For my meal I ordered the Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti.  It was very good.  It also has brown butter, horseradish and bread crumbs as part of the meal.  The horseradish is very subtle, so do not get scared away by that.  The bone marrow helps give it deep flavor.  The meal is very good.  The portion is modest, so definitely consider an appetizer, soup or salad to pair with it.
So convenient to pop in here, and literally buy an outfit right off the manikin for a last minute date night, or pick up a unique gift for a girlfriends birthday party. The clothes selection is constantly changing, and there are lots of sales. Everything is separated by colors which makes it easy to narrow things down and get the most use of your time. The quality is also impressive, and seems to hold up to washing and normal wear and tear much better than most trendy boutique clothes I have found elsewhere.
They had crab legs, sushi, longan, escargot and frog legs!!!  It don't get any more hardcore than that!
I have taken both of my daughters cars to Dennis. I take the cars to him and he tells me what needs to be done. He is a trustworthy mechanic and I don't need to worry about him trying to scam me. So far I have not had an issue with any of his work.

I highly recommend this shop if you need repairs done on your vehicle and you don't want to get scammed. Best place in Vegas!
I can't believe I haven't reviewed New York-New York yet!  My then boyfriend brought me here for my first time in Vegas and we've stayed here several times since.  It's definitely one of my favorite resorts on the strip!

There's now the daily resort fee, which at least includes two free drinks.  The rooms are small, but the beds are comfy and we loved the extra pillows.  There's plenty going on within the hotel, with lots of dining choices and bars.  Zumanity is here too, which is a great show.  My husband is also part of the Player's Club, and although he by no means spends a large amount of money gambling we got a great room rate offer.


Definitely one of my favorites in Vegas!
Coming to the outlet, Cole Haan was the main reason for the visit. I always like going to there store. I have a lot of there shoes, and I don't mind adding to my collection. 

On your regular, casual day, you will probably find me in a pair of Cole Haan shoes or loafers. They're soooo comfortable and great quality. 

Great deals! I bought a few things from there. Got a couple pair of shoes for an awesome price that can't be beat. I like there wallets a lot too. They had new ones in, and I purchased one. I like there wallets a lot because they leather doesn't stretch with use like taking your card out on a regular basis. They're very stylish as well. 

The staff here was really nice. Very cleaned and organized. They have a clearance rack there with really good deals too. Check it out!
As a big fan of Julio G's, I was hoping this place would be just as amazing. Unfortunately, I was completely disappointed. 

My friends and I decided to check this place out for dinner. On a Saturday night, this place was completely dead. That should have been my first clue to get out of there. We went in and the decor was the exact same as Julio's, which I thought was odd. Somehow, service took forever, even though it was really slow. I literally had to walk up to the bar to get a refill on my drink because nobody bothered to come by and check on us while we waited over 30 minutes for our food.

I ordered the chicken tacos, which were completely disgusting. I sent them back (I never send food back) but I literally could not  stomach the food. I re-ordered chicken tacos with basic chicken, lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream. They were better than what I had orginally ordered but tasted similar to what I could make at home. One of my friends ordered the enchiladas with enchilada sauce and I literally wanted to throw up after tasting them. Our waiter and the manager were both extremely apologetic but I knew I would never be eating here again.

If you're looking for a good meal or authenic mexican, this place is definitely not it.
From the outside this small spot is behind an Italian restaurant.  Once inside, fun vintage car themed with a fun funky patio.

As far as the food, yummy bar food- green chili fries are a must!  We love the potato skins too.

Decent habanero lime margarita with tang- not spicy at all. 

Friendly attentive service both times.
Lunch during the week is great here. It is a laid back atmosphere, a mix of ole school music and really nice staff. The food is really good, although I am stuck on the country fried steak, I have tried other items. they serve good sized portions and it is reasonably priced. Great choices of food. this is close to work, service is fast (not fast food fast) but I can take my time eating and still get back to work on time. very satisfying experience. Just too bad there isn't a cot at work for the "I have eaten well and am sleepy" afternoon nap. I will continue to eat here until everyone else discovers this place and it gets too crowded.
These guys did a radiator flush for me a few days ago - The manger was the one that helped me - he was fantastic!
We tried to purchase the exact Kia Optima EX Hybrid we wanted. It didn't work out however KYLE, general manager, made it right with us.
I belong to this gym...  I live in the South section of Pittsburgh, and I find that this gym is not too far from me.  The staff is friendly, the equipment is quite good.  You get two free personal training sessions when you join.  They have lots of weights (which my boyfriend uses) and a decent cardio room.  The only thing I would say is to increase some of the cardio equipment.  Water is only $1 a bottle!
Golf courses, have you ever seen one that wasn't easy in the eyes?! Nope, I don't think any golf course could be considered unattractive.  
Eagle Crest is tucked away in an older community and is well manicured.  
A friend invited me along for a fundraiser for autism.  This was a night glow golf course!  Think large sized 'glow sticks' for the holes, luminares for the pathway for the golf carts.  
Didn't see any do a rollover in a gold cart- luckily;)  Yes, indeed the golf balls provided a glowing color.  Definitely a fun evening on the course, more of play versus any competitive playing.  Inside had a small bar and eatery.  Pleasant staff, pro shop on premises.
Yes. 5 stars for SkinnyFats, even though I did not care for the CauliFire. We ordered the veggie burger, bean burger, steak sandwich, Asian chicken salad (Slow Boat), and steak salad. Forgive me for not remembering their names from the menu, but you can figure it out. Everything we ordered was from the skinny side of the menu. Everything was fantastic except for the spicy cauliflower. I did not care for it. All of the above plus three drinks came out to $68.00 total. Well worth it. The quality of the food was excellent!!

I highly recommend this place. I will be back to try the fat side of the menu. The chicken and waffles look pretty good.
Cute cute place with good food! Surprising since it's on the first floor of an office building but I'm not judging by the cover;)

We had the cheese fondue as an appetizer which was so so good!!! 
The Mahi entree I had was a little more rare then I'd like but it was a good new experience. I loved the asian cabbage slaw and the sticky rice was divine. There was sauce on the mahi and on the plate but it was not overwhelming at all. They know what they are doing there! I would TOTALLY go back again!!!
We were there at the casino theater to take in a movie, so we ended up eating here.  There are many bad reviews of this place, but I had a good experience.  The food was good, and our waitress was very attentive.  Don't know if I'll return, since it's on the opposite end of town as I am, but had a positive experience and would come back again if I were in the area.
Last weekend we stopped in to the Pink Taco for dinner pre show at The Joint in the Hard Rock Hotel. It location is within a two minute walk of the venue we were going to for the show.  Very convenient. The food was really yummy. I had the pink tacos and my vegan companion had the veggie tacos. We'll be back again next time we're in town.
I've tried many buffets in this city but this one is my favorite. I think we waited in line for about 30+minutes, but it was all worth it. I'd definitely come back.
Went here last night for dinner around 7:30 and it was packed!! We almost turned around and went someone else because there were no tables! While we opened the door to leave we noticed there was one table outside! I told him to sit down while I order! The weather was nice around the time we were eating, but towards the end of the dinner we did get a bit chilly. 
Anyways, it was taco tuesday! $1 tacos all day (they also have $1 tacos Monday - Friday from 3pm-5pm). I ordered two ground beef tacos and one chicken taco while my fiancé ordered one beef and one chicken. They have a salsa bar ranging from mild to hot. You can take a little or a lot of whatever salad you love the best! Anyways, once we were done eating we decided to get more because they were so good! This time we ordered all ground beef. The shredded chicken seemed to be a bit dry for me. Anyways, I ended up eating 6 tacos myself! And although there are no "servers" because you order at a counter, a young lady checked on us several times to make sure we were doing alright and to clear our trays when we were done. 
I will definitely be going back! They are suppose to be opening one near my work, and I cannot wait. Tacos every week then!
This Residence Inn is a little hard to find, even though it is right off I-17 and Northern. It is on a one-way frontage road, so you have to come from the north of Northern Avenue and slide down the frontage road to get to it. It is on hotel row for this area, just a mile form the Metro Center, and a bunch other hotels on eaither side of the freeway. 

It is a typical Residence Inn. It is a group of about 20 low rise 2 story buildings. Parking is adequate and nearby your door. 

Inside, this member of the Marriott chain is known as an extended stay type hotel, with a 2 room suite, which includes about 600 sq ft of space. There is a full kitchen, with 4 burner stove, full fridge, microwave and dishwasher, all in new stainless steel, with marble counter tops and a wood\/linoleum floor. Full dishes, glasses and utenzils are available like home. 

This one is pretty new, with clean, unstained furniture in fresh condition. There are also not 1, but 2 black 42 inch LG flat screen TVs., one in the bedroom and one in the living room. The living room has a desk, 2 seat dining table, a lounge chair and a small sofa with sofa bed. There is a door between the rooms, so if you wanted to have the kids along, you can still keep your sanity in the other room.

Depending on time of year, this R.I. is a good value, costing about $100\/night, which includes a free breakfast, evening hospitality hour, free Wi-FI internet, and free parking. 

This little one bedroom, if it was a condo near downtown San Francisco, would be a million dollars!

If you really want to save money, you can go next door to Motel 6, and pay $40\/night for a single person! Just ignore the riff raff!
Service is just okay--they are rude short with you. No parking. On a brick road that will have your car shaking the whole time. You will get your car swiped if you aren't careful. The cheese blend is good. The sauce is sweet: not slightly sweet, but sweet. There is a lot of appeal to Fioris because of the sauce. I guess I prefer something savory in my sauce and find the aggravation to make it less worthwhile than Mineo's in Mt. Lebanon
We got recommendations for this place from my parents and so, for our anniversary, we booked here. We were told though that it was first come, first served, in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the Bellagio and The Strip.
We went for lunch though, so it wasn't too busy. We were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls, with cheese and herbs infused. They were delicious!

We ordered the onion soup to start and I ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger. Our food came and was delicious. The soup was probably my favorite part. We were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert, but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse, on a decorated plate that said Happy Anniversary, which was a total surprise (they had asked when I booked if it was a special occasion, but had said nothing while we were there).
Overall the service was great, the food delicious and the view wonderful. It was a great experience!
The Flamingo is one of the old school Casino\/Hotels in Las Vegas. Most of it's contemporaries have been torn down or are on their way down. Desert Inn, Stardust, etc. 

Hilton bought it quite a while ago to add it to their huge flagship Hilton on the north end of the strip near the convention center (well at the time it was huge, now it is being dwarfed by new projects). 

It has been remodeled and spruced up by Hilton, and now it really serves as a mid-level Casino\/Hotel offering for Hilton in Vegas. Hilton has several large Condo\/Timeshare properties now for non-casino vacationers, and the Hilton still serves as the flagship. But, a few years ago, Hilton sold this property to Harrah's Group. 

As such, the hotel is nothing special for Vegas goers, and in this town where the hottest thing is whatever is the latest and largest, the Flamingo dwarfs in comparison. 

Perhaps the best part of the hotel is the large tropical courtyard with its lush greenery. They do offer a lot of cheap room specials, so it isn't a bad choice for value travelers who still want some Vegas luxury, and don't want the riff raff in the next room that comes at the Circus Circus, Hooters, Stratosphere or Excalibur.
I had high hopes for this place, I've been passed it over the years and I was sure it might be a nice place to go to.

So we roll in without a reservation, lucky we didn't reserve it was far from busy on a Friday night.

We we're waiting not that long to be seated. My first impression of this business was not of a normal sushi place, actually I kinda thought the decor was a little cheap. Not the standard a marriott would present.

We grab a few rolls, nothing really special on the menu that stood out that I could really say would have me back again.

Had some green tea ice cream which wasn't to bad, had a little sugar on the side which was a nice touch.

All in all it was just average. Not a place id go back to because I can get the Same experience or better somewhere else
If you're in the mood for a cheap, quick lunch, Hue Thai can certainly fit the bill.  I stick mostly to the sandwiches, of which the standouts are the Chinese Meatball and the Sunshine Egg.  I get the Pho on occasion, but there's better Pho right down the street if you're really in the mood for it.

The drinks are outrageously priced compared to the sandwiches.  The Snow bubbles are good, but boy do they cost.  When your egg rolls cost you more than your sandwich... hmm, yeah.

Also, if you are heading towards the mall it is in via spring mountain, use the western entrance above the mall, and you can park on the 2nd level for quick access to the restaurant without having to hike up and down the steep stairs!
This is one if my favorite trails in the Redrock canyon area.

Be sure to visit the waterfall when you're out there. The water flows to some degree most if the year although in the summer months it slows to a trickle.
The customer service skills of the cashier and manager were excellent, and the lobby seemed clean at 5-something in the morning.  However, my egg white biscuit with cheese was a little too goopy, and my hot chocolate tasted like a heated, faintly mocha sauced, Hershey's syrup chocolate milk.  It lacked any richness, and I was disappointed they don't have peppermint syrup (the cashier said white chocolate replaced it) that could have helped perk it up.  I might have to order 2% milk instead of skim next time.

On the plus side: It is NOT in one of those disgustingly tiny and hard to get in the drive through parking lots that many coffee places are in around here (Starbucks at 16th St and Bethany Home is a prime example of that).
I looove this library!  I could work here for hours!  My favorite things here include the cafe\/gift shop, the mag selection, the private study rooms, and the fact that there is a separate childrens area upstairs.  

Love it!
Went at Monday afternoon. Got that modern vibe. Had the Chilled Spicy Noodle. It was pretty good.
I tried Body Solutions as a Groupon offer. My sister and I bought 6 treatments for 2 small areas for $99. That's a steal if you ask me!

I decided to treat my forearms and chin. I had never been to a laser place before and had never recieved laser hair removal. I was hesitant but willing to try something to remove virtually pain free and more permanent to remove this unwanted hair!!

For the first few treatments, I didn't see a lot of results but was reassured by staff that it could take up to 6 treatments. Around my 5th treatment, I noticed a huge difference on my arm hair growth and was very excited! After my last treatment, I didn't see a lot of difference with my chin but did with my arms. I rarely shave those areas anymore and am very pleased with the results. 

Overall, the staff was friendly and very willing to answer any questions. I was able to schedule appointments on weekends, which was a huge convenience for me since I live far and work during the week. The place was clean and very professional. I would recommend this place for sure!
I came across Cathie's profile here on Yelp. I was in desperate need of a tailor for a dress that I bought online at David's Bridal. Even though the dress fits me okay, the length was my issue. I needed the dress for a wedding in Hawaii which was then just a week away. I told her my concerns and she was more than reassuring that she'll be able to do it and do it for less than David's Bridal would. 

I just got the dress yesterday and it fits perfect. She did such an awesome job at it! I would definitely use Cathie for all my dress emergencies. Highly recommended! 

**I will post of picture of the dress after the wedding.**
Summary: Overpriced pho with decent noodles and ok broth. But the Seafood Pho was terrible. Definitely do not get that. I'd stick with the Beef broth based Pho, or a curry base.

The review:
Any Pho place with nice decor is automatically suspect in my books. The better pho I've had has usually been at dives and places where you make sure you wipe down your utensils before using them. So walking into WonderPho alarms immediately went off.

I came here without reading any Yelp reviews, and after reading them now, my experience was similar. 

More expensive than other places, and cruddy service (we were the ONLY table there, yet the waiter didn't come by once during our meal to check up on us. I had to call him over i.e. yell, to get more water).  

I ordered the Seafood Pho. DO NOT GET IT.  It's one of the more expensive items on the menu, but you get two mussels, two pieces of fake crab, two tiny shrimps, and two tiny pieces of overcooked squid.  Definitely get one the beef base Pho or Curry dishes.

The positives are that the noodles themselves were actually decent, and from what I could tell of my friend's beef broth and curry broths, those were ok as well. The base isn't quite as oily as other Pho places, which is good or bad, depending how you look at it. 

Based on the seafood Pho alone, there's much better Pho to be had. And with plenty of options in that area (Dragon Pearl, a thai and japanese buffet next door, kelseys, coras, pizza, wings, freshi, etc.) unless you're craving Pho, I'd go somewhere else.

If I do end up coming again, I'll be sure to try a Rare Beef Pho (i.e. a 101 at most places) to compare the staple and report back.
This is my first review on Yelp. I've been a major consumer of the reviews and restaurant suggestions from Yelp so figured it was time to start contributing.

I just walked into this place off the street - I was hungry! I ordered the steak burrito bowl (don't remember the name on the menu) to stay.

I was disappointed! They were stingy with the meat, a few tiny pieces of dry steak. I'm assuming this is because I walked in post lunch rush hour, but still not an excuse. The plate was "buffed" up with abnormal amounts of whipped bean paste of som sorts, rice and lettuce.

I wouldn't come here. again, can't speak for the lunch service, most restaurants fast food places not named McDonalds tend to ration the food so as to not have waste.
Probably about the worst Bloody Mary I have ever had in my life! The "large" is a regular sized drink, it's sour and just not good at all. Skip this!
I tried Olympos Gyros out for lunch today.  It's lent, and in Pittsburgh that means long lines for fish sandwiches, so I figured it'd be quick, and since I'm almost certainly going to burn in hell anyway...why not eat meat?  It was quick, so at the very least I'm half right.

I ordered the "Zeus" off the "specialty" menu and got my gyro in about 5 minutes.  

It was slightly too big to carry in the little brown paper bag they give you so I had to cradle it like a newborn on the way to the car.  After I unwrapped it back in my office I thought maybe they'd forgotten the pita...because I couldn't see it.  

The Zeus is Chris Farley's proverbial "Fat Guy in a Little Coat"...it was messy and there was so much stuff inside the pita that the pita itself couldn't be found.  Once I did find it, I spent probably three minutes trying to figure out the best way to hold it without it turning into a complete nightmare.  (There is no best way).  

Tasted great.  I loved it.

But okay, seriously...Greeks, it's okay to make a pita slightly larger so that you can accommodate more stuff.  Pitas do NOT have to be one size fits all.  Or wait...do they?  Is that one of those weird ethnic rules that a REAL pita will only measure 1\/2 cubit in diameter or something?  I don't think that's a thing.  Is that a thing?

Anyway...super good, fast, cheap, consider a fork, or barter for a bigger pita.
IKEA is a monster. Really. You could easily spend the majority of a day walking around aimlessly and taking in the scenery. Even when I'm not in the market for any big ticket items, I enjoy seeing the rooms they have set up to showcase their products. It never fails that I'm walking out of there with a least one or two gadgets. The overall concept of the store is great. While it may not be the highest quality of furniture, it does its job well and certainly can be used in most decorating styles. Some items are moderately priced. Others (ie; lounge chairs) seem overpriced to me. But that's the beauty of IKEA--you can pick and choose. I don't think there is another store on this planet that i say, "Wouldn't this look great?" more than I do in IKEA. Wild horses couldn't drag me away :)
Some of my girlfriends coworkers recently invited us to join them here to sing karaoke. 

Many years ago this was a great little place called the Village Pub. That was back in the 70s. I once had dinner with Joyce Dewitt here.

Well the days of dining with celebrities here are long gone. Let's flash ahead 30 plus years to my current review.

I work down on the strip and knowing the kind of riff raff that hangs out around here I wasn't expecting much from this experience. As soon as I stepped into the place my expectations were fulfilled. The place was dingy and crowed with the typical prostitutes, drug pushers, losers and other assorted parasites of society you'd expect to see in a bad part of town.

The place has the worst sound system of any karaoke bar I've ever visited.

The staff was slow and seemed bored with their jobs.

Despite all these positive attributes I think I'll refrain from visiting again.
J'y suis allée en février dernier et retourné en avril. J'adore la bière artisanale de ce brasseur de quartier. Ils ont quand même beaucoup de choix et ce que j'ai adoré c'est le fait que les deux fois que j'ai été leur menu de bière avait changée. Le staff est très amical et connaissent bien leur bières. Si jamais on est pas sûre de notre choix, ils peuvent toujours nos offrir un verre de dégustation. 

J'ai adoré leur IPA tropical..quelque chose de même....ça goûtte, comme le nom le dit...LE TROPICAL! Sérieux très bon! L'espace est sombre, mais va avec le mood de la place. On entends bien la musique et on s'entend bien parler. L'endroit est populaire, il va peut être falloir attendre un peu pour avoir de la place...sinon il y a toujours le bar.
I used to think Tropicana was a dump but after the remodel, the place looks great! It looks really clean and modern inside, definitely a place you want to hang out.  Our party checked out the pool and had a great time! Good size pool, swim up blackjack, bar..I mean what else could you ask for? Food options looked amazing (I didn't eat here but saw all the places). A couple of friends had a room here and the room was also very nicely remodeled! Love gambling here for the cheap tables but looks nothing like before...go check it out! I think I might stay here next time I'm in Vegas!
Found this place by accident at the fantastic indoor swap meet. Now I can't get enough! I live across town and drive each weekend to enjoy the empanadas. Totally worth the drive, and George is always happy to serve you. Also try the most amazing chimichurri sauce!!
If your looking for a great hidden food find, this is it!!!! I love, Love Empanadas!!
Out of all the places I've ever attended a conference, this one is top notch! Facility is nice and clean, staff is friendly and the food\/beverage supply is endless! The food is really awesome (they feed you every 2 hours) and I always get my fill when I come here. Conference rooms\/space are very spacious and nice. My only complaint would be the location...it's not exactly easy to find but is in a nice business complex. Overall, this place rocks!
I've experienced two very helpful female sales associates' assistance and one not so helpful, and I've also been flat out ignored by other salespeople.  Note that the security guards aren't salesmen and cannot unlock cases and show items.

One blonde saleswoman (who seemed like management) impressed me so much with her service, giving me a Cartier catalog\/book in a nice Cartier shopping bag. that I came back the next day to buy the keychain I had been eyeing.  The sales associate who sold it to me was not as stellar with her customer service though.

Another time, one of the female salespeople scrounged through all of their under stock cabinets (which involved kneeling on the carpet) to locate a wallet style for me.  I was pleasantly surprised she didn't feel it was "beneath" her to do so.

Cartier's quality is extremely high, and you pay for it!  I do personally feel they are a little more special than Tiffany, yet the downside to that is the brand is also more unapproachable.  Compared to their other competitors in the mall, they are less industrial than Montblanc, less flashy than Bulgari, and less "sporty" than Omega (and with a heavier fine jewelry focus than Omega, who kind of "tacks on" their jewelry and doesn't even display their leather goods).  Unlike David Yurman and Tiffany, they don't carry an accessible silver jewelry line (besides men's cufflinks).  While their leather goods might compete against the likes of Bottega Veneta, Gucci, Prada, and Louis Vuitton, their main focus is their fine jewelry, along with their watches.

Minus one star for hit or miss customer service and another for their Neiman Marcus-like practice of not following mall hours and closing early.  Oh, and they stopped making their charity support jewelry last I checked, which is a pity since it was relatively affordable.
The food was everything but bacon, the service was poor, polite but took a long time to take the order and even forgot one order, the drinks were okay but nothing to visit again, finally the place is real comfy.
So many of Town Square's eateries are awash in tired stereotypes. Not Killer Shrimp!
Upon being seated you're promptly greeted by a server. Look the drink menu over, try one or two;)  May I suggest the Sugar Plum or The Westside! Take a bite of one of Killer Shrimp's creations....seafood salad, 'peel & eat' shrimp, Asian pork drum sticks and finish it off with Killer Shrimp's S'mores! 
A punch of flavor and taste is a serious understatement.  The dishes are delicious!
Really enjoyed the sales & reasonably priced organic goods.

Our home cooking is nearly all produce so sprouts is ideal due to variety, price & freshness.  Heirloom tomatoes $1.98 a lb, hatch green chilies $.79, organic carrots $2.99 a 5 pound bag... the delicious steals keep going on.

Saw a nice manager checking in with his associates & customers which is rare these days!  Cashiers courteous & accurate.

Thank you sprouts!!
Being that this is the only "kawaii" merchandise store in the entire state of Pennsylvania , it's definitely something new to you all. It was a refresher to finally see this emerge when I had been collecting many things online. I liked the large variety here but it's for sure overpriced lol. eBay is much cheaper and asian markets all over California sell tons of this stuff without costing ten arms and legs. I occasionally bought items from here that I like so I don't wait for shipping. Pens are overpriced. I mean 9 dollars for a pencil geez. I can buy that from japan for like $4. They indeed sell lovely products and it's always my favorite shop but I've experienced much better. To a Pennsylvanian though, this is all you got. It's better than nothing, and it's also great for small gift ideas ~
Not a bad place to stay... Close to lots of stuff. Ruth Chris' across the street and you can get it delivered to your room. Small kitchen with the basics. Dishwasher, full size fridge and 2 cooktop. It's like a small apartment. Laundry room on 3rd & 7th floor. Pool & gym in lower level, outdoor basketball "court". Outdoor patio area with grill and lounging area. Full service bar with a few beers on tap. Breakfast served daily. Decent selection, fresh and clean. Rooms are clean and well appointed. No complaints.
Can't speak for the food, I just dropped by for some drinks.  $21 for a pitcher of domestic? wow, me thinks not. 

Yelpers here say the food is good but if I'm going to a sports bar, I'm going to watch sports and have beer.  And at that price for beer, well, let's just say they better have some good food to keep people coming back at these prices.
I got talked into eating here, against by better judgment, and my expectations\/gut was right. I don't know why, but I just didn't want to eat here, for some reason the menu did not wow me, but because I like to make others happy (the people pleaser I am) I came here. 

I opted for the green fettuccine with mushrooms, peas and parmesan truffle sauce. Eh - just okay. I'm not sure why, gain I can't place my finger on why, but it just didn't wow me. It tasted kind of greasy and not at all like parmesan sauce. The portions are pretty small and when you are spending $27 for a pasta, it should be out of the world! 

For dessert, I ordered some lemon thing. I call it a think because I can't even explain what it is (neither could the waiter), it was so nasty that I took one bite and sent it back. 

The decor to the place is kind of plain, but the staff is amazing. Our waiter was one of the best I have ever had in a long long time. He gets five stars!!!!
WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING

I can't do zero 0 stars I definitely would. So far this is the worst Mexican food ever, horrible taste everything frozen from a f... Can.  how dare you guys to call this Mexican food?? I travel to Mexico and other USA state's restaurants many. I have a passion for food my family owns restaurants and definitely this is the worst food preparation EVER. I Order many plates all disgusting tacos, TORTAS, STAKE, MAHI MAHI IT'S NOT EVEN MEXICAN ALL where serve cold and same meat I order mix. Beans no salt, not taste no nothing
All frozen meat who knows how long this people keep their food in refrigerator.

Who ever is giving Like or positive reviews I have two questions. You haven't try Real Mexican food from scratch.? 
Employees are doing their own reviews.

Please try to go to real Mexican cuisine then you will change your mind and go back to yelp after you know tequilas  and taqueria Pronto! 

Not even free will recommended to go there. Sucks.
Yay!  Good German food in Charlotte!  Traveling accordion player.  Attentive service.  Jagerschnitzel.  Pretzel rolls.  Need I say more?
Great service. Speedy too! Always come to them for oil changes. I have never used them for major maintenance, but I also haven't had to do any yet either. My car is 11 years old with nearly all oil changes being performed by various jiffy lube locations and it is still running great!
I am loving how things are shaping off of me!  ;) I highly recommend the cavi-lipo if you're looking to get rid of problem areas. Just be patient and know that it's going to take more than a few sessions for optimal results despite what you saw on Dr. Oz lol. I just think that everyone must respond differently. I've visited Kim 5 times now and will probably book another 7 with this particular procedure. It's well worth it!!!!

I also love the decor, cleanliness, and soothing aroma that welcomes you when you come in. Kim is fully booked (that just shows you people are really hooked and that it works!) so I'd recommend booking at least 3 appointments at a time. Enjoy the new you whether it's skinnier, smoother, or less hairy! ;) Thanks Kim!
It was a rainy cold night  when we ventured out for Queen Citys Restaurant week. Evoke a fairly new restaurant was set back in the  Le Méridien Charlotte. We had wanted to try it for some of the Unique new items on the 3 course menu. It was very quiet and not busy on this Thursday Night, which is kind of strange during Restaurant Week, but we were nicely surprised. We started out with an extra appetizer which was the Truffle Pommes , yes french fries with truffle salt and a house made ailoi which was delicous! We then varied which item  each of us ordered ( party of two ) so we could taste all the different items. We loved the Pasta  Alla Chitarra which was duck egg Carbonara, it was a nice size portion and the flavor was spot on! The Jerusalem Artichoke Parsnip Bisque was heavenly. One of the Unique things we recieved was a Salt tray, it was served with our Entree, which had Four different sea salts and each was a flavor explosion in your mouth! Really loved that! I got the Filet with Crispy Asparagus and My daughter got the Swordfish with Meyer Lemon and olives and salsify We topped off this dinner with their Salted Caramel Budino which was a wonderful rendition of one of my favorite desserts with homemade almond cookies on the side. Very modern, very chic and well worth the cost this is a great restaurant!
Great family run restaurant near Chinatown in a small plaza. The service was good and the food came out quick and hot. We order the Pho Tai which is rare beef noodle soup ($6.95 USD) along with Egg rolls ($5.95 USD). The broth in the pho was very good and they used thin noodles. There was a lot of green onions, but since I am a fan I didn't mind. The egg rolls were delicious, very crunchy and complimented well with the lettuce wraps. We also ordered the Chicken Banh Mi to go which was very good. The sandwich was packed with meat and vegetables and served on a fresh baguette.
We randomly stumbled into this restaurant without any reviews or recommendations. It looks newly renovated and feels like a higher end Chinese restaurant. The service was good and spacious seating. We ordered the juicy pork steamed buns (10 per order), snow pea sprouts with pan fried oyster mushroom (very good and large portion), and Taiwan style three cup chicken  (very flavourful and paired well with a plain rice). We will be back to try more.
I was really excited to try this place after reading the reviews and it's fairly close to home. Upon entering the cashier was very friendly and helpful since we had never been before. We decided to dine in, and the young lady said she would bring our food as soon as it was ready. Once she brought our food I realized she had forgot our ranch no big deal except she only gave me one and I ask for another since we had two meals. She explained that would cost extra, so I ask then why would you ask if I wanted ranch when I ordered. She ended up giving it to me at no extra cost. I was just a little annoyed by that. The wings were nice and hot and had plenty of meat. And I was pleasantly surprised that the boneless wings were so tasty!! Normally I stay away from boneless because they are breaded so much and there's no meat; but not here!! I was a little disappointed to find the French fries were hot since the wings seemed to be so fresh. And next time if your not going to clean your celery at least cut off the dirty parts before serving to costumers. Thank god I didn't see the dirt until I was basically done eating or that would have ruined my appetite, seeing how they were on the side of my wings. Over all decent place I will be back to try again.
Pretty good sandwiches, and thin crust pizza. Dont care for their Chicago deep dish,stuffed,or pan style pizza,because it tastes like they use margerine in the crust instead of half margerine, half butter, which is the way I like the Chicago deep dish crust to be made. Try the Valentino, on thin crust,and it will spin your cap for sure,and they have a good italian beef sandwich,and sausage sandwich.Overall,its a bit pricey,but they do have some very good choices. They also charge 2.50 for a delivery fee!
Excellent red velvet cake with strawberry frosting was the hit of the party we attended. Not so sweet that it was hard to eat but just right! Also had a couple cookies that were great as well. Keep the excellent deserts coming!
Had the potential of being a "hidden gem" given its strange location in an unfrequented plaza right off the highway. Unfortunately, the young man at the checkout counter was so unfriendly, impatient, and bro-ish. Him and the other three male workers were literally standing around but not at all eager to explain the ordering process or answer any questions. What made it worse? I was literally the ONLY customer in the entire store! Take a little pride in your job. Geesh! Definitely wasn't a pleasant or welcoming experience. Too bad because my sandwich was actually decent.
After reading such rave reviews about this place I figured I had to check it out! The service here is fantastic! I was quickly greeted and seated. My server was also very knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered the vegetarian tostada and the spinach and cheese quesadilla both were delicious! The prices are very reasonable! I recommend this place if your looking for good inexpensive "comfort food".
This weekend we had a Bridal Shower - Upstairs - In the Private Room at The Wine Shop. Jon Sheesley , the Manager had talked with me a couple of times over the last three months and helped me plan and execute the MOST fantastic shower! . We also had a waiter who was so helpful and knowledgeable - Rich Williams ( I would ask for him if you were in the restaurant. The food was fantastic, we had Crab Cakes, Tuna Tartare in little Cones, Flatbreads, Brushettas, and Calamari!  We were allowed to decorate the tables and bring in our own added touches. I would highly recommend this for any event you would need a private room for. They can hold up to 35 or 40, we had 26 and were quite comfortable. It is consistently good as a wine shop and now we know its great as a private venue also!! Kudo's to Jon and Rich!!
Landmark is definitely a favorite place of mine the service is good the food is plentiful and the prices are low, it's not a super fancy place but a good old fashioned diner..
How lucky, how fortunate we are to live in a city like Edinburgh, and how much more so that it contains something as flawlessly beautiful as Grassmarket.

Broad and cobbled, Grassmarket lies glowing in the sun or sparkling in the rain, garlanded about with a bright wreath of independent shops, taverns, and hotels. It's home, too, to a regular market, which fills its central plaza with life and energy. During August, it becomes a hive of activity for those escaping the pressing throngs of the Royal Mile, busy in its own way but retaining a sense of mischief, fun, and self-identity that never quite gets erased by the descent of the hoards.

It was a beautiful day last time I sauntered around the Grassmarket area, and since I was early for a meeting I decided to just sit on one of the benches and do some work. To my amazement, there seemed to be an open BT Wifi connection; I'm not sure how stable it is because I tend to hotspot from my phone instead most of the time, rather than using open networks, but still. You could have knocked me down with a feather.

Oh, Grassmarket. What an agent of joy you are and shall ever remain.
I'm not always a fan of a limited menu, I don't want a tonne of options but Mr. Flamingo was a bit reserved. 

Having said that, I shared a couple of yummy dishes with my friend. Star for me was the gnocchi. It was like high end mac and cheese, I was scraping the plate with my fork. We also had a trout dish that was okay but certainly not disappointing. 

Nice wine selection, reasonable prices and a cozy atmosphere. Probably a good date spot!
Definitely my place to go to satisfy a burger craving. I usually get combo #1: Freshburger with all the fixings (4 oz beef patty, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and Freshburger sauce), drink, and upgrading the fries to a Poutine (which is fries covered with cheese curds and gravy) or California Fries (which is fries covered with sweet sauteed onions, cheese, and secret sauce). California fries are not featured on the menu but highly recommend it. They recently expanded so there is more seating, but still relatively small. Expect a bit of a wait during prime times.
I took my daughter here for her 21st birthday and what a mistake I made!!! We rented two rooms and to begin with the carpets were filthy in the room and hallways, one room the sofa a ripped lining which hung on the floor. The alarm clock made this really weird humming noise and I had to unplug the makeup mirror was broken and had no light as well as the base was broken so it listed to one side. When you flushed the toilet the outside sink gurgled for a few minutes. I asked for two non-smoking rooms and one stunk of cigarette smoke.

I stayed at the Rio for three days and one of my rooms was not cleaned for two consecutive days. When I called housekeeping they tried to say that we were in the room too long in the morning but we were up and out by 11AM each day. The Rio has two pools one with a waterfall and another that is heated were kid mainly enough themselves. This pool was absolutely disgusting. The white tile had a filthy black ring around it. Once I returned home I completed a survey sent to me by the Rio and I heard nothing but once I posted a review such as this one on Trip Advisor I was contacted by the Total Rewards depart offering me an upgraded room the next time I visited. 

This tells me that they in fact had cleaner and better maintained rooms if you pay extra, otherwise you get filth, no housekeeping services and tattered furniture. I would have to be out of my mind to throw good money behind bad. Keep in mind that the Rio "All Suites" Hotel and Casino is owned by Caesars Entertain who also own Caesars Palace, Paris, Bally the Quad and a number of other "Strip" properties. It's clear to me that the Rio is there "Ghetto" property where they clip poor unsuspecting tourists who are trying to save a few dollars while on vacation. 

Since my return I have done extensive research on this property and the vast majority of the negative reviews are consistent with the property being a poorly maintained dump. Don't believe the glitz and glamour that you see on the Discovery Channel this place truly sucks and management knows about it. 

BUYERS BEWARE!!!!
Small, community store with no drive through. Seating area can get very crowded and the lines can get long. The baristas are friendly enough and the service is consistent. Parking is available in the lot behind and to the side, but is shared with other businesses. Make sure you utilize Mobile Order & Pay through the Starbucks app to skip the line!
Nice club, but the music sucks, we came in from Montreal where Clubs are poppin!
They played Kattie Perry and that was not the worst of it, its really not a club club us from Montreal would consider a club!  This place is cool for high school kids and what we would call teenie boppers, but if your looking for a real club stay away from here!
maybe I'm biased because I live across the street... but I love this place! always a good deal on delicious margaritas, excellent artwork, great food options (small and large plates) and sweet games and atmosphere.
My boyfriend made me an appointment on my birthday for us to get pedicures. I was so excited to relax. I get pedicures every 2 weeks but we recently moved and I was looking for a new place anyway. After reading the reviews, I was even more excited. When I arrived, they were very busy. My boyfriend was running late and I told them that. I even offered for them to take some of the people who walked in and we could wait because it was my birthday and I had all day. My boyfriend arrived within the next 5 minutes and we were both rushed through our pedicure. We were not offered different options even though I could clearly see a "menu" in their bucket to pick from. I thought maybe they just didn't yes their menu, but then I saw them offer it to a lady right next to me. I enjoy getting sugar scrub, mask, and paraffin wax so I was VERY disappointed to not receive even a choice to add those on. Needless to say, I was not happy with my service and my birthday relaxation. I will not be coming back.
Je n'aime pas l'ambiance de  ce bar dansant , car on se sent  entassés quand on danse  et  le service à la clientèle est mauvais .La  musique est   bien  mais  les  gens  sur  piste  de  dance    sont  beaucoup  trop  agressif    quand  nous  sommes   des   femmes   . Je n'y retournerais   plus pour ces raisons  .
Okay store, not the best selection, certainly not the worst.  Staff leaves much to be desired, but cashiers are nice.
I'm writing this based purely on the dog park section. I'm not sure what the full restaurant is nice. The only reason we ever go here is because we can take the pups. They have a small doggie friendly menu and offer lots of bowls with water pitchers. The people food, however, is always lacking. Tiny portions and always feels half-assed. I've heard nothing but excellent things about the inside restaurant, though!
I think the business name is misleading; Daquila Hair Color Studio is also a great place to get a cut!

My partner has been getting his cuts here for a year or so with great results. I finally decided to give them a try myself. I made my appointment with Nicole for a Friday, which they call a clinic day because the owner, Deborah, sort-of councils the staff while they work. As I understood it, services are cheaper on Fridays because of this. At first, it seemed like it'd be a stressful environment, but I found that having the two of them assess my hair was not an inconvenience, but a benefit, as a second opinion was always on hand! Deborah helped design the plan for my hair and Nicole executed it with ease. As another reviewer mentioned, she really took her time; that really makes a client feel special. 

I have never seen this place get very busy, and I have to wonder why because their staff is qualified, their prices are fair, and the space is bright and very pleasant.
I wasn't crazy about Pinky's north. Liked the idea maybe it was an off day. Got kind of sick off greasy food. Maybe I'll try the one on Morehead.
Yoforia delivers fro yo to the masses in Southpark Mall. It's a self serve spot with 12 flavors. Unfortunately, two were down for cleaning when I visited. You can sample as many flavors as you like but you need to ask the people at the counter for the cups. They keep them hidden, probably to deter people from just snagging samples and leaving without a purchase. 

I sampled a few and enjoyed most of them. Most of the ones I sampled had a really nice, smooth consistency (read, not icy!). They had a nice mixture of sweet and tart flavors. They had 4 tart flavors out of the 10 they were serving at the time Which is more than most places offer. The thing that got me... TARO fro-yo. Oh yum yum!! It was a nice consistency, which an appealing purple hue. The taro flavor was mild but ever present. I also enjoyed the key lime and cheesecake swirled together.

Like most self-serve fro-yo places, they only have one size cup (large!). So, be careful filling it up. Otherwise, you will, very easily, have an $8+ cup in your hands. The toppings bar was messy and the fruit didn't look all that appealing. I opted to pass on toppings, as the taro was good all on its own.

So, my biggest complaint... Price! I know they have to pay the rent, which is probably outrageous being in a mall, but come on! They charge about 10 cents more per ounce than comparable self-serve fro yo places. Oh well... I'll be back just for the taro fro-yo.
I have only three words for this place. Yum. Yum. and Yum.
I'm trying to think of something this place doesn't have. It's too hard, moving on.

When you are getting married and most of what you are planning is DIY, having large selection on things helps a lot, and when you can get almost anything at 40% off that helps even more. Michales and Jo-Anns has some good wedding stuff, but they also have a lot of the same wedding stuff.

This particular visit, we went in to buy some fabric, we are making our own table runners, and since we are doing "family style" seating with three 8ft banquet tables long, we need a bunch of pieces of long cut fabric. We went in on a Sunday, they had the fabric but not enough, not to worry, they cna order it and it will get there in less than a week. That is better than any online retailer could offer and cheaper too. I haven't even walked all the way around the store because I'm not into much of that stuff, but it is a great store.
Another update on Greco Fresh Grille as they've been open now for about six months. We stopped by last Saturday around 3PM and the place was hopping. Great to see they're doing such a brisk business.

They've added a few new items to their decor, and a few new specials to their menu. Pastitsio was listed as a special with the description of "Greek Lasagne" - sounded good but I was there for the gyro and fries. 

The food was great, but I wish they'd offer a combo with side items other than fries. Perhaps some hummus or a small greek salad. It's so easy to go there and get a gyro and fries, and then leave feeling like you've eaten something as heavy as 5 Guys next door.

The owner is there every time I visit, and he stopped by to check on how things were going. This is still a winner of a place to me. It's exactly what I'd hoped for when they opened.
Allow me to start by saying: I have never been treated so well in a bar before. We came in on a regular Monday night and had a blast. The staff was excellent, we were greeted and seated instantly. Our nice host brought us their signature ice cream. a few minutes later, our cocktail waitress arrived and explained the menu flawlessly. The atmosphere is nice, the music selection is great, especially if you're into Rockabilly\/punk\/Ska, as I am. Our waitress was excellent and the drinks were even better. out of this world. If I could leave more than 5 stars, I totally would.
Went out here with my grandson for an event called A Day with Thomas. Apparently Thomas is a cartoon that he's a big fan of.

We had a great time out there. The staff were all friendly and helpful. 

I would have given it a 5 if it wasn't for the huge crowds. I'm sure that means it was a successful event for them, but crowds aren't really my thing. I'm sure I"d probably given it a 5 if I visited on a non event day.

The old trains were interesting and I would have enjoyed spending more time there learning more about the history of the railroad...but it was my grandsons day and it was a pleasure seeing him have a good time.
This is by far one of the best place in Phoenix to get a great burrito. The place is an old house with a small dining area inside for those warm Phoenix days but has seating outside for those perfect nights. When it's comes to their burritos they are amazing. I've tried them all and I have to recommend the pork in been chile. It's one of my favorites. I haven't tried their breakfast yet but it's next up. Service is quick and they have great customer service.
The airport overlook is a little out of the way, but once you find the signs it's easy to get to. Unfortunately, planes on the runway nearest the overlook tend to be taking off, not landing. This means that they take off usually about halfway down the runway, a ways off from the overlook. If you can get to the overlook when the winds are out of the south instead of the north, I imagine you'll get a much better view of planes landing rather than taking off.

There are picnic tables for a nice picnic, and plenty of benches right at the front of the overlook. It's a great place to visit on a sunny afternoon.
Solid fast casual food.  The chicken sandwiches and burgers are always moist and flavorful (as they should be with all their calorie bomb glory).  The rosemary\/garlic\/herb fries are addictive (you really cannot have just one).  Their shakes are probably some of the better ones I've had; not hand-scooped diner or fancy burger place level but definitely above McDonald's and company.

The wait is not bad at all, they have fantastic parking in their strip mall, and it's been clean with friendly service every time I've gone.  It's not really a destination for me, but it's definitely a safe choice for a good quick bite.
Long time reader of Cibo reviews, first time diner and now writer.  Our group of 4 headed there Saturday night, and were immediately charmed by the atmosphere with the cute patio seating and white lights.  We arrived at 7ish and got a drink at the bar (a plus - Nimbus beer from Tucson!  And a $5 glass of Pinot Grigio!)  before being seated outside in about 20 minutes.  

Our waiter was super friendly and helpful, suggesting the indecisive BF order half Prosciutto Crudo and half Salsiccia.  The rest of us ordered the Margherita - I know, I know, original.  More points to the waiter, who didn't look at my friend like a weirdo when she ordered her Margherita sans the cheese. Also, there was one woman who seemed assigned to water distribution only, and was on top of refilling our glasses.  And for me, that was every 5 minutes.  

We started with the Caprese Salad, which was different but oh so delicious.  The cherry tomatoes were soaked in the pesto, oregano, and olive oil and were very flavorful - great with the mozzarella.  I could've used more basil leaves or arugula, but whatev.   The pizza's were mmmmm, mmmmm good but didn't blow me away.  Again, I could've used more basil leaves, but my fellow margherita eaters took theirs off, so again, personal preference.  

I would definitely return for the overall ambience and uniqueness of Cibo, as well as the friendly staff and owners.  Definitely a downtown treat!!
This cafe is absolutely beautiful. Once walks into the incredible warm atmosphere and a delicious soothing smell. The furniture is charming and makes me want to go back and try out all the different nooks and crannies so I can claim a favourite spot!

The staff are very friendly and were kind enough to help me choose something. I tried the snowman's surprise which was different to anything i've ever had before. Perhaps it's an acquired taste but in the hot winter it's absolutely refreshing. 

This is the perfect place for a sweet afternoon conversation with friends or a date. Definitely going back and would recommend to everyone.
Everything was awesome!  My 11 year old did a class and my son and I climbed.  Everything was well taken care of and clean.  The staff was very helpful and so nice.  I can't wait to go back!
I went in with no appointment and I got out within 15 minutes. The facility is super clean, staffs are friendly and the tech I had was very skilled. I have small veins that rolls and it is extremely hard to get blood sample out of me (especially when I fast for 8 hours). I was sent to quest because the facility I visited earlier failed to get a sample. This lady from hawaii was confident and she made it first try. It happened so quick, I didn't even feel the discomfort or pain. I will come back and ask for her if I have to do this again !
I got the chicken burger and my girl friend got the bacon cheeseburger. Originally we ordered a combo with the burgers but we cancelled one of the combos later finding out they didn't take credit. So he let us pay some in cash and some in debit. But even tho we paid the price of one chicken burger combo and a bacon cheeseburger alone, he still gave us the fries and drink so the customer service was fantastic. Now for the food.... ONE of the BEST burgers I've ever had. The chicken patty was super crispy but still juicy on the inside and the vegetables were fresh. The fries were clearly fresh by the way it looked after being fried. Definitely recommend this place
Great place, good donuts, I'm not even a donut person. 

This place is right across the street from us so it is really convenient for us to get a quick breakfast and some coffee. I usually get the Cinnamon roll cause its the size of a Frisbee and dunk it in coffee. 

They have a pretty good selection of donuts and coffee, really beats the hell out of krispy kreme.
Its more closer for me coz I move its like a 10 mins drive and 24 hours too.. I have the black card and the only thing is I need to transfer my location. Its bigger facility and I really don't need the classes coz I do my own work out. Its really clean nice staff.
We found Buzz via a coupon after they first opened, and since then we've forgone all other BBQ places in NW Vegas for them.  They concentrate on the BBQ and they do a great job with it.  Standouts for us are the brisket (you can eat it with just a fork) and the sausage, but you can't go wrong with the ribs, pulled pork, or chicken either.

For sides, the coleslaw is great -- it's not mayo based -- and the baked beans have big chunks of ham in them, as they should!

This is hands-down one of the best BBQ places in town, and certainly the best in NW Vegas.
Purchased food using a Group On. First was impressed with the staff. They provided great and fast service for the amount of food we purchased. Picked up food for 18 people. The food was excellent and great tasting. We covered the majority of meats they had to offer. The BBQ wasn't overly smokey which tends to happen at many places. Definitely will come back here for BBQ. Great place if you are getting good for a large group.
Oh. Mygod. Ohmygod. 

I thought the first time I came here and only enjoyed coffee that it was spectacular. Then I came back for the crepes. Consider my mind blown.

Not only does the outside have major curb appeal (LOVE the use of color), but you can sit at a coffee bar or outside... or in this whole other room. Come on. With that many seating options, there's something for everyone.

One night I was there, a movie was playing outside. This is the kind of place people can come back to. And the kind of place that Phoenix desperately needs downtown.

The stars reached their highest notch though when I went against my gut instinct and ordered the peanut butter cup crepe. See, I'm a huge fan of the Reese's cup. However, I feel it is nearly impossible to imitate. No one gets that flavor combination right and I end up being sadly disappointed.

If this is your fear too... order the peanut butter cup crepe from Jobot. It was like taking a bunch of Reese's and melting them in a crepe. I will still full from dinner, but I'll be damned if I didn't eat that entire thing.

The staff was super friendly, having conversations with a friend and I as we sat at the counter and indulged our sweet tooth ( is sweet teeth a word). I'll be back.. as often as I can manage :)
Went to this a few months ago and am just now getting around to reviewing it.  A fun and entertaining trip through Vegas musical history with a very talented cast of singers, dancers, and musicians!  Definitely worth seeing.  Whether you're a local, or a tourist just passing through, you'll have fun with this show.  The only thing I didn't like was that I couldn't take pictures, as... come to think of it, I can't remember anything specific about the show.  In fact, a lot of Vegas shows have this policy, though I can't understand why.  Wouldn't pictures promote the show and encourage people to go see it?  In any case, a fun show worth seeing.
Friendly staff. Clean place. 

Visited with one of the employees while waiting for our pizza. Didn't realize how long this business had operated in Vegas. Will definitely be back. I enjoy places that gave a bit of history to them.
Some things are a blessing in disguise--such as the time I attempted to relocate to Pittsburgh and found a somewhat decent apartment in the North Side.  I took a tour of the place.  I was hopeful the cat smell would be addressed but when the guy said "Oh, you can smell that?" I should have known then.  The apartment needed painted--badly, but I was willing to deal so that the stress of relocation could go away.  The unit also had no window treatments, no air conditioning, and did I mention the cat smells?  

On a Friday, I told them I was interested in the apartment, they told me to mail my security deposit check that day.  I followed direction and mailed it.  I made plans for moving.  They never called to tell me my rent check wasn't recieved on Saturday or the following Monday.  I had to email them to request a copy of my lease when I was told  "The apartment is no longer available, someone came in today and gave a security deposit".  Interesting--so when I asked the office that past Friday they told me not to bring in my check--that mail would suffice.  Something doesn't sound right here.  Their lack of communication also cost me an additional $100 in non-refundable moving expenses as I had put down a deposit with a moving company.  

Definately one of the more frustrating things to happen to me during my relocation, but based off the condition the apartment was in, coupled with these poor reviews, I should be counting my blessings.
Date & Time: Tuesday,  July 21, 2015

I was really craving hotpot because Lu Gi's in california was a life changer.  I came across this place and decided to give this place a go. 

This place is all-you-can-eat, you get to choose two soup bases (we opt for regular and spicy), the meat, vegetables,  and other items we self serve in fridges, and a sauce station (you can build your own sauce for dipping). 

I came during lunch because after reading some of the reviews, I was doubting it would be as great. I was wrong, this place is really fucking good. I can just only imagine what they serve during dinner time. I created my own sauce (peanut sauce, soy sauce, hot chili oil, a squeeze of lemon,  and seseme oil) and had ponzo just by itself. It was so bomb. 

If you're not into the whole waiting for your meat to cook in boiling soup, then this isnt for you. Trust me, by the end of your meal the soup is so full of flavor when you wait to put your noodles in at the end, best noodles you'll ever have. 

Price:
2 lunch all you can eat
2 waters
=$36 & some change
Awesome location, building, amenities and idea. But the service is very bad... Seems like they have never worked in the industry. Everyone seems so scattered brained and lost. Had a reservation at 8:15 did not get seated until almost 9pm. 20 min for drinks, then another 20 min to take our order. Food was very bad compared to most regular old bars. They need to keep it simple. Take notes from Hooples across the river who does simple good bar food... I really hope the Metro Parks figure this out because the place could be a real awesome place. But Right now Ill only be back for the location every once in a while.
I haven't actually ever disliked anything I've gotten here.  Lately it's been mostly takeout, and my go to is the pulled pork cuban.  Filling and tasty.  The service here is sometimes spotty, but I think it has less to do with the competent (in my experience) wait staff and more to do with the face that every time I've visited it's been a ghost town.  

Plenty of good seats still (always) available during the weekly lunch crush.  

Good things here:
pulled pork
wings
ribs
sweet potato stix

Nice break from my usual seemingly perpetual asian-inspired menu.
Comme le nom le dit attendez-vous à être torchés...

L'ambiance est semblable à un bar de région. (Ne pas prendre mal...je m'explique...) Dans le sens que tout le monde est friendly et il y a des classiques Québecois et que le monde chante la chanson des Colocs ou Éric Lapointe haut et fort... Vous savez ce genre de bar où la soirée et tranquile et ensuite tout le monde devient amis, ça danse sur les tables, ça crit et tout le monde est content, même celui qui avait un air de beux au début de la soirée? Ben c'est ça...MOI J'AIME! 

La serveuse très très trop joyeuse et sympa... Ça nous donne le sourire et envie de faire le party avec elle aussi...Plusieurs choix de bière yeah Alors voilà, j'ai aimé!
Expect to wait and stand in line for brunch. They only have one cashier so it takes a while to order and receive your food. 

Very hipster, artsy feel to it. Serve your own water and coffee at a beverage station near the coffee bar. Food was ok but not the best crepes I've ever had and nothing stood out as fabulous. They do have a unique menu but there just weren't a ton of items that I was dying to try. 

Be aware they close at 2pm on Sundays.
Received Valentines flowers from my husband... Sweethearts bouquet ordered thru FTD...hubby paid for the "Better" selection at $54.99 + tax & delivery & I got the worst!  This bouquet is supposed to have 10 roses and have burgundy mini carnations not pink.  I can handle the pink carnations it came with, but 3 roses really!?  Their "Good" selection says it comes with 7 stems of roses.  Even if there was a shortage of roses due to the holiday they should have called him to see if he wanted to replace them with something else.   Apparently they can't deliver a new bouquet today so they took $20 off...what the hell?  That's still a rip off!  These should be completely free!  Good job at ruining a sweet gesture, thieves.
Bon   déjeuner    goûteux     ayant   beaucoup   de  saveur  !!!   Je  vais  y   retourner  c'est  sûr
Pizza is pretty good, but the rest of the food seems to be frozen. Don't eat in the restaurant if you like any actual service. No wait staff at all and the guys working are clueless. I asked for hot water and one of the guys said "we don't have any hot water" and I asked him to boil some. Also no changing tables in either bathroom.
Food was not bad (3\/5) but service was poor (1\/5). We have come before and thought the food was quite good. Portion of meat seemed much smaller.  

This time we ordered 2 drinks, (roasted milk tea and apple green tea),  with lunch specials and both did not taste good. Even so,  we kept one and asked to exchange the other. While one waitress said ok and was getting our coke,  the other waitress said not to. She then came and told us she cannot because our apple green tea was already made but will give us a 'discount' . I asked to take it off the bill and clearly it didn't happen but we did get $. 30 off our bill. Thank you (not really) and won't be back nor will we recommend to anyone. So many places to eat that are equally good if not better.
MY FAVORITE BOOKSTORE by campus. I great place to go to resale your books after the term. They also trade old books for products (books,t-shirts, etc.). But what i like the most are the two men that work there (owner & manger?) are Super nice and down to earth. Good job guys.
The food it's great. the bread they give with your meal is yummy as well.The building is beautiful. in many ways I feel like this is a five start place. except when it comes to service. they seem to have a couple of great people and a lot of people that don't seem bought it. Because of the I don't care of can't be bothered attitude it great impacts the service. 
It is sad, because I never had a bad experience at there Decatur and Flamingo location.
Lowering their star rating for having shelves full of expired, moldy mochi.  There is no red bean mochi, and all the peanut mochi is expired, with one package having a spiderweb-like white mole inside.  Some of the sesame mochi had expiration dates of 2015!
The mr. and I stopped here for a quick bite on the way to the grocery store.  We dined in this time, which had its ups and downs.

I opt for the 2 shredded beef taco plate and the Mr. tried the shrimp tacos.  We grabbed our drink, chips and salsa and sat.  The mild and hot sauces were very good causing me to up my star eating from last time.  I'm typically a "hot" chick- but even the mild had me going back for thirds.

The dining area was slightly better than a fast food spot and one table near the soda fountain had two rags laying out.  The floor was not very clean near the fountain either.

Our platters arrived which looked yummy- nice size servings of rice and beans.  My tacos were crisp and not stingy! The beef was a good consistency, typical lettuce and finely shredded cheese.  The only downside is when you see oil drip on your plate as you eat. 

His shrimp tacos were definitely healthier as the corn tortilla was not fried.  The shrimp were freshly cooked though quite small.  He also opted for whole (not refried) beans which were fresh & homemade.

We will be back for the salsa and to try more menu options at this hidden gem.
I don't have a big review for this place cause I only stopped in for a couple drinks one night after a suns game, but the atmosphere definitely made me want to return for a meal.
I've hiked this trail a few times. I wouldn't say it's one of the most scenic hikes in the area but it is beautiful.

Watch out for those switchbacks on the way up they seem to never end.

Once you reach the top Bonanza Peak is not too far off.
We had very good dealings with this dealership. Steve, our salesman was very knowledgeable and very laid back and not pushy at all. I would highly recommend this dealership
I went to Crust with a group of friends on a weeknight. The ambience of the restaurant is fun but pretty tightly packed. I saw a gentleman with a walker literally not able to get around the tables to use the restroom. Our waiter was nice- other servers filled drinks and brought out our order. We were never told about any drink specials or what type of beer they have on tap until my fiancé asked, which was after we got our salads. One of my friends did not like the anti-pasta salad (I didn't try it) and they did take it off the bill. I was able to try Caesar salad with garlic bread, individual rustica pizza and a bite of the chicken parmigana meal. I liked everything I had- the shape of the pizza was the one thing that threw me off. If you haven't been, go check out this place just to see what I'm talking about. I took a picture and so did every table around us who ordered individual pizzas. I honestly wasn't blown away by the flavor of the food- it was good but not that good. I would probably come back but it's nowhere close to me so it would be for a special occasion.
A wonderful aromatherapy treatment with scalp enhancement has prepared me well for my last night in Vegas. I had a male therapist and he was amazing! The spa is beautiful and comfortable but not as quiet in the common areas as others I have visited, which is the only reason I don't give them five stars. (I'm a lone spa-goer so enjoy the peace and quiet.) There are heated stone lounges that were a great start and the rainwater showers - spectacular!
Is it a $1 store or is it .99 cents please enter a laughing emoji of sorts:)
Fortunately, there is no shortage of more-for-less chain stores.  When I 'pop' in for buying envelopes I can not help but peruse EVERY, single aisle.  My initial reasoning is all out the door, as was my intention for spending $3 give or take.  Well, the take was on me- $30 after every aisle. 
I've learned random name brands do appear in the shelves!  Yes, the expiration dates are good for another or more!  Last month I couldn't believe my eyes (yes, I rubbed them) thought it was a dream;) Illy coffee bottles!  I purchased the entire case of the latte.  That's correct, that empty shelf space was my doing.  
This place also has some decent tchotchkes.  Party goods abound here.  Those seasonal holidays are dedicated to an entire aisle of irresistible decorations. Last week, no not Christmas decorations but HALLOWEEN decor and costume makings!  I purchased some lovely masks.  Three exactly.  No, don't know what I'm planning for a costume.  I do however, have the masks;)  
In the back corner they have produce, fresh and nicely priced.  The refrigerator goods near by, some surprising brands on occasion- these dates usually expire within a few months.  For example, I'm an East coaster (my accent does not give it away)!  Really, it doesn't ha ha ha;)  I immediately recognized the red and white packaging- Breakstone's sour cream!  I was thrilled, well giddy truthfully.  I purchased the remaining three and then walked over to produce and picked up some potatoes for baking;). Guess what was for dinner that evening;)
This location just remodeled by way of redesigning the aisles and adding even more merchandise.  Good grief!  
One will always find more than they need here, without even needing it;)
There are not many fabric stores in the area anymore so it is nice that this one is so close. I have been to this location a couple of times recently to buy fabric for chairs that I have been redoing. They had a great selection of what I needed. I would only go to this store when they are having a big sale or you have a coupon, otherwise it is a bit pricey. My last visit here did not go very well. There was a discrepancy in the pricing (it was discounted) and the cashier argued with me about it. I'm not the type that goes into a situation knowing I'm absolutely right so I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt! Alas, a calculator proved I was correct and even after that was figured out, she still did not honor the price that was supposed to be given. I probably won't be going back here because of that...I left the store happy to have my fabric but very frustrated that I had overpaid and not received great customer service.
Finding a quality computer technician in today's world is honestly harder than you would think.  We've been through several tech's and lately I've been forced to do all our upgrades personally.  Finally, I stumbled on  Big Byte Computers.  I had them upgrade the RAM and hard drives in our server for our company.  It was an unusual situation as they were dealing with a 12 year old computer.  Michael was great, he was very helpful in offering solutions on areas we are able to upgrade with the old computer.  We opted to install 2 separate 1 TB drives (1 as a backup) and then some additional RAM.  Since we use our server 6 days a week they were able to do after hours work (at add'l cost) and work late Saturday to upgrade the entire system.  I picked it up from them Sunday morning and I could't be happier.  They delivered what they promised and went above and beyond by working off hours for us.

I'll go to them for all our future computer needs.  Michael has been very helpful.
I love this whole office.  It's warm and welcoming in a very genuine way.  Dr. Nelson is low-keyed and knows his stuff.  And Wendy is by far the best hygienist ever.  I recently moved to central Phoenix and actually tried several other dental offices in the area which I will not name.  I'm no longer looking.
Not much parking and I hear there's always a wait. Never had a wait for a Mexican spot before. That's a by product of a small place and solid foot. Had the chicken and cactus. Definitely would get it again. Salsa and beans weren't bad. The chips werent my fav. Live music and traditional atmosphere. May come again if I'm in the area.
Can't blame this place for always being busy and they are worth the wait! Definitely our go to place in the summer for Korean cold noodles (the best in town) and another must order is the kimchi Jjim (aka pork belly with whole kimchi).
This mall is the equivalent of metro center now-a-days.  Honestly I don't recommend leaving your vehicle unattended.

This is the type of mall that the people with money avoid unless it's a restaurant on the outer mall areas, or in n out.

The Starbucks here even sucks.

Probably the best thing is the shoe department in Dillard's downstairs at the north entrance.
Attention all business owners:  Playing KYOT in your establishment may result in the automatic deduction of one star.  The aural assault of elevator music redux is an offensive to every fiber of my being.  It penetrates my ear balls and leaves me with a slight tic.  I am not the only person suffering from this affliction.  Consider yourself warned.

Other than blaring tunes to haunt my soul, the Chicago Gyro place is a rock solid choice for a mash up of Mediterranean and Chicago dawgs.  The menu is gimungous and really pretty intimidating.  Luckily I can keep chipping away at it by ordering something different each time, because the food really is pretty inexpensive.  It'll run you about six bucks for a gyro meal deal that comes with fries and a drink, and around eight for the gyro plate that comes with hummus and other deliciousness.  

My only beef, aside from the irrational hatred of Kaaay-Whhhy-Oooooh-Teeee smoooooth jaaaazz, is that the gyros are a little on the dry side and underdressed for my liking.  They are very generous with the meat here and the pitas are top notch, but they only slap, like, a single tomato slice down, and then load that madre up with onions and a tiny squirt of sauce along the bottom.  Now I appreciate a well packed gyro.  By all means, meat it up, but squirt a little of that shit on the top and side of the pita to lubricate my meat hole. (Don't go there.)  Cucumbers would also be a pleasant addition, sirs and madams. (Again, don't go there.)

Anyhoodle, I'm doling out a solid three stars.  You fill my tummy and leave me quite satisfied.
Food looks pretty tasty.

Unfortunately, I'll never know for sure. This place, from a service standpoint, is garbage.

Walked in with the hubs (last summer) and granted it was busy. However, I've walked into many busy places (busier, in fact) and was at least acknowledged. 

Tip for future restaurant owners: have a popular place with like 2 people working on a Saturday! Cool? Cool.

Had to ask where to sit after standing around for a few minutes. Was told, "sit anywhere". Mmk. Looked around and saw two chairs at the end of a long table against the wall.

So we sat next to people we didn't know. And we awkwardly sat. And sat. AND SAT.

No waitress. No waiter. No water. No order. No food. NO SQUAT.

Finally after 20 minutes of looking like complete (hungry) idiots, we simply got up and left and went elsewhere to eat. Oh and no one around us was getting served either, which was odd. What the hell was going on? Were we being punished? It was one of the most awkward experiences ever.

I may try the one in Mentor (MAY), but I'll never come back to this location. 

Service is half the battle and they were defeated. Like playing Civilization V on Deity defeated.
not much to say but amazing food and really nice people! everything is great,i always get the shrimp and onion rings and the chicken strips for the kids even those are great!
Our best local mall, from luxury to low-priced basics.  Many of the stores are new or recently remodeled, and almost all carry a broader selection than other valley locations.  My parking preference is the Nordstrom garage, though I have also found spaces in the Macy's garage.

Stores I regularly check out include Nordstrom, Macy's, 7 for all Mankind, Banana Republic, Crate & Barrel, and the tiny men's rack at Splendid (to see if it's on sale).  I'll swing by EXPRESS, Guess, Bath & Body Works, and a few other stores too depending on their sales. 

Fun to window shop at: Neiman Marcus, Tourneau, and Omega.  Unfortunately, snobby salespeople or intimidating store design make certain stores-to-ogle less inviting (David Yurman and Cartier, for example).  Oher stores are limited in their selection (Burberry), or are so small that you feel uncomfortable browsing and not buying (Montblanc is tinier than Omega, and doesn't have numerous window displays).  

If you want to be ignored and be alone in a museum-like setting, walk through Barneys.

They really need to fill the three empty Barneys wing anchor restaurant spaces though (Grand Lux, Modern Steak, and that Italian restaurant have all been gone for a while).  A few stores also dropped lines or shrunk their selections in the past few years thanks to the recession (Louis Vuitton lost their watches, Banana Republic replaced their Heritage selection with more petites, and Barneys lost a massive number of brands, including Dior Homme).  They're building a brand new gigantic Harkins movie theater and a Dick's Sporting Goods though.
Pretty good. I liked that I could sit with the large window open and enjoy the fresh air. 
I got a bagel and home fries, they were both good. I am from NJ so I am constantly searching for better bagels near Pitt. I would say this is probably my favorite spot to get a bagel that is walking distance from school.
Would recommend if you are looking for a cheap breakfast or brunch.
For a place called " The milkshake factory" I expected much more than a droopy completely liquified chocolate drink.  Thats all i have to say, for $4.50.
Tessio's Pizza is one of my favorites in the valley.  It is by no means gourmet, but it hits the spot every time.  They have a thin crust, decent sauce, and is always just greasy enough :)  Their sandwiches and sides are good as well.
By far one of the most horrible places I have ever lived! I am a traveling RN and the original appeal to Capri was the inexpensive short term lease options and small security deposits. The location of the apt and the pool area are also very nice. Walking distance to some neat places and safe neighborhood. That sums up the positives. 
There are a few staff members in the leasing office that are very rude. Not to mention their unprofessionalism but they are constantly out on the open patios smoking through out the day. If you call and no one answers, it is most likely because Patty and Selma are on a smoke break. 
We called about simple maintenance issues (backed up drain, AC not working well, exhaust fan problems, etc) and the little maintenance man simply said they were fine and walked out. We fixed the drain ourselves, but the other issues never got fixed. 
There is no covered parking unless you want to pay more or possibly park in the complete opposite end of your apt. 
So then there were the roaches...which I get that sometimes you get bugs when you live in an apt...you cant control what your dirty neighbors are doing. Capri sends a guy to spray and I ask if its safe for my dogs and he says probably. =0 The last straw was the 9 volt battery sized roaches we saw in the hallway frequently...or maybe the things getting stolen off our ground level patio...or the rotten musty urine smell of the grounds area...or the funny guy that would pull the fire alarm at 1am on a consistent basis. 
We lasted one month out of our 6 month lease. The leasing office was unwilling to work with us on subletting the apt and the fees to terminate a lease early were outrageous. However, they did agree to take off the pet fees once we explained that we weren't staying there anymore. Strangely though- no one ever asked why, which makes me think this may happen frequently? We have continued to pay the rent even though we don't live there, that's how bad it was. The only way this place would seem acceptable to me is if the rent was decreased by a few hundred\/month and you didn't mind living in filth.
Hi Windsor. Wink. I think I'd like to keep you. This place gets even more wonderful every single time. I've ventured into nearly all of the menu by now, and all of the items I want to try. When there's a lot of different things on the menu that interest my tummy, that's a good thing. Don't lose that part of you.

What's my favorite so far? Probably the fondue for an appetizer and the windsor burger (no tomato) and church potatoes for dinner. That seems to be the popular choice I make 80% of the time.

So.  What about the other 20%? BRUNCH BITCHES. Yes. There's brunch now as if this place couldn't get any better. Lovely, delicious, amazing brunch. Brunch with $5 pitchers of drinks. Brunches with some of the best biscuits I've ever had with my biscuits and gravy. Brunches that left the large group of people I came with amazed and full. 

The service is usually right on point. The food is always incredible. The decor I cannot seem to get enough of, and even though I am not a fan of having to valet, you make it complimentary. And the valet people are pretty cool. Is it sad that I'm nearly on a first name basis with them as well?

I beg you to stay, Windsor. And challenge you to deliver brunch to my house.
Amazing customer service Vicky was very helpful helped me choose some great kerestase products!
$5 cover gives you access to a wide variety of board\/card games, and a good beer selection @ $7 a pint, including a rotating tap with IPAs, porters and a decent enough selection to satisfy most beer lovers. It's a good venue for a chill night, or a start what could a crazier night. 

Service is a tad slow if you're sitting upstairs, but it's not really an environment where you're chugging your drinks (well, I suppose it could be... with all the games they offer. Just wait until the Asians find out about this place! Yes, I'm Asian, and I readily admit that although we have a low tolerance on average, we love our drinking games. If I were the marketing manager here actually....the possibilities are endless! sidenote: S&L owner, if you want some marketing tips, give me a shout!)  If you REALLY want to drink faster, well, just double your order when the server does come by. Problem solved. (and that's why my nickname is "problem solver". But you can call me PS).

I don't know what games they have to be honest, we were playing Cards Against Humanity all night. Some other table was playing "Sorry". And "sorry" I don't remember what other tables were playing, but I'm sure you can scroll through other reviews...

All in all, I enjoyed my night and I'd come back for the games and drinks - it's good for what it is, and different than other Toronto bars. 
The only reason it's not 5 stars is the food menu didn't look to good, though I have to admit I didn't try anything off the menu.
Imagine a male version of the iconic scene in "When Harry met Sally".

I just just gotten off a plane, jumped in my rental (look into Silvercar btw) and headed to Little Miss BBQ. Line outside was about 30 people deep at 12pm on a Wednesday. I didn't care, I wanted some brisket.

I'm from the southeast, so BBQ to me means pork. Getting good brisket can be difficult to find.  So once I heard they had good brisket, I had to come. The line took about 30 minutes, but they came out to make sure people grabbed waters (in the cooler beside the line) and offered up "samples" of their house-made sausage - I put sample in quotes because I ended up with like 3 pieces.

I got in and order 2 meat plate and went with lean brisket (they were out of fatty\/wet) and pork rib. Sides were grits and slaw.

That Brisket..... tender as a new mother holder her baby for the first time. My mouth made noises that made others around me look and wonder what was going on. Envision a male version of that scene in When Harry met Sally. It was that good.

Rib - Excellent, tender, flavorful. 
Slaw - felt I needed some sort of vegetables, but was too full to eat much of it. Good though
Grits - surprisingly tasty. Again I'm from the south, so I'm picky about my grits.

All-in-all I will likely eat here every chance I have when I am in town, and I would suggest others to as well. Just don't expect a quick lunch; and leave time for a nap after.
Anytime a service provider is assigned by your Home Warranty it is hard because you never know what you are going to get.  I set up my first appointment with Jennifer to get our Frigidaire Refrigerator repaired.  She was polite and professional and helped to find the first appointment she had where our refrigerator was down.  Our service man Eddie showed up right on time to evaluate the situation; unfortunately a new ice maker was needed.  So the Home Warranty had to be contacted to approve and get the parts ordered so there would need to be a second appointment.  

We were called as soon as they had a ETA for the part and we set up the appointment.  Eddie showed up right on time today and was very professional and worked to get the ice maker installed ASAP.  Unfortunately Frigidaire makes a product that when a ice maker blows it also shorts the computer board (which none of us knew) so Eddie has to order another part.  

The repair is taking some time but is not something HAS 24\/7 can control and unfortunately going through a Home Warranty slows down the process.  However everyone we have worked with during this painful process at HAS 24\/7 has been great and we have no complaints!!!
I liked this place. It's locally owned and very small. Tables are squeezed in. When we were there it was busy and we were not in a hurry. Okay. 

First we waited in line to order then we were told to sit down and someone will take our order. Okay. 

Then we were forgotten. Oops! 

I had to go back up to the counter to order. I was told to wait. Okay. Then she forgot me again. Finally she remembered me as I stood at the counter for another 10 mins (about 40 mins later) was not apologetic a bit brisk in fact. Okay. 

Then I showed her my check in offer from Yelp and her mouth formed into a small "o". 

After that, not surprisingly, service improved. Oops!  Too late!!!
One-Visiting from Austin,TX.  This might imply that I like my food on the spicy side so my review should be taken with a grain of salt.

Two-the online menu sounds fantastic. Reasonably priced,  and somewhat regionally sourced food.

Three-Which came first?  The chicken or the egg?  Or in relation to Keegan's, the geriatric clients who pay the bills and fill the restaurant OR the menu items which start out sounding so promising and end up being bland, bland, bland which caters to the existing clientele.  

I tried the fish and chips, with a beer sampler.  It's usually pretty hard to screw up.  The slaw consisted of fresh cut cabbage and other vegetables smothered in 99% mayo.  No sweetness of pickles or relish to counteract the creaminess of the mayo. The panko breaded fish was well prepared, but boring. Crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside, and tasteless.  Frozen fish sticks have more flavor.   My wife had the natural sourced burger, overcooked to medium well, served without mustard or mayo, not even on the side.  Both dishes came with fries, nicely cooked, but then over salted at the end.

Keegan's is a comfy, well staffed, restaurant serving safe standards cooked safely.  Your parents will love it.
Hostesses are very inefficient causing 50 min wait in line for breakfast at 9:30 a.m. Most items are extremely salty and the quality of food in general is subpar compare to other better known buffets in neighboring casinos. Not worth the wait and money. Drink plenty of water.
I live right across the street so I come in frequently! 
The portions are usually quite large so we split a entree and add an extra side salad. 
They have a little bit of everything on the menu, and most of it is great!
The last time we came we got a chicken pot pie and we actually find several small bones (which after two or three we couldn't eat anymore - who wants to anyways?) 
Other than the chicken pot pie everything was good! Breakfast is definitely my favorite!! 
They have an amazing selection for desserts! Cakes. Pie. Baklava. Everything. Sometimes we just come for the cheesecakes!! 
I will mostly stick to dessert and breakfast with the spot.
I came here 2 weeks ago with a friend and I was skeptical about the quality of the food.  The outside of the restaurant didn't look too appealing, and I knew the prices would be slightly higher than average.  I am glad my friend suggested this place to me though. We had a medium sushi platter between the two of us. The fish here was extremely fresh and fatty.  The fish felt like they melted in my mouth.  This place uses purple rice which essentially tastes the same, but it's nice to try something new. We ended up ordering the grilled BBQ chicken as well after we finished the platter because we were still hungry.  I was surprised that the chicken left me wanting more after my first bite!  The sauce was sweet, savory and also had a little kick of heat to it.  Overall the food was excellent and I've been wanting to go back ever since.

Now to go over the service here.  Our server was very friendly and quickly brought us water before we even asked.  While we were looking at our menu they came and gave us a few suggestions.  During the dinner, they brought us everything we asked for and was very attentive to our needs (ie. refill water\/tea).  I will definitely come back here in the future with more friends.
Wowwww pleins de bières en fût à 4$ :o On aime ça :) Belle place, l'ambiance est super sympa. L'hôtesse, qui est aussi propriétaire, qui nous a acceuilli était très aimable ainsi que les barmans. Attendez-vous à payer 25$ et plus pour bien manger :) J'ai mangé des frites et une guenille au homard...Super :) 

Je vous recommande cette place...!
Seeing as though the 4th is coming up we went fireworks shopping. Davey Jones is conveniently located off Carowinds Blvd. There were definitely a lot of fireworks crammed into a pretty small space. The lighting wasn't the best. The store was fairly busy and the aisles seemed a little small with so many people. I'm no fireworks expert but they seemed to have a decent selection. Note: They have an $8 minimum on credit transactions. Annoying if you don't carry cash and have a small purchase.

As we were driving away, we decided to stop in across I-77 at the Red Rocket Fireworks store. They had an item I bought over at Davey Jones Fireworks for HALF the price! Supposedly, Davey Jones has a lowest price guarantee... From their website: "we beat any price or it's free!" Well, I called about it and it doesn't really work like that... On the phone they said that I would have to come back in with the item and they would call the other store to investigate. Then they would refund the difference between prices. It isn't really worth the hassle for a few bucks (which is probably what they count on). Oh, and they don't offer any bonus\/free items with purchase like Red Rocket did.
Restaurant Chez Parra is a great little French restaurant in Longueuil, Quebec, which is a suburb of Montreal on the South Shore, just across the waters form that thriving international city.

It is long and narrow, with a Salon Prive (private room) in the rear, which our party of 6 occupied, amidst original art decorating the walls. The ambiance is simple, understated, casual elegance and cozy. 

The menu has traditional French specialities, such as Foie Gras for appetizer, and mains like Duck l'Orange, Veal, and even Rabbit. There are a few other mediterranean infuences like Canelloni and Carpaccio from Italy and  Paella from Spain, and they have several seafood selections like more than one salmon and a trout dish, as well as other popular meat favorites.

They have a very affordable 3 course daily  evening special, with appetizer, main and dessert for under $24 CAD (under $20 USD at today's exchange) and most of the entrees a la carte are $18 - $24 CAD,with appetizers in the $6 - $10 CAD range.  They have an adequate wine selection appropriate for their food offerings. 

Service is very attentive, with the owner\/manager  providing personalized suggestions and service. 

This is mostly a hidden, affordable gem for locals, but if you are ever in Longueuil or along the south shore of Montreal, this would be an excellent, affordable choice for good local French food.
One of my frequent stops when I want a sub. I like how they slice the meat and cheese fresh to order. I usually order the turkey and pastrami when I go here. They make pretty good subs, as far as sub shops go.

The staff is very friendly at this location. They also have an iPhone app to order ahead of time so you won't have to wait in line to order.

I would recommend you try this place.
Went here on my day off. Its a great place to eat breakfast at. There was no wait for our table and the service was really good too. Our meals were good and filling. I had the usual omelet which was great. The restaurant itself was designed really nicely.
Another Liberty Village lunch staple. Cute decoration (love their glass), dimly lit place, nice open patio to eat outside. Suffering the same problem as their Japanese cuisine neighbour 'InJapan' in that their food is highly forgettable. I would've given this place a 3.5 though just because their glass noodles has some flavour and chicken cutlet is a little bigger. Also purple rice.

On Ritual.
Now that we've moved this has been the go to place for the late night specials. Great happy hour at the steakhouse, movie theater, bowling and soon a concert theater. 

So far an all around good place to go for whatever you're in the mood for. With kids or without?
Abridged: 
Just go. Every bad review you've read has been wrong.

Unabridged:
I was worried. Afraid. Scared of heading to Big Earl's after the reviews I read that it just wasn't up to par. I'm so glad didn't listen and went anyway.

I guess I'm glad I walked in the side entrance because I didn't see the big display of tshirts Martin mentioned in his New Times review. Or they just aren't as out there. Or I was just really craving food. Either way, now that I'm thinking of Martin, I wonder if he knows he's on a big framed banned poster hanging up at Big Earl's.

The place could benefit from some decor change, but I honestly think it's still that way for the mere fact that it's in old town. I bet those business buildings have HOAs. Tuscan\/crap\/southwestern style or die....

But. I digress...

Usually when I see lunch menu options at a BBQ place I tend to want to skip them b\/c I think they're going to be ruined 'by the bun" and just a small icky amount of what I want to enjoy. Looking at the prices and sizes of the lunch and dinner menu though, I could tell Big Earl's was some serious shit. Serious. It was hard to make a choice. They have desserts with chocolate whip people... chocolate whip. I almost avoided real lunch food altogether. They have a leg of beast feast... folks.. if you got this for carry out, I'm not sure how it would fit in your car. But I can guarantee you'd eat it all. 

So what did I get?

The Kentucky Mule is bourbon and ginger beer. And it was perfect. 

I was the only one in my group to ever have fried pickles before, and I was curious as to if they were as bad as mentioned before, so I ordered them. They were PERFECT. I have yet to see fried pickles done as well in this area as they are at Earl's. I have turned several people into fried pickle enthusiasts!!

Then I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and mac & cheese. And I was full. This was the largest lunch I've ever seen. The bun at first looks like a cheap attempt at a bun, but it compliments the pork perfectly. Their sweet & spicy sauce is my favorite and the mac & cheese was to die for.

As we finished, Tony, who cooks and created the sauces, came over to our table to give us a chance to let him know what he can fix. One of my table guests sarcastically complained about the mac & cheese he devoured. The result? We were brought out another side of deep fried mac & cheese. HOLY HELL!! 

This place is amazing. The food is stellar. Drinks are great. Prices are very reasonable for the quantity and quality and I would come back again in a heartbeat. Have I convinced a gaggle of you to come with for the leg of beast feast??? I don't want to eat it myself, but I have to admit, I'm hella curious.
I normally hate giving 3 star "middle of the road" reviews but Blue Martini was completely average. It is HUGE and has a great atmosphere but the food and drinks were just okay and we had to practically beg for service. Our waitress must have apologized to us 5 times throughout our 3 happy hour appetizers and 2 rounds of martinis. They seemed completely understaffed...

I did like the fact that my Nevada resident female friend received a free drink with her valid ID.

Again, 3 stars.
Everything from the decor to the staff and of course the food is on point at Wilbur. 

Colleague and I went in for lunch last week, we arrived at noon and seemed to just miss the rush (by 12:30 there was a lineup to order). We were greeted at the door by a really nice guy who asked if we had been to the restaurant before, we said no, and he walked us through the menu and ordering system. You order at the front counter, get a number and sit anywhere. 

Our food was brought to us within 5min! We split the guacamole and queso and each had 2 tacos as well. The guacamole was so fresh, to my taste it could have been a bit spicier but the queso offset that as it had some nice heat to it. I thoroughly enjoyed both. It's worth noting you do get a nice handful of chips with the tacos so we ended up with quite a lot of chips - very filling! For my tacos I had the bulgogi beef (with sriracha cream, pear, cabbage, and sesame seeds), and the pork (with pickled red onion, jalapeno-cilantro crema, and cotija cheese). 

The meats were so delicious and well cooked and the toppings really complimented the whole thing. Neither had any real heat to them but that is preferable in a place where the salsa and hot sauce selections are endless. I gave the ghost pepper salsa a try - do not fear it is tolerable but definitely hot, and the salsa verde was another fave. 

Throughout our visit we were checked on twice by a very helpful employee. I think this place will be around for awhile, and I'll be back very soon! Excited to try those brisket taquitos!
Just wanna update and say we love our sever Aaron he's the best!! Always on top of everything give this man a raise!! And out favorite sushi chefs Kevin & Nick!!! The three of them alone make this place awesome..lol and the sushi is good too
I don't know who Honey Bun is but I love their buns and boba! They now accept credit cards with purchases $10 or over. I highly recommend the Spicy Kimchi Bun and any boba milk tea or smoothie.
I go here all the time because:

1. It's always busy, that means food is good.

2. The bean sprouts and basil in the side are always fresh. The ingredients are fresh. Order something beside pho and taste the fresh ingredients. They don't have to put too much seasoning. "FRESH!"

3. They have the pickled jalapeño jar. I'm Thai, we Thais need something other than siracha. I only wish they had fresh ground chili. 

4. Service is simple, they just take order and you get up and pay at counter, I like that. So the food is not expensive and one does not need to leave a huge tip. 

I love this place. I seriously do. I just wish they had sandwiches too. Then my life would be complete.
sda jio;das m,\/ewa ijo'dsankfds[pw ...Oh dear. It looks like my fingers are too fat now to type. I am instead typing this laboriously using a paintbrush held between my teeth. I also fill my entire sofa, and hang over the sides. But if you seize the folds of my face and lift them to seek out the features underneath, you will see something that looks like a radiant beatific smile. Friends, I tried Burger.

I tried a chicken katsu burger with pickles in a soft glazed brioche bun with added cheese and bacon. I tried a bag of delicious fluffy skin-on fries. I tried a chocolate milkshake with raspberries, a milkshake so thick that I had to suck harder than a Dyson to get that stuff up the straw. I tried to find the words to describe my joy, and I found only sweet, viscose tears creeping down the creamy rolls of my cheek.

It might not be Michelin star, but I am a Michelin Man, and I am so very, very happy.
I would absolutely 1000% recommend Prenatal Premiere for an ultrasound! I went for a 3D\/4D ultrasound at 33 weeks and loved that they had Sunday appointments! I was able to invite my family to attend, as they have comfortable couches and a huge screen (think theatre style). Seating is enough for 10, I had 8. Service here was excellent, our technician was really nice and very informative\/thorough. We received some beautiful photos and her heartbeat in a stuffed animal. My family and I had a wonderful experience and I would definitely recommend coming here!
When I first walked into Hanny's, I loved the vibe. I loved the feel of the interior space. I also loved the hip, trendy feel. And at initial glance, the food and drink menus looked delish. The kind of place I could come and become a regular costumer. 
But . . . you can have all these elements and still make your costumer pause and think . . . Hmmm, there are so many restaurants in Phoenix . . . I want my regular place to be a happy place.
Sooo even though Hanny's soooo cool in so many ways, this place is not a keeper for me.
Great craft beers.  Try the havartti  and ham sandwich, it's awesome!
Hostess is not 'on' it. Waited 5 min before she even acknowledged me. Other than that, seems like a good place to hang.  The food was a bit mediocre.  Nellos is better.
I had my wedding reception here after a few visits on my own and then a few tastings. Used the back private room, had several dishes to offer...a really wonderful experience with outstanding food and service...

It a foodies delight.
Novotel is a Eurocentric chain of business hotels that is part of the European Accor Hotel family of brands, which include Ibis Hotels, and perhaps its most prolific US chain, Motel 6. 

I used to stay regularly in the Novotel Hotel in Glenn Waverly in the southeast suburbs of Melbourne, Australia, and it was efficient, moderately priced, and well run.

This Novotel is similar and is located very close to the P.E.T. Montreal Airport, off highway 40 near highway 13. 

It is a 5 story hotel, pretty new with no signs of wear and tear, with modern Euro styled furnishings. The room is decent size, with a king size bed with a sheet and duvee-covered down comforter, and 3 king size pillows. The bathroom is also modern  Euro like with the more table like wash basin stand, a faux porcelain basin "bowl", with nice european fixtures. 

I always wondered why French and Japanese hotels have better bathroom fixtures, more stylish and functional, with faucets in sinks and bathtubs with smooth pouring streams of water, while American hotels have these funky rubber gasketed faucets that splatter about with the refinement of a fat ,spitting American tourist wondering why everyone in a foreign country doesn't speak English? 

This hotel is for business people, as there is no bathtub, only a nice tiled  large shower with adjustable slide\/handheld shower head. 

The Novotel has a free airport shuttle van, a small restaurant with a buffet breakfast that only costs $9 CAD, and has a clean modern feel and ambiance. We only paid $99 CAD for a Friday night in spring.
Like-minded burger & shake people rejoice! Shakes & burgers are a combination of attributes no person whom is not Vegan can resist. 
Here at Holsteins you will find the finest spiked milkshake In Vegas.  You will find a line-up of shakes spiked or non-spiked (spiked as in with alcohol). Whichever you milkshake you may choose these are a meal in themselves. 
Come thirsty & come hungry. Why? Riddle me this, how can one not order a shake AND one of the burgers...along with a side.  burgers are always consistently cooked just as I ordered. Not undercooked, nor over cooked.  No frozen hamburger buns here, no frozen fries here!  Vegans, they do have a 'burger' patty for you, with black beans and a variety of veggies:)
Go ahead. Do it. Just do it.  Regret it later when you feel the need for a nap. Food coma anyone? ;)
What can I say for the numero UNO kingpin pizza in the world. They also deliver pizza and you always know  what you're getting.
***** 5 Stars

I noticed this place when I was walking out of Veggie Nation. It is right next door. I walked in to ask how much they charge to line up my beard. $18 for a shave is a pretty good price. I gave them a try. Jordan did a great job. It's a cool little shop and everyone there is very friendly. Come check this place out. It is worth the drive downtown.
Great location, very open\/bright layout but prices on produce aren't competitive with Woodman's. They have a great selection and huge variety but I don't see myself coming back here unless I'm in that part of town and in dire need of something.

They do stock some unique fruits that aren't available elsewhere (ie dragonfruit, persimmon, etc).
This place is between Sunset and the 215 in an office complex just East of Durango. I entered the complex from Sunset and drove all of the way back towards the 215 to get there. It is a nice little French Cafe that has patio seating available. The guy at the register was very friendly and he had the French accent to go alone with the French themed cafe. The dining area looked nice and clean and so did the service area.

They use Illy coffee her, it's one of my favorite automatic drip coffees. It also is good to use in a French press. We ordered the 20oz cups. We ordered the Vegan Pesto Eggplant and the Moroccan Eggplant sandwiches. Both sandwiches were served on baguettes and were very good. We also tried the chocolate twist. It was basically a chocolate croissant. That was very good, especially with the coffee. The berry tarts looked amazing, but they will have to wait until next time.

I will definitely be back to try some more items on the menu. I would recommend you give this place a try.
This is Venezuelan soul food in my opinion because it's definitely made with love. Yum! Great ambiance and really up beat attitudes on the service end as well. I've been hearing people rave about this place so I finally gave it a shot. The yucca root fries are bomb with the creamy green sauce. Their shredded beef in definitely a winner and I love the combinations of black beans and meat, I'm a huge bean addict. . . I crave protein like no other and this place can give you a great protein filled gluten free meal or a vegetarian|vegan one at that! (something ridiculously hard to find in fast casual dining for whatever reason) No. . . I don't want to go out to eat and have a salad. Proteins + Good carbs here! I don't have celiacs but this place is definitely celiacs friendly! Craving a hearty meal. . .these arepas really do the trick! It can be a naughty or a nice meal and I love the option! Must try!
Not impressed :(
Knew some folks that used molyneaux without any issues, so we decided to try them. Salesman assured us their installers were A+
After the installation, I found númerous issues - service rep came out to review and made some repairs to installation.  Said he was going to talk to management about issue - never heard from anyone.  A few months later noticed another issue and called service.  Reviewed complaints with the service rep and he agreed the install was not up to their standards - one of the main issues is that the steps weren't properly cut and the carpet did not fit flush.  This time someone did call me back and offered to replace the stairs but could not guarantee color match, so he was to "talk to someone" to see about refunding us some money.  Finally after about two weeks we received a call offering us $150.  I had asked if that was the cost of a new install for the stairs and he replied no but that was all owners were willing to compensate us.  Soooo, we have decided to live the the imperfections and learn not to ever use molyneaux again.  We have since replaced the remaining carpet in the house and used a truly reputable place and this time received A+ work.  
If you don't mind "C-" work then by all means use them
Seriously.. how have I missed this place for months??? Well I found it this week, and it's almost my new Loveland. Most of the clothes so far haven't been up my alley, but the accessories are ON POINT. For real. I walked out with two headbands yesterday and was in love. Wanted about a dozen more. 

The owner? Super nice. She let us know what was in the store, how it was laid out, sales going on, and was very helpful. The dog Blueberry is about as adorable and friendly as they get and was very good at helping me find just what I was looking for. 

As with most boutique shops, the prices vary due to different designers, and while some of them are steep, overall it's not bad at all. I will more than likely return on several occasions.

If you need help finding it, look for Melrose Pharmacy and the big blue bow beside it :)
I recently moved to the area and have been on the hunt for a good bagel shop\/bakery. I have been here twice now and haven't been impressed either time. The first time I went inside, which was nice. I ordered the cinnamon bagel with honey walnut cream cheese. I must say, that cream cheese is divine!! The blueberry muffin was a joke...really greasy and not tasty. I came here again for breakfast and went to the drive thru, which was really fast and efficient. I just kept it simple with a plain bagel and plain cream cheese and didn't have any complaints. All in all, this place is OK but nothing special. I really wish they had more bakery items to choose from since their restaurant has the word "bakery" in it.
Stacy is the BEST chiropractor in the valley!! She works on mommas and babies as well as everyone else. Her office is friendly and centrally located. I refer ALL of my doula clients and midwifery clients to her for care before, during and after pregnancy. I see her on a regular basis as well. Chiropractic care is paramount for better health. What are you waiting for? Call and go in and see Stacy!!
Cool place!  From the outside, it doesn't look like much, but once you get inside, it's fantastic.  I literally could not stop staring at the sparkly night-sky screen they have on the ceiling.  The whole place is Hawaiian \/ Caribbean themed, right down to the shrunken heads and fountains along the walls.  The drinks are yummy, and the bartenders are super nice.  It gets busy and loud, but that's to be expected with a venue like this.  There's a big clam shell that's also great for taking pictures.  All around, one of the most fun bars I've ever been to.
Got my iPhone repaired here. They were quick and helpful. I would refer everyone here.
Was at Resident Culture this past weekend, and this was one of the food trucks they had here. I was eying the bahn mi, but they ran out before I was hungry - bummer, but it was a daily special and it must have been delicious! I ordered the buffalo chix quesadilla meal (Cajun fries). When I ordered the gentleman told me it would take about five minutes. In that time we decided to find a table (which took longer than expected because the brewery was crazy busy!). I went back for my food and it was ready and waiting for me. The Cajun fries were amazing!! I do not like crispy fries and they were definitely perfect for me! The quesadillas had cheese, chicken, spinach and tomatoes. The ingredients were not evenly spread out and I felt like there were globs of just spinach in some bites. But the overall flavor was pretty good, and definitely a good size portion!
Lone Mountain is a nice little hike. It is not difficult if you use the trail on the West side of the mountain. It is still a good work out. The footing is fairly stable most of the way up so you can run up the trail if you so desire. The East side of the mountain is a climb. There is no trail. I only did it because the first time I went there I did not bother to look around the other side for a trail.
Private theater w six screens right in the midst of ASU college town. Cool venue. This is where you can come to get your Rocky Horror fix.  Also rent out theater for musical and theatre perfomances.
Great food and service. The Hawaiian ribeye is worth the price. And the steak salad was just perfect- I can still taste the perfect balance of flavors. Yummmm! Will definitely return!!
So we were looking on yelp for some place new to order from and decided to try Those Guys Pies.

We ordered the Maui Wowie Pizza, an Original Cheesteak sandwich a order of wings and a 2 liter bottle of soda. The total was just over $40.00

The guy who took the order over the phone was friendly, the delivery guy was friendly. The food arrived in about 30 minutes.

As far as the food goes, for the price,  I was hoping it would be tastier than it was.

The wings and sandwich were pretty good. I wasn't as impressed with the pizza. 

It wasn't bad, but I really wasn't overly impressed. I'll probably try it again at some point in the future.
Worst customer service experience in my life. Stood in line for ten minutes while the cashier chatted up some girls, so I thought we'd sit at the bar and order since no one was sitting there and the guy behind the bar was standing there doing nothing. He sees us leave the line and sit down, he turns around and starts wiping the bar. I wait for five minutes and finally ask him if we can order some coffee. He turns around and says "get in line". I told him we were already in the line and now there's ten more people behind the two girls who are still talking to the cashier. He says "not my problem". Smarmy a**hole. I left and will never step inside that place again.
This was my husband's and myself first time here. Im telling you now we shall return the wait wasnt bad at all. Now the food, first the bread I'm not a big bread eater but let's just say I kept ordering more. The food i had the Stuffed Tilapia with fresh season vegetables and a side of Truffle Macaroni and Cheese, my husband had the special which was the Salmon with Blue Cheese and Sauted Spinach Im once again not a salmon person I love seafood but not all,and his salmon looked so good. He enjoyed every bite. The price wasnt bad at all for the 2 of us , we walked out saying WE'LL BE BACK.
A very nice hotel, with the best service in Las Vegas.  If you looking for a upscale, quiet hotel this is the place.  Once inside the Four Seasons you forget your in Vegas, but when you are wanting the Casio vibe, than a short walk to to the connected Mandalay Bay is available.  The pools, the restaurants (Charlie Palmer and the Veranda) both great places.  Pool side seating is available at the Veranda.  All in all a great place, unless your wanting the Casino vibe.
Malgré la mauvaise impression que j'avais eu il y a des années de ce cinéma, je me suis décider d'y aller car il est proche de mon travail. OHHH Malheur....on arrive là...et la caissière.....comment dire...je crois qu'elle détestait sa job où était simplement hyper bête. Malgré toutes les lumières...la moquette des années 80 pour nous impressionner en allant à notre salle....je n'ai pas été renversé par la déco....mais bon sa reste un cinéma....
En 2017...je ne peux pas croire qu'on soit obligé de payer CASH dans un cinéma...en tout cas...

Rendu à la salle...les bancs ARKKEE....vieillissant...inconfortable tsé ils se sont dit qu'un bancs rembourré avec un angle de 90° ça allait être confo pour tout le monde. Watch out la dernière rangée où plusieurs tâches de substance blanche sont visible.... il sont sale en plus de miettes. Peut être qu'ils avaient ramassé les cochonneries laissé par les autres clients mais il y avait encore ben du pop corn à terre. Le 3D m'a donné mal à la tête et l'image n'est pas top clean comparativement à une autre grande chaîne de cinéma qu'on retrouve à Mtl...

Mon étoile va au parking intérieur gratuit...et au fait que Star Wars Rogue One était ben bon
Hands down this place has the best vegetable lasagna and eggplant parmesan. The prices are cheap and the food is plentiful. When I need a carb hangover this is where I go.
Great service and quiet little spot that is perfect for a dinner where you plan to sit for some time and chat away. Food here is fresh, delicious and the menu is simple which is perfect!
Great prices, homemade food.  I am happy with my experiences at Taco Loco
J'aime ce petit resto douteux sur le Boul. Pie-Ix . La nourriture est bonne et les serveurs sont toujours en train de vous surveiller pour ne rien manquer. Ils ont un vaste menu et le midi c'est très très cheap! Typique resto chinois avec des nappes blanches en plastique haha!
I think the food is OK, but overpriced. I also think Grimaldi's is over rated. When a friend wants to go I will go, but I don't say let's go...
Hongfantian ( nom en mandarin)


Cuisine séchuannaise par excellence!

Service fort efficace, le garcon m'indiqua que mes choix, compe tenu que j'étais seul,  ne conviennaient pas car trop généreuxsi je ne pouvait en rapporter l'excédent.

J'ai donc opté pour:

Soupe aigre- douce
Salade froide de méduse ( méduse, concombres, coriande et huile de sésame
Boeufsauté  et piment fort
Riz blanc

Accompagné d'une bière Tsingtao

L'endroit était bondé de clients asiatiques. Les quelques cIients\/clientes nord- américains étaient accompagnés par des connaissances asiatiques.

L'endroit est très propre, bien éclairé et l'ambiance fort agréable.

Les plats furent à la hauteur de mes attentes, fort savoureux et servis chauds à l'exception de la salade froide de méduse, fort naturellement.

Endroit à retrouver  en groupe!
We recently attended the St. Francis Festival here and had our dog blessed. While we didn't get to see the inside of the center, it seemed to be a lovely location and the grounds were certainly clean and well kept. This was a great event with animal adoptions and dogs everywhere! Lots of fun for our dog (and us) and we will certainly return next year.
It's target, but only SUPER! 

Pretty much has everything every other target has but more, including groceries! I realize that some targets don't always have the same things due to size and all that but this one has enough space to pretty much carry everything they offer in store. Even has a snack shop AND a Starbucks.
Expect to wait but the food is worth it. Fresh and local with nice portions. Bacon is thick and delicious and coffee was really good too. I got the breakfast sandwich and the entire thing just about melted in my mouth - the bread was super fresh. Their homemade jams are simply delightful. Will definitely come back.
After my favorite car wash closed down, I was in desperate need of a new spot to keep my whip all sparkly and clean. I came here before and wasn't super impressed but decided to give it another shot because of it's convenient location. I am glad I did because it is now my go-to.


Although the wash itself isn't the most spectacular, I decided to go with the unlimited car wash option, which is around $15\/month. You can go through as many times as you'd like, even in a day. Each time you go through they give you an air freshener (tropical is the best) and wet microfiber terry cloth. AND you can utilize the free vacuums. To me, this is a really good deal. When you purchase a monthly pass, you get a free trial month and you can cancel at any time. You also get a scanner so you get to avoid having to deal with the kiosk, which makes it super easy to go through. All of the employees I've encountered are helpful and friendly. 

I am happy with my new car wash and love that it is so convenient and affordable. Gotta stay clean out here in this AZ sun!
An employee by the name of Eric treats clients like dirt. His customer service skills are terrible. I am visiting from California to attend a graduation, we just came back from dining at Mastros and we we're greeted with a condescending attitude. Eric made us feel like we we're prison inmates. He yelled at us when we asked for a drink at the bar because they don't serve drinks after 12 which of course we didn't know that. This is a terrible experience. All he had to do was inform us like a normal person would. ERIC is very rude and needs to be addressed otherwise Hyatt will lose customers. We are never staying here again.
Great professional friendly service.  Lots of current styles to choose from, and I was able to get an eye exam on the same day. 5 out of 5 stars!  Thanks Owl!
Awesome show!!! Lights and sounds were great! Really enjoyed it. It was funny also. Def recommend it!!
Meh...I went here for the Lakers game today.  They have appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, ribs, and salads.  The O'Connell burger that I ordered, which had bacon was just so-so.  The fries were decent.  The Coors Light was a little flat.  Overall, just an average sports bar.  The crowd here seemed a little older.
We've been here several times since they opened a year or two ago. The service is okay, but I agree with others that their food needs a lot of work and their beer selection is limited. The issue I have with PJ's is that they have a real good game on the outside - their bands, their decor, their service, but their drinks and food just don't deliver.

For instance, "Sassy Chicks" isn't a menu item I would want to eat anywhere, although it's PJ's ridiculous name for one of my favorite (usually)  menu items (chicken fingers) in other restaurants. Don't get me started on the similarly unappetizing and stupidly named "Barney Stone Sliders" or "Flapping Arms". I sincerely don't know how the wait staff refer to these menu items without sneering, scoffing or otherwise looking put out, and I sincerely don't know what the owners were thinking when they put together a menu with such outrageously hideous names. I don't want to sound like I'm at some stupid themed restaurant when I order food, and when I go to PJ's I end up trying to convey to the waiter what I want without using their unbelievably sophomoric names for the items. Seriously, PJ's owners, how hard would it be to refer to chicken wings as "chicken wings" and not as "flapping arms"... is that too simple and straightforward for you all to consider? Do you really think you're adding value with stupid names?

Second, for an Irish place, they simply don't highlight classic Irish food at all. For instance, there's another very successful Irish bar\/restaurant in Charlotte (which shall remain anonymous) with a menu that offers Shepherd's pie, Irish potato cakes, potato and leek soup, and soda bread. PJ's offers none of these, although they have ridiculous names for imitation items like "PJ's Pie", "Loaded Spud Soup" or "Onion Soup" and God help us all, "O'Fries".

I hate gimmicks and PJ's is relying on cheap gimmicks for their menu, the food from which is served on cheap black plates and looks like fast food when it arrives at the table.

While PJ's is an okay place to stop in for a quick beer, I'm disappointed by it greatly, overall. Mostly because I feel the owners have a real opportunity to showcase Irish food and Irish bar food in south Charlotte and they've totally squandered that opportunity in favor of gimmicks. I sincerely hope that PJ's someday becomes the Irish bar my husband and I dreamed of walking to several times a week before it opened. Because we discovered after it opened that it's really just a cheap imitation "Irish Disneyland" wannabe that isn't really worth visiting.
I recently went through their drive through for lunch.

This was the first drive through I've ever been through that splits into two lanes to order then back into one lane to pay.

I don't know if this actually makes things faster or not as it wasn't busy when I was there. The speed of service seemed about average. 

The employees had pleasant personalities and the food was about average for McDonald's.
Chris, owner and laborer of Immaculate Auto Detailing, was the lucky man to scrub 4 years worth of filth out of my car. The business is appropriately named, as my car left his shop in a state of immaculate cleanliness, with absolutely no details overlooked. I was really amazed with the results. It looks like new!!! 

Chris gave us a ride to the mall while we waited for him to work his magic, which was a nice gesture. He was a super nice guy. We were able to laugh comfortably about the forgotten porn in my trunk and used condoms under the seats. There's no need to be embarrassed about your habits with Chris, he's seen it all and he does not make judgements - he just does a really fucking great job, and he takes pride in his work. He had another job waiting, but instead of rushing us out, he made friendly conversation and helped us with directions to our next destination. 

When I called to make my appointment, he was pretty well booked up, so I ended up with an appointment about a month after the call. It was worth the wait.
Cafe Castel is an awesome spot! Be it for a quick coffee to go, a catch up with an old friend or a solo coffee + study session. 

They make the best cappuccinos and the adorable drawings they make on them are a life saver. If you're looking for a snack - their lemon poppy seed cake is a safe bet and always perfectly lemony, moist and satisfying. 

Their sandwiches are on the pricier side but are consistent, delicious and the ingredients are fresh. 

The staff is wonderful and the cafe is charming. The only downside is the outlets can be tricky to acquire - but alas not everything can be perfect!
As far as bowling alleys go, it's a pretty average looking place. They do have a pretty cool cafe with pool tables and TV's as well as a snack bar. What I do like about this place is it's clean and staff are very friendly. I come here for my boyfriend's bowling league and find it comfortable to hang out.I also do enjoy the fact there's no smoking inside. If you're looking for a good place to bowl, I'd go here!
Freshly made mozzarella cheese I've got today was so awesome! I just came to get pasta (bucatini is my fav), capers and tomato sauce (NINA is so tasty and thick), but ended up getting mozzarella, pinwheels (best that I've ever tasted), and 1LB of salami. The guy always offer me to taste something yummy which I always end up buying, and he usually gives me a good discount. Love this place!!! I live near summerlin but it's worth the drive :)
When Marisa S. asked me if I wanted to join her for a wine tasting here at first I thought it would be a place like Bevmo or Total Wine based on their name Wine WAREHOUSE. 
Much to my surprise and pleasure, it's a boutique wine shop with friendly staff. For more details on what's offered read some of the other reviews already posted. 
I will write the ambience is great- perfect place to bring a date or come with a group of friends. Great location with a beautiful patio out front with seating. 
Friendly and knowledgeable staff- sure to become a neighborhood favorite!
I am a limo driver in LV and when I bring people to the dam I usually recommend this place because the food is good. I'm getting tired however of my people complaining that it takes over an hour to get sandwiches. This isn't the first time this has happened either. Hire some more people because your about to start losing business, starting with mine and I drive a limo that holds 30. I brought 11 today. Your welcome. I'm sure your slow service will affect my tip though.
Great places for a quick and tasty lunch!  I came here after seeing my collegues always getting great looking sandwiches from this restaurant. I ordered the smoked salmon wrap and it was out of this world! The wrap had fresh ingredients and a generous portion of smoked salmon and brie cheese (my fav!).  The wrap also came with a soup or salad.  I went with their daily soup and it flavourful to say the least.  The restaurant gets really busy during lunch so I think it's better to come slightly before 12 or after 12:30 to skip the line.  I will definitely come back here the next time I forget to bring a lunch.
Meh sums it up pretty well. Went for $2 Tuesday, where every taco, mini margaritas, and Coronitas are $2. The space is really neat. It's well decorated and open. The patio is pretty awesome too. The food was very disappointing. The queso (added chorizo) was watery and bland. I ordered an assortment of tacos and couldn't find any that were actually palatable. The Ahi Tuna Taco was actually bad... Like fishy fish bad. The best thing on the table were the chips. I will be returning to enjoy drinks and munch on the free chips, but I won't be consuming any food until they fix the quality.
I went here today for the first time with a friend and I really enjoyed the "betty boop". It came with one big waffle and a chicken thigh. The waffle was good, tasted like cinnamon, and the chicken was juicy and delicious! I also ordered a rasberry kool-aid just because it was available and I enjoyed that as well! I loved how quick we got the food and how attentive the servers were, even the host was great! 

I would come back for the chicken and waffles but also to try their "soul food".
The Hotel Nelligan is right in the heart of Old Montreal, with old world charm and service. The 6 story building is brick with a nice facade, and the interior has been remodeled with washed brick and wood accents. The rooms are decent sized and furnished handsomely with understated luxury. There is a small bar and dining, and most room rates come with breakfast included. 

You'll pay about $175 to $250 depending on room and season. You can step outside and walk the quaint narrow streets with their shops, bistros and drinking establishments.
The past two times I've been here I've been served cold, soggy tater tots.  Today my Zeus turkey burger was extremely salty, which did not make it very tasty (and I usually like very salty food, but this was obviously over-seasoned ).  

I like that they offer a decent selection of food for decent prices, but when Sonic out-performs you on food quality (note: different from ingredient quality), something is going wrong in the kitchen.

I stoppedby Royal Meats (an out of the way location, for me at least) to try the alleged "best burgers in town" as recommended by my friend Jeff M.  I had the 1\/2 pound royal burger.

I'm a fan of cooking burgers on a flat top, rather than a grill, so that you get that nice crust on the burger... but that's just me.  The beef was moist, but the bread was plain.  The best thing about the burger was the toppings... they have this roasted red pepper sauce that is awesome.  If you go here, definitely get the roasted red pepper spread on your burger, and some on the side too :)  I'd come back for the roasted red pepper spread alone, if I'm in the area. 

The price point is a bit high for what you get imo, considering your in etobicoke.  Also, be prepared to wait. I came after the gym and I was starving, so having to wait 20-25 minutes for my burger did not make me too happy. 

All in all, my friend is wrong; it's not the best burger in town. IMHO, that award still goes to Burger's Priest.  But, it's a decent burger with great toppings which you won't be unhappy with.
We went for dinner for my wife's birthday. We we're given a sizable gift card (otherwise we would have broke the bank). From what I understand, Fleming's is a chain, and it certainly felt that way given our wait time between drinks. The steak and salmon were both incredible and the price reflected the quality of the meat. Still, was looking for something a bit more singular for the money.
For just a $2.00 entrance fee you can't beat this place. Very interesting and informative. I haven't been out here in years but today my girlfriend and I spent an enjoyable morning checking it out.

My only piece of constructive criticism would be that some of the outdoor displays in the ghost town need to be redone. They have become weathered and are often times hard to read.
Oliver now has weekend hours!  One of the friendliest places in the area!  Finally weekend hours;)  The chocolate twist is a must, as the fruit tarts. On your return trips here, which you will be back- always try a different pastry!
Came here last night and had a good time. The service was great. The menu has a lot of really cool burgers to choose from. I had the bad ass burger which had fried buttermilk bacon (pray for arteries) lol. It was really good. The bacon cheese burger on steroids is really good too. Overall I really enjoyed the place and food. It's in a perfect location where you can grab a bite to eat then walk over to catch a movie at the nearby theater.
Cheap, delicious, quick sushi. Can't go wrong. Has a great atmosphere and the service is always awesome! Highly recommend this place for some good sushi in Oakland.
Sonic has ok food for a drive-in.  They do have tater tots which I love.  They also offer them topped with chili and cheese.  On this trip I ordered the popcorn chicken with chili-cheese tots.  If you are in a hurry or just need a quick lunch this is an ok place.

The one noteable downside is that it is not a good place to meet people for lunch.  They offer outside seating, but that is not a fun thing in Las Vegas in the summer.  As long as you are in the same vehicle there are no issues.
A really unique spot to have in Pittsburgh. Think the Spanish version of Cure. Great variety in terms of cured meats and a great place to go share plates. The restaurant does get extremely loud, service was fantastic -the food was good to very good. Tried the ox tail-like a short rib French onion soup sandwich(best Dish i had). The beef tartar was an extremely fresh and light take on the dish which was really nice. The chorizo was fantastic and the ribs were fall off the bone and not to filling. I would give this a 4.5 if I could but I think the restaurant lacks a signature dish and if I would say cure is a 5 it's tough to give their sister restaurant the same rating but it is close.
Jolly Bob's is a good time. It's consistently a good time. Maybe it's the strong tropical drinks? 

It's often very crowded, but there is a great patio in back! On nights when there is live music, everyone gets their dance on. It's usually some sort of reggae which adds to the tropical experience. 

In addition to trying pretty much any one of the tasty tropical cocktails, I recommend the chicken appetizer that comes with the peanut sauce. It's amazing.
The worst customer service I've ever had. I will never buy another item in any location ever again because of the manager and her staff. I asked for a small bag and was rudely told "you need to buy something in order for us to give you a bag." I guess the $1500 coat I was about to buy but threw back down wasn't enough for them.
Let me begin by saying, I haven't had the need for the collision services at Import Paint & Body and hope not to need them BUT.... my 2016 Porsche Cayenne had a couple of bird stains that were quite unsightly! Loren K. was very professional and assessed the damage and suggested I speak with Carlos. 

Carlos is IP&B's detail expert and was quite magical in making the stains disappear and suggested I might consider a CQuartz Finest paint coating to minimize future stains. This coating would also give my vehicle a "wet look" and yes my 955 is black! Well, I picked up my car today and it looks fabulous. This isn't an inexpensive coating and neither is the vehicle I had it applied to......but great value and good people to do business with!

Carlos's attention to my car was professional, honest and the results exceeded my expectations! If you're particular about your ride these are the Gentlemen you need to know....stop by and check out the inventory of upper end cars their working on day in and day out!
I swear. Some friends never steer me wrong when it comes to deliciousness. 

I was told the house special chicken is the thing to try at China Chili. However, after looking at the menu, and discovering an item by the name of pillow chicken that included the phrase "pillow shaped morsels" how could I resist? There was none of that resistance crap. That food was in my belly fast! The pillow chicken was chicken mixed with onion, bamboo shoot and I believe something else and breaded into little pillow sized wonder. It was laid on top of steamed broccoli and then covered in a black pepper sauce. I wish it was spiced with something more than pepper, but other than that I have no complaints. It was so filling (in the good way, not the I'm gonna get sick way like most Chinese I have) I was only able to eat half. 

I loved the huge round tables in the center with the lazy susans. They reminded me of ones at a fantastic restaurant near where I grew up. The inside is really spacious and has some fantastic traditional decor. The menu was so large that I found several things I'd like to try next time including a whole section of chow fun food. Fun? Yep. I'd like some.

Downside? The parking lot is tiny and narrow. Parking in a space perfectly if there are cars on both sides of the spot is a feat I'd love to see mastered.
I scheduled a move-in cleaning with the owner the day before we needed it done. I appreciated her getting back to me so quickly and her willingness to fit me into their schedule. That was about the extent of any positive experience I had with them.

I was given an arrival time of 2-3 pm. At 3, the owner contacted me saying the girls were running about half an hour late...no big deal. At 4:15, no one had come yet. I was then called by the crew saying they had run out of gas and would have to reschedule. I said that would not be possible because the reason I needed the cleaning done that day was because we were moving in the following day. They said they would try to get on the road and figure something out. At 6 pm they finally arrived. The girls were very sweet but on top of everything that had happened, I was expecting a thorough cleaning. They did a great job on the bathrooms but I felt everything else was either brushed over or not noticed at all. One reason we needed cleaning was because the previous tenants had a dog with very long hair. At the end of our cleaning, there was still hair and dirt on the "mopped" kitchen floor, the inside of the fridge, freezer and cabinets had not been touched. I don't know if my experience was a fluke but it added a lot of anxiety to an already stressful week. My husband and I have spent the last three days cleaning what should have already been a clean townhouse. I still ended up paying what I would have if the correct appointment time had been kept and at the end of all of it, I received an e-mail saying if I did a Yelp review I would receive $20 off my next appointment. So here I am, writing my review. Although I do not anticipate using my discount because I will not be using this company again.

Comment from Boba S. of Kung Fu Tea 
Business Owner
9\/19\/2016  Hello KATHIE

I appreciate you taking the time to write your thoughts and opinions about the Kung Fu Tea franchise.

I did some investigating on your visit today and I do apologize for some misunderstandings here.  I did ask KEVAN about this customization and he did not approve such a thing.  We are a franchise and unfortunately NOT allowed this.  I agree with you!  Mango&Passion is NOT a WACKY drink.  Alas the higher powers that be do not allow this.  In fact NEVER.  Trouble has been issued to us for such WACKY concoctions.  Silly?  I concur.

I do hope you re-consider your review about this matter.  We really can't do it.  Your disdainful rating will have to stay with us.  You can hate us, be long gone with us, and be happy at Starbucks.  We try our best and if we messed up your drink.. Sorry again.  

You can go to the other Kung Fu Tea... They will get in trouble.  In fact you just got them in trouble.  No stamp cards there either.  I think YOU should question them about it.  Not us.

Dominic
************UPDATE\/RESPONSE*** 9\/20\/2016**********************
Thank you for your reply.

Who are you suggesting I question, and about what?

As a point of clarification, in the past Kevan made these drinks for us himself. It wasn't necessarily a matter of needing his approval?... regardless, I completely understand now that it was not something he "should" have been doing and that you are bounded by rules.... rules that do not reflect amazing customer experiences.

Dominic I'd be more than happy to give your store the 5 stars it deserves, but you too are missing the big picture. You FAIL to acknowledge it in your reply as well. You failed to show us how much you CARE about our needs as the customer. You expressed understanding about our frustrations... BUT as the OWNER you offered NO further solutions... as simple as

 "I will continue to submit requests the to the powers that be for this alteration as I understand this change will make many of my customers happy." 

YOU are the person in the best position to express this need and push for the changes to occur. BUT you mentioned nothing of the sort. I'm a little disappointed.
Je suis sortie jusqu'à tard, après des mois et des mois! Rendu chez une amie vers 3h du matin et sur Guy et St-Antoine, nous commencions à avoir faim. Et à part une pizzeria louche de Verdun, il n'y avait pas de resto ouvert pour la livraison. Il fallait donc se déplacer pour manger. Désolé je ne suis pas assez riche pour foodora ou ubereat... Et du Mcdo..et bien, j'en ai mangé 3 fois en 2 semaines..  Anyways

 C'est alors que Yelp m'a aidé à trouver un resto à proximité et ouvert....Le Boustan était le choix judicieux! Nous nous sommes donc aventurer sur la rue des très jeunes  soupçons des sorties de clubs, qui chill encore à 3h40, car c'est sûrement leur première sortie avec Fake ID, je parle de la rue Crescent! Arrivé devant le fameux Boustan, il y en avait des petits jeunes souls avec leur spinner..et un line -up. Malgré le line-up, ça n'a pas pris de temps pour se faire servir! J'ai pris un classique
..le trio sandwich poulet, avec patates! 

Malgré mon ancienne vie de débauche, qui incluait des fois la rue Crescent, je n'avais jamais essayé le Boustan de Crescent. J'avais été à celui de Rivière-des-Prairies, qui était ok..mais sans plus...tsé tout est bon en y ajoutant de l'ail ou presque...! Il y avait du monde qui me parlait du Boustan...que c'était donc ben bon et tout...mais bon je ne les comprenais pas...car à RdP comme je vous dit c'était ordinaire...

Bref, sur mes patates j'ai demandé Humus et sauce à l'ail. J'adore quand le gars derrière le comptoir prend la cuillère remplie de sauce et y va d'un élan pour que la sauce tombe adéquatement sur les patates! Quand j'ai goûter au sandwich..j'ai compris pourquoi les gens capotait autant!! Le sandwich est tout chaud tout croustillant! Le poulet est malade mental  et les patates wow! Bref, c'est sûre que je recommande le Boustan peut importe l'heure! J'ai bien hâte d'y retourner miam!
I really enjoyed this spot. When reviewing I review 3 things. Quality of food, service, and ambience. 

Quality of the food was delicious. They have a ton of selections even for vegetarians which my wife and I loved. We had the eggplant parm patsy and the Greek patsy. Wow. Unreal. I'm sure anything you choose will be incredible. 

Service was great! Our servers name was Kacey. She was real sweet and asked if we needed anything multiple times. Good came out reasonably quick. Everyone was pretty friendly. 

Ambience was ok. We walked in and there really wasn't clear process on how to sit or where. After we found a table though (it's self seating) everything was great!

I highly recommend it.
Bad Daddy's food is very good but service and attitude can be a little spotty at this location. 

Specifically, Bad Daddy's is a poor choice for group get togethers. Last month, a group of 10 of us had reserved a table right at 5PM for a post-work get together. The restaurant was nearly empty when 6 of us showed up - 2 folks had a firedrill come up at the office they were tending to and the other 2 had gotten lost on the way to the restaurant. The hostess refused to seat us until everyone else arrived, which we found ridiculous, given that at most, 2 other tables in the restaurant were occupied and no one was waiting for a table besides us. We wanted to sit down after a long day and have drinks while we waited for our friends, but we couldn't do that until everyone was rounded up and accounted for.

I completely understand this policy at peak hours, when you can't have 2 people taking up a table for 10, but to set the policy in stone at non-peak hours when the restaurant is empty isn't good business. They lost extra drink sales while six of us stood awkwardly at the front door of a nearly empty restaurant waiting for a few minutes. Finally when the 2 lost teammates arrived they relented and gave us a table for 8, which they made sure we knew was "against their usual policy". With a sea of empty tables around us they wouldn't pull over an extra two top until our coworkers who had to deal with an issue at work arrived 20 minutes later - when the restaurant was still cavernously empty.

The food at Bad Daddy's is very good but I'm not a traditional burger fan. On this last visit, I searched for my favorite, the Banh Mi burger (which is a pork burger) only to find it's been taken off the menu. I had a hard time choosing between all of the other options, since they didn't really appeal to me. It's a shame they removed my favorite option. Their menu is somewhat limited.

If other people want to go to Bad Daddy's, I'll go with them, but after this last visit, I see no reason to initiate going there myself.
Disgusting.

Have you ever experienced a time where you are just craving sushi, so much that even a philadelphia roll platter would do? If so, have you ever been so revolted you couldn't finish the roll?

I hope you haven't. This was my first experience with that and I was left heartbroken and sad and wishing I had never decided to give this place a chance. 

While the decor is amazing, the menu looks unique and spectacular and even the rolls looked amazingly tempting when I brought them home, the love affair stops there. It's all superficial, and I don't date that type.
New little pub spot in north west Phoenix- land of chain restaurants only!  On a weekday my mom and I stop in for a late lunch.

You write your name and circle the food options... No wine menu?  Weird drink selection still in progress.  This new business mustn't underestimate the westsiders wish to get their drank on.

The Parmesan garlic wings were crispy but not overwhelmingly garlic. If I did not know the name of this dish, I would not pick garlic as the first flavor.  Yes I can see pieces of minced garlic but the flavor is not there.  Served with ranch & celery on a pizza tray... Big whoop. 

The pizza was some chiche "fun" name like the big kahuna or Chattanooga... Basically salami, pepperoni, pancetta.  Immediately it arrives looking greasy but we aren't scared to eat it.  As we dig in I realize it's all just slightly undercooked.

When a mature gentleman asks how everything is, I share this feedback that the food could be warmer.  We also share this with our server who is quite nice but not overly knowledgeable.

We are hoping to find a neighborhood spot with a little more flavor and attention to detail.
Love the hiking you can do here.  The railroad tunnel trail will give you spectacular views of Lake Mead, as well as some history lessons (if you stop and read all the signs).  You can even walk past "the boneyard", which is a fenced off area where they keep old parts from the dam itself.  You can either walk up on the bridge, or down below by the bridge.  I didn't do the tour inside the actual dam, but maybe next time.
Lovely neighborhood, good parking, retro vibe.

The employee working was very friendly and let me try a couple samples. They had some obscure flavors and some normal ones. I was told all the ice cream was made on property. I went with the Smores Sundae, which was 2-3 scoops of chocolate ice cream, graham crackers, hot fudge and marshmallow fluff, which they actually take a blow torch to resemble a cooked marshmallow! The sundae itself was huge, I could have (and should have) split it with someone else. It was $8.15 though, which to me is really expensive for a sundae! 

I would definitely come back- maybe skip the sundae and try a cone instead!
I came here for lunch one day and had their "Bunless Gourmet Turkey Burger" (100% ontario ground turkey topped with dry fruit chutney, served with sweet potatoes wedges and grilled asparagus). The burger was a bit dry and the "serving" of grilled asparagus consisted of two spears of asparagus. In my opinion, that's hardly worth mentioning in the item's description on the menu. In addition, I found that some of the sweet potatoes were overcooked.

It is a bit deceiving as it is a restaurant that is trying to position itself as a healthy living choice, but when you look at the nutritional information online, it is hardly any better than a Pickle Barrel \/ Jack Astor's \/ Milestone's type of restaurant.

The ambiance is nice and the waiters are generally knowledgeable, but I would not rush back any time soon.
Standard generic North American breakfast. Pricey but what do you really expect.
Comme Par Hasard (literally "for as random," or "by chance") is a cute old home in old downtown Longueuil converted into this very nice and cozy Bistro. It feels like you were invited to a friend's or Grandma's house for dinner, with old traditional chairs and decor, soft lighting, and really friendly service. 

They have a good local biere (beer) menu that has strong beers (7.75% to 9% alcohol) as well as beers on tap and foreign bottles. There is a daily changing chalkboard of specials and favorites.

The three of us all opted for the same daily special, an Okoberfest special with weiners, sauerkraut, with side spoons of dijon mustard, served with pomme frites and 2 small glasses of beer (biere blanc et rouge). The special ($21.95) included  soup or salad. The soup was a deicious pumpkin cream, and the salad included pumpkin, cheeese, greens and beets. 

Dessert was a large mix of chocolate pudding and chocolate mouse, but they had many other choices, like pumpkin creme brulee.

Prices were not astronomical and service was very friendly and welcoming. I would recommend this place for friends, romance or business.
I've been hearing raving reviews of this place for a long time now and finally had the chance to try it out last weekend. I've never had Venezuelan food or arepas before, and I am now a big fan!

My friend and I tried the fire wood beef, shredded chicken, and pork butt arepas, and they were all delicious. My favorite is the fire wood beef one, the beef was super tender and flavorful! Make sure you try them with the two sauces (not sure what they are called), the creamy green one is very good! And definitely try the fried plantains, I love the little bit of char on them, so sweet and delicious!
Good food, good people, an amazing place if you're interested in genuine Mexican people and real people.
I wish this franchise had additional locations in the area.  One with a drive-thru would be ideal. This one is tucked away among a strip mall. Next door is some chain pizza place, and a Chilis. The other side is a Jason's deli- parking at lunch time is trying (especially when it's 114 degrees out). Come to think about it, everything in this area I have not frequented in a year. Probably last place in this area I was in was the Home Depot. 
Be sure to obtain a 'punch' card, yes indeed - another card one must add to their ever growing collection ha!  I did a Yelp check in and received. Free size upgrade- score for me! More calories;)
As I waited for my order (frozen lemonade and a frozen mocha something)!  Don't judge, it's quite the sauna outside.  I did a quick ladies room stop and no soap. Scratching my head. I took a picture and then informed the staff. This is the reason for the here stars. 
Now, my drinks were made quickly and quite tasty!  Staff is friendly, but busy since it is a suana outside. 
I didn't receive one of those umbrellas: who grows out of those! Come on, let's admit that is a lure:)
Pretty good. Caesar salad was pretty typical, although it did come with two large asiago breadsticks that were yummy, and was huge for only $5.99. Lou's Phoenician was good but the amount of meat was kind of absurd...  I took off more than half of it. 'double bakes bread' does not mean it is baked before served. The bread was cold. The coleslaw was the kind that is slightly sweet. Fries were bomb.com ...wedge style :) Pastries were also reallllly good.
I have been wanting to try this place after learning about the benefits of a raw food diet and after having lunch here I must say that this will be my go to place. I love the building that Luna's is located in plenty of windows for sunshine and beautiful hard wood flooring . This place has an ultra sleek big city metropolitan feel to it. I started my lunch with the falafel sampler and it was delicious it also came with a yummy hummus and delicious pickled vegetables. As my drink I tried the chai latte which is made in house it puts Starbucks to shame. As my main entree I had the Rawco Taco salad and thought I was in heaven . To top it all off I had dessert it was a pumpkin like cheese cake and it was amazing . Even if your not vegan this is a place that is a must try for everyone. The staff is friendly and the food is good for you and the planet ! It's a win win for everybody .
I will NEVER go back to this ridiculous place again.  And don't think this is from one bad experience.  No, this is from not one, but two bad experiences.  First time I went I made the appointment I told them that my hair was dyed a medium chocolate brown and I wanted some caramel highlights. I knew that having dye in my hair would not make the highlights exactly caramel, so my expectations were rational.
The instructor was present for the first five minutes then disappeared, until the student started to panic a bit and he showed up to shrug his shoulders a little then walked off.  In the end I was left with three toned hair, NO highlights, and my hair was fried.  I've had highlights done before (under similar hair circumstances) and this has not happened.  I however didn't know that they had ruined my hair until I got home and realized what had happened (better light).  I called them the next day to ask about what they could do for me, and all they could offer me was to come back in the next 7 days to have the colour corrected.  Which was unacceptable because I had to work and could not be in their salon in time, and besides my hair was already over processed to be dyed again.  The woman on the phone was not empathetic with me at all, and did not see the fact that not only was I out $100, I was also now an extra $60 in the hole because I had bought some hair masks to treat my over processed hair.  They were rude and  were not going to try and rectify the issue with me at all.

The second time was last September.  My friend was getting married and being the person that I am I gave Aveda Academy another chance.  I made the appointment almost three months in advance for a simple cut and style (no colour, I learned my lesson).  The week of the wedding my Nana died so now I was going to a Funeral and a Wedding all in one weekend.  That Saturday as I walked to my appointment (early in the morning) I got a call from them telling me that my hair dresser had been in a minor accident, and that my appointment had been canceled.  I asked them if they had anyone to just trim my hair and give it a quick blow dry.  I expressed my sincere concern about the injured stylist, but then explained my problem of having the Wedding and Funeral.  After all this I received ZERO empathy and not even an iota of effort to try and help me.  
So I was left wandering around the city trying to find a stylist, with a Wedding that afternoon and my Nana's Funeral the next day.  

I think that it's a 50\/50 thing there.  I have friends that have had amazing experiences there, and I've encountered people who have had ones like mine.  So it's worth it if you don't mind a gamble.  Me... I won't be gambling with this place again.
This is a most stop for me and my girlfriend whenever I'm back in TO. We always order:

- the radish cake 
- calamari 

both are really good - but it is a bit spicy.

And typically we will order a congee (you really can't go wrong with any of them) and a noodle dish.

What can I say? Congee and noodles is always good.
The most important part of this review can be summed up on 2 words- DOG. FRIENDLY. 

Really awesome little local brewery right on the North Side! There's a big parking lot right next door and although they dont serve food, there are restaurants within walking distance and occasionally they do have a food truck parked outside! And it's ok that they don't serve food because that means you can enjoy a nice brewsky with your best friend sitting right beside you (I'm referring to your dog, of course)! And when I say they're dog friendly, I mean that whole heartedly.. They honestly LOVE dogs and want you to bring them! 

Second most important piece of information is that they really do have great beer! They offer flights so you can taste more than 1 before making your decision, and I love that they also offer a size that's smaller than a pint, for those of us who like beer but maybe can't properly handle it in larger (normal) serving sizes ;) 

The inside is small but really cool, and when the weather is nice they open up their garage door so you can sit and mingle outside as well. AND, they even help fundraise for local animal shelters by hosting events and brewing special beers to raise money! Really though, what more could you possibly ask for? :)

The owners are super nice and the patrons are friendly, so you'll always feel welcome and I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself!
So I've only bought a few things from this place but let me just say besides there ridiculous prices in upset with the service. We just walked by and heard the girls cussing there heads off. Because that's definitely how you get customers. Shame on you. My husband and I will never be customers of yours ever again just because of the low standards we encountered today.
The below review is a mystery to me because it's entirely contrary to our experience this past Saturday.  We were working on cleaning out our house to put it on the market and had a garage full of stuff to throw away.  On a lark, we called Erik and he came that afternoon.  He asked us several questions about how much there was and could one person haul it, etc.  He said he'd had plenty of experiences with people misstating how much the job was.  He and my husband loaded the dump truck and off he went (after having to pin us down for an address -- we forgot to give him the street number!).  $225 all said and done.  Completely worth it.
I enjoy the juicy, succulent taste of murder, but I've also got friends that would skin me if I took them to a steak house. To avoid compromising the values of my veggie friends by forcing them to make me man meat, it's always best to choose a place with plenty of greens on the menu. Pita Jungle is the perfect harmony between flesh renders and herbivores. And it doesn't just have the "hold the chicken" type vegg friendly option on the menu, it's got lentils and shit.

Now, since we've already established that I live under rocks, you can just go ahead and assume I've never been to Pita Jungle. What can I say, the grub hunting was good. But after my first visit you can bet your skinny little vegan ass I'll be noshing right next to you on a regular basis. 

The restaurant has apparently expanded twice since it's been open and it was still hoppin' last night, with an open, airy feel and interesting artwork decorating the walls. We hovered over the seating section booth thingy and were told to go ahead and steal any open seat we liked. Some may find this annoying and unorganized, but I really like it when they let me do that part of their job for them, so we snagged a table for two right next to the window so I could watch some dog TV, which was showing a tig old biddy sorority girl special based on the number of perky young freshman coming and going in the parking lot. (Side note: Big old windows are like big screen dog TVs because dogs don't watch human TV, they keep track of the cats trotting through their territory and bark at the mailman and monitor the comings and goings of the neighborhood through windows. At least in my experience. I'll be sitting there glued to the tube and the dogs will be sitting there glued to the window. End tangent. Thanks for your patience.)

Others have complained about the poor service at this location, but surprise (sarcasm) Mr. Man ends up knowing the waiter assigned to our section, so we were promptly rewarded with menus and drinks. Not that I would have even noticed the wait since I was agape, trying to take in everything offered on a menu that just wouldn't quit. Eventually I grabbed hold of my indecision and narrowed it down to three options, the black bean burger, the lavosh shawarma wrap, or the Caribbean salad. We agreed that not having hummus simply wasn't an option so I went with the shawarma so I could pep it up with some left over hummus, and I really dig lavosh because it reminds me of saltines, which I don't really like that much, but are scrumptious in flatbread form. Mr. Man decided upon the grilled vegetable salad, because if you've ever met him, he really needs to watch his boyish figure (again, sarcasm).

We ordered an extra pita for the hummus, which was overkill and we didn't even end up touching it because the "small hummus" ended up being freakin' huge and the pita was sized to match. It was smooth and creamy, and garnished with two of my favorite vegetables (or whatever an olive technically is), cucumbers and kalamata olives! My one gripe about the entire meal was that my chicken was overly dry and a smidgen bland, but the hummus more than made up for that lack in flavor. The side Greek salad that came with my wrap was also stupendous, with a hefty amount of feta and a delicious, light vinaigrette to counter that richness. Mr. Man's grilled vegetable salad was also very well done, with crisp veggies, lots of garlic and an awesome dressing. 

And this delish bounty of fresh, healthy food came to 20 bucks between the two of us and left us with enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I'll definitely be coming here again, and frequently, so I can get my daily dose of granola crunching hippies, sorority sisters, cooler than thou hipsters and SUV driving yuppies with their childrens all in one place. Unheard of!
This was my first time at Margaritaville. They had cool decor. I thought the boat tables and volcano were cool. We shared the Jamaica Mistaica chicken wings as an appetizer. They were really good! The sauce was tasty, just a little kick - not really spicy at all. I got the fish sandwich - blackened. I wasn't expecting anything great, but there were two big pieces of fish on my sandwich. It was really good, and the seasoning was delicious. My friend ordered the taco salad, and it looked delicious. She said it was. We were both surprised that we were happy and stuffed before even finishing our meals. I would definitely come here again.
4.5 Stars overall

Very friendly service and patrons. Came in on a Saturday afternoon for a quick beer and a pint glass. I had been looking for something unique in the area and didn't love the beers at SanTan and wasn't able to go to Four Peaks on 8th as the line was insane on a Saturday afternoon. 

Overall I thought the beers were pretty good for my bastardized Cali IPA based frame if reference. I enjoyed the Magic in the Ivy. I also tried a few of their other beers, Fresh Magic, which wasn't so fresh anymore as it is a Wet Hop beer that was about 4 months old and I had their IPA. The That'll Do IPA was a 3\/5 but not that amazing when compared to what I'm used to. 

I loved the fact that the taproom was set up to be very social and also they had other beers featured as well. I liked that I could come in and taste the Huss brews and then also some other unaffiliated beers as well. I had the Super IPA collaboration from New Belgium and Alpine as well. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Huss and thought the level of service was fantastic. the prices are also insanely reasonable to fill your growler and if I lived local would have bought one without hesitation. I'll definitely go back my next time in Tempe
I've been to Heck's twice now, once for Sunday brunch and another time for lunch. The brunch menu was pretty diverse so we ordered the short rib hash and the chicken and waffles to share. I enjoyed both, but I'm a sucker for braised beef. 

For lunch, we all ordered burgers and they make a darn good burger. 

I also really love sitting in the atrium. It's so relaxing and the natural light is perfect. The restaurant has a "regular" dining room as well that could accommodate larger parties.  

Service was exceptional both times.
Time for a four legged haircut!

Periodically I bring my Italian Greyhound here to get his hair cut, nails filed and gland fixed up. This is not a bad little groomer, it's tucked away next to Red Rock Running Co, along West Cheyenne.  

Darcy's is pretty effective when dealing with trouble little makers like my hulk of 9 lbs. I usually just drop him off in the morning and pick him up in the afternoon. Each dog has there own little kennel so no real fighting happens. They do except appointments but I have found the drop off method always best.

Everything is cash here. Also make sure to ask what the price is, the groomers never really tell you till it's time to pay. Also handy hint, if you forgot cash, just head over to the magoos, they have a ATM.

Overall
Cleanliness: 3-5
Service: 3-5
Price: 2-5
Come back: yeah why not
Ehhhh,

Service spotty, food didnt come out as ordered. Some food came out ten minutes before others and we only had a party of 4. 

Odd experience overall and then we the food finally arrived it wasnt even that good. Maybe a bad experience maybe not but next time I'll probably pass on Holstiens.
I guess it would be unfair to say that EVERYONE who works here is just not nice... But I think its pretty accurate.  I have encountered the occasional friendly face ( usually at check out.. But not always) but for the most part, its just a bland, semi-unpleasant experience. Sure they have everything you would expect of a drugstore but if you're looking for a place that actually does customer service, keep driving. There's a Walgreen's right next store.
Get in my belly!

So I have been going to this place since I was little. There's nothing like this green chili. Only second best to my moms of course. I live in Arizona and I only have a hand full of Mexican food places I will go . This is one of them. 
We took my itty bitty mother in law who eats very conservatively . She downed that bean burrito before we could even open our containers! My husband an I get the green chili chimichanga. Tastes like Christmas in my mouth. We only go on special occasions but the drive is worth it each time.  

Now the hours are limited and it is a hole in the wall (well the hood).
You will wait a while. Especially if you go around lunch time. However we think its worth it all.
I came here for dinner on a Saturday night with a group of about 11 people. Our server, Megan, was great at handling the size of the party and our various needs as we had a lot of questions and many specific requests for our various meals.

I ordered the grilled jerk calamari which was pretty good, although I did not taste the jerk seasoning. It came with arugula and pickled onions which were actually really tasty (and I don't usually like them.

Other diners in the group ordered a variety of dishes (e.g. Burgers, fish and chips, chicken panini, etc.) and everyone was quite pleased with their choices with the exception of one girl. She ordered the pesto chicken salad, and she didn't really like it. I gathered that the chicken was cold and the fish just wasn't what she was expecting.

The ambiance is pretty casual, although I understand that a dance floor opens up there later in the night, we just didn't stick around to see it. 

I'd go back for a meal, casual drinks, or to partake in the dance floor!
Will was great from day 1.  He was super responsive and helped me with all my questions.  Every guest at our wedding loved the food.  One word of advice, if it is yo ur wedding or you are hosting the event, skip the line and go first as there will will not be left overs.  Everyone went back for seconds (a few for thirds and fourths) and had plenty!!!  I would recommend Will for any type of gathering and Pedro who manned the grill was awesome!!!! I only hope I can come up with a new occasion to bring them back!!!!!

I also rented chairs and tables from them and that was so helpful to have them delivered.

Thanks Will!!!!
Booked our hotel way last minute
Total came out to be 140$ for two nights Killer deal!!! If you split the cost with 4 girls I feel like it's an awesome deal
Plus they have an after hour club inside the hotel that doesn't close till 12:00 noon! Definitely coming back!!!
A born and bred Toronto friend brought me here claiming it to be a favourite of his. 

We tried eggplant in black bean sauce (an off menu item the waitress offered to put together) and the ho fun lo mien. The food was great - on the oily side but who cares it was tasty! 

The service was quite slow and we had to really wave to get water and later our bill. They also forgot part of our order and we had to remind them. That's the reason I bumped them down from 4 to 3 stars. 

Would recommend - it's vegetarian friendly and delicious! Just go in feeling patient!
This is my favorite place to stop in at after a long day. They took the time to learn my name and order. I am greeted when i come in and the wait is almost always shorter than expected. 
Just be aware that they do get busy in the evenings as people grab dinner on their way home.

The bobby is great, but the chicken cheese steak is my favorite. Always hot and yummy. Great sandwhich and the price is decent.
First night time visit to Mama's..wow this place is a goldmine..packed with people, pretty high noise level, but they were very accomodating when we added 2 extra people to our reservation.  The BREAD, yes it was incredible warm and soft and seasoned..not Italian bread but a lovely soft dinner roll -- very addicting. Our waitress was very nice, fairly fast and concerned about our order. We started out with Calamari...not the right choice ..it was Mrs. Pauls...thick heavy breaded with all the same size rings?? Our friends had the Bruschetta --it looked very good. Our Drinks came and they were not made correctly but the waitress cheerfully took them back to the bar and brought out another version, still not right -- and irritating when we got the check and it was 8.20 for the drink and 2.50 for the bar brand liquor in it. That means we paid 8.20 for club soda and a cherry..hmmmm
I ordered the Spaghetti all Gricia..it was thin spaghetti and caramelized onions, applewood smoked bacon, and pecorino cheese. Very interesting..not Italian but really good ..but I would rename it Bacon Lo Mein...My Husband ordered the Lasagna, he said it was good but the meat was stringy?? Our friends had the Pollo Romano, which was basically a Chicken Parm, it was a great size portion, and seemed like our friend enjoyed it. Her partner had the Cotoletta ala bolognese, it was a fried chicken cutlet topped with Parmesan cheese and proscuitto, It was also a nice size portion but it was swimming in grease, like the cheese had melted and they used to much oil to fry it..they did replate it for my friend but she could still not eat it and they very nicely took it off the bill. 
The desert....was the VERY best thing on the menu--NUTELLA PIE..It was a combo of Nutella, peanut butter, marscapone cheese with a graham cracker crust...heavenly, I would have eaten more but I had filled up on the bread!
All in all..its a okay dinner place...not authentic Italian at all..Large family style portions, but not my AMORE...Loved our company..not so much the meal..Sorry Mama....
I went to 5th Avenue Cafe today ready to have some brunch (well breakfast food really). I absolutely love breakfast. Aside from ice cream, it's my favorite. 

The atmosphere was okay. We were at a huge table off to the side due to the large number of people in our party. I quickly noticed that the fans in the building did not cover the one half of our table. We had to fan ourselves with items we could find at the table. We were asked if we wanted separate checks, which was a nice bonus with a large table.

I ended up ordering an omelet, hash browns, and rye toast. The hash browns and the omelet were a little drier than I would've hoped for. I don't like greasetastrophes, but I do like a little flavor. It was, however, a large portion of food, and I ended up only being able to finish half of it.

It wasn't bad to the point that I won't ever go back again, but I'm not sure it will be on my list of places to visit in a hurry.
This place is a navigation disaster that lacks character. Of any kind.

I remember the first time I went to Tempe Marketplace, shortly after moving as it had a lot of things I was needing to pick up to give a sense of home to the new pad. The only thing other than that I remember is that I left so frustrated and mind blown that I needed ice cream therapy stat. 

If you're headed to the parking lots near Lucille's and what not to head to the main strip of smaller stores, you will probably find yourself not knowing where to park in order to get to the specific store you are trying to access. You will be way off base from where you guessed you were and end up confused and lost and bitter. 

By that point, all you want to do is get the thing you came for and leave as quickly as possible. You're not going to want to stay and shop and browse or sit by the outdoor fireplace (which is on when it's hot out.. WTF).

With that being said, sometimes I still come here. Lucille's is a work favorite. BevMo is a needed stop at times and if I need to run errands at Michaels or Target after work, it's nearby. But those are the only reasons. Tempe Marketplace has become the last place I think of shopping at when I have some time to kill or feel like browsing for a new dress.
An expensive Asian restaurant that just happened to be in the middle of a casino - that's Grand Wok for you. 

I went here with my boyfriend for lunch on a Wednesday. The service here was excellent. Our server kept pouring us tea and I appreciate that he paid that much attention to us. Really commendable. I was just not impressed by the food. 

For appetizers, we had the chicken lettuce cups. The flavor was good and the amount of chicken was more than adequate. They even asked if we wanted more lettuce when we finished the plate and still had some chicken left. For our entrees, my boyfriend ordered three different rolls of sushi (totally forgot to take note of them) and I ordered the XO pork udon noodles. Everything tasted great just nothing impressive. It is just typical Chinese\/Japanese food. 

Our bill ended up at around $40\/person. For that much you can eat at any quality all-you-can eat restaurant elsewhere. I think it was just the ambience that you pay for here not exactly the food.
This a cool place to hang out and have a beer. They have excellent fish & chips. It is inside the Rampart Casino. I like to go here in Sundays after I put a few bets in at the sports book on some NFL games. I would recommend you try this place if you like fish & chips.
This is the first time for me to eat a Vegetarian meal, so please note that the review is based from a meat-eater perspective. The restaurant is quite small so remember to make a reservation, as the wait can be 15-30 minutes.

*Drinks: 
-Sweet Ginger Tea with green tea, raw ginger and maple syrup - $5: I don't like ginger so I didn't taste this, but my friend enjoyed it and she had a sore throat coming, so this helped to calm her throat :). 
-gojiccino -$5: a cappuccino-style beverage made from pure goji berries. I LOVE this drink. Surprisingly it doesn't taste fruity. The taste is very unique: naturally sweet, taste like a mocha but with a herbal finish. 

*Food: 
-poutine -$8: The portion was huge! I enjoyed this dish but unfortunately I couldn't taste the cheese. For me the cheese curds are a big part of poutine, but again this is a pure vegetarian poutine, so I can look past that. The fries were thick and I believe they were baked, but I wished they were a bit more crispy though.The gravy is made from smoked mushrooms and it was not too heavy, quite light and very smooth.

-bbq burger - $12:  The onion rings were well cut, not like the skinny pitiful stringy type of onion rings. They were coated with puffed quinoa batter and fried (or baked?), really crispy and delicious! I didn't get to try the burger but my friend loved it.

-Buddha Fresh Bowl - baby size with soba noodle - $11.50: quite disappointed with this dish. Luckily I chose the baby size too, as the normal size would have costed me $17. The tofu steaks tasted like cooked meat. The marinade for this dish was on point and it was cooked to perfection. The peanut sauce overpowers the ingredients and made the dish really heavy. I suppose the fresh vegetables (tomato, cucumber, bean sprouts) were supposed to cut down the heaviness of the dish, but it did little to nothing. My friend tried it and she agreed that the dish was really heavy as well. Furthermore, the soba noodles were overcooked and turned soggy. In my opinion, the soba noodles should be cooked, rinsed and served cold for this dish to work. Because the noodles were hot and sat at the bottom of the bowl, the noodles continued cooking, while soaking the peanut sauce, which made the noodles soggy. I ended up eating the tofu steaks and picked pieces of vegetables to eat lol.

Overall, while my experience wasn't good, I would come back and try other dishes. If you don't know what to order, I recommend ordering the burgers and quinoa onion rings. Although these are vegetarian dishes, they really fill you up and most dishes are tasty, while being nutritious :).
While the same grumpy horrible shift manager works here. The food is just so yummy I had to come back. And the manager is so bubbly and sweet as are 99% of the people that work here. 

The tables are kept clean, they come around often and check in with you. 

Just keep in mind the food is cooked to order and avoid the drive through, its just not very quick.
Casey Jones has been a local favorite for many years! My family and I have come here many times and it's always been a good time. 

Definitely one of the best places for wings in the area. They recently added hot dogs to the menu and the Chicago Hot Dog was awesome. 

Menu consists of mainly bar food and beer but everything they serve is delicious. Great place to come to watch the game or hangout with family any time of the week. Plenty of TVs to watch and always fast and friendly service.

Don't pass up Casey Jones if you're in the area!
I got a small Margherita pizza and a side mixed green salad. It was amazing! Great dressing on the salad and the pizza was perfect too. I will definitely be back.
The fries are great they give you a ton. The burgers are alright, I like that they give you the topping at no extra charge, but they are pricey for a greasy burger joint. They are defiantly the place to go when you are hungry. If you are a tiny eater they are not you place. Free peanuts too.
We were early so normal atmosphere was average. 

Service was great. Knowledge. Personable. Conversational rather than scripted. 

Food was unique and excellent.
We ate here a month or so ago and I can't wait to visit again. It was my first visit and I really enjoyed it.

The food was great! Or maybe the Hurricane I had made it seem that way.

Prompt and friendly service! Great food! 

We'll be back soon.
This is a very nice park. We have started bringing our dog here for nightly walks and he loves it. There's plenty of space for exercise but it's also a great spot for lounging around in the cool fall weather. Looking forward to utilizing this park that is so close to home for us!
Make sure to add Lenny Boy to your growing list of go-to Charlotte breweries! 

Lenny Boy's beers are great but their kombucha is FIRE! My faves include the Good Ol' Ginger, Lavenderade, Wake Up Call!, Watermelon (seasonal), and Sweet Potato Pie (seasonal). 

I suppose you can always double fist and get yourself a beer and a 'booch. Better yet, get yourself a beer\/booch mix. Just ask a bartender for some suggestions. They also offer smaller pours (6oz) and flights.

The newer location is a big improvement from their first space. Tons of room to sit and relax. A patio for your 4-legged friends to hang out with you. FYI: Dogs are not allowed in any brewery space. Not the breweries rules but a law. A Bao Time is their resident food truck so you can always grab a bite.
After trying Binkley's, I wanted to try out their casual Cafe Bink. I've been here twice now and have had exceptional experiences both times. Service is attentive and prompt. Dylan W. was our server both times. He was great and would recommend! The food here is straightforward but made with exceptional ingredients. The last time I was here, I ordered the fries (which are awesome), a burger and a caesar salad. Everything was great! Fries came with a trio of sauces, including a garlic aioli and truffle ketchup. Caesar is made with homemade croutons and anchovies. I didn't think I liked anchovies but in the salad, they taste great. The burger was well made and delicious on the onion roll. For dessert, we tried the nutella creme brule, which was outstanding! It also came with chocolate chip cookies on the side. Yumm-o!! 

It's a bit of a drive if you aren't already in North Scottsdale, Carefree or Cave Creek but well worth it! It's small inside, has a nice bar and a beautiful patio that has a great view of the mountains and desert scene. Prices are a bit high but food is great!

Will keep returning!
I ordered here for the first time because it was the only Chinese in my area that delivers. I was impressed how fast the food came, still very hot and fresh. Everything was good but my favorite was lo mein and kung pao chicken. Portions were good. It is the best Chinese I have had so far. I recommend this place anyone looking to tryout good Chinese food.
Definitely a great place to buy gifts for someone with discerning tastes. The ability to mix and match your own boxes of truffles and pralines is a nice touch since you can tailor your selections.

I had a slice of cake from them as well -- I forget what it was called, but it was a nut creme of some sort with blueberry, I believe? This was a while ago. Needless to say I was impressed because not only was the cake rich, and obviously of top quality, but it was not excessively sweet, which is a very nice touch.

I heartily recommend Stubbe. It's pricey, but you get what you pay for, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
REALLY enjoyed my meal here.  Was dying to try it as Grit and Grace and by the time I pulled the trigger...it was...not.  So...G&G Noodle bar...

Small Plates:  get the General Tso's Cauliflower.  I'm serious.  Do it.  Now. 

Entree:  I had the Dan Dan Noodles and they were delicious.  

Atmosphere:  was dark but trendy casual.  My only complaint was my seat, that sort of stuck out into the main aisle.  

Bar:  I had El Luchador (the El Luchador seems redundant) and it was just as smoky and spicy as I'd hoped...a little ginger, a little mezcal, some jalapeno.  I stopped at two, and if I wouldn't have been on a time crunch would have sampled a couple others that looked intriguing.  

Seemed like a nice place to take a group.  Maybe not the MOST romantic place, but still a good date destination if you're not popping the question and just want to enjoy conversation, drinks and good food.
Sandy Bell's is best known for its nightly session; a lot of sessions can descend into chaos with a surfeit of guitars and squeezeboxes, but on the night we went everything was very nicely balanced. The bouzouki and flautist were especially good and they had a solid bunch of tunes (not just Irish ones) in their noggins.

There's also a chess board high up on a ledge round the corner in a small nook; you have to ask at the bar for the box of pieces and the clock. The pieces come in a sticky plastic box that has clearly been baptised in beer many times but they themselves are clean, and the nice big kind you can properly plonk down on the board. For the first time ever, I beat my brother (then for the second and third time. Perhaps I had an unfair advantage in that I was only drinking water and he was trying out the whisky stock...) and the lad at the bar was thrilled to entertain some chess players. Apparently they used to have a chess club but most of the players got barred, so he hasn't seen chess going on for a while!

In terms of its interior and atmosphere, it's a fairly standard pub; not much different from what I expect from the word "pub", although my brother was reasonably impressed with the range of whiskies on offer. The highlight for me was a copy of "Brecht On Theatre" on the bookshelves! Now there's something you don't see every day... So: chess, session, and Brecht lift this above the average pub for me. Nice one, Sandy's.
My dog "Gibson" is in the Palm Glen Animal Hospital as I write this review. I've been dealing with Dr. Mangone and the Palm Glen staff for a couple of years now. Even though I'm not sure what Gibson's outcome is going to be, I am comfortable and confident that he's receiving the best care and comfort on this planet. These people are saints and I would never think of taking my pets anywhere else.

Michael Anderson
Love all their bubble tea especially the Taro Sago with less ice and no sugar. The service is always great here.
This place is just plain magic. Obviously it's very tiny and not really a sit down place but whatever -- their waffles are out of this world good. 

I went for breakfast (because who turns down waffles with ice cream at 9am?) and got the liege waffle with speculoos sauce, bananas and their cinnamon ice cream. 

If you come here, please do yourself a favour and don't get a boring flavour like vanilla ice cream. The beauty of this place is their interesting flavs and I'm telling you their cinnamon ice cream is DELICIOUS! And if you don't get speculoos sauce you're doing yourself a disservice and also probably making the entire country of Belgium weep.
Good food and service. We had the Brooklyn Bridge pizza and it was delicious! One note, don't order their bloody mary's, just go for beer and wine. The bloody mary's are from a mix and they don't even have Tobasco to spice it up!
The other two reviews are pointless. I'm excited to move into my apartment! Stephanie from the leasing office has been so dedicated in helping me find exactly what I was looking for. 

She has spent so much time on the phone with me, answering all of my questions, has been so upbeat, and in her time off has taken pictures of the unit and sent them to me! Talk about going the extra mile to get the business well done!.The unit looks beautiful. I love the amount of space you get for the price. And I'm 3 minutes from my new job so I'm stoked. Can't wait to move back to Charlotte! Thank you again Stefanie!
Mirror Mirror what a darling name for a great salon!  It's a beautiful purple salon with all sorts of Snow White themed artifacts ! Ashley Nicole is the Stylist who is a color expert here! I have gone to a lot of stylists around Charlotte and believe me this girl is the best. She highlights and lowlights my hair. The colors are extraordinary! She has great ideas for colors and the newest trends! She is also a braid expert - she can make you look like a Princess Laia! I would tell you to try this Southend Salon . I love it !
It's a Safeway! Nothing too crazy about this place. Has all your standard staff. 

I will mention that it is however usually short on cashiers.

It has a Redbox and a decent flower selection.
Hidden in the east end of the Danforth, who knew there would be a little Ethiopian community?

The decor is definitely interesting. Although, the outside has lots of lights as decoration, the inside is kind of dark. The red lighting and orange menu makes it hard to read.

The food is not bad. Although they tell you that the vegetarian platter is only for one person - this platter is definitely made for sharing!
After checking out Trip Advisor (a million times) we chose to say at the MGM Signature (rated #1 on Trip Advisor). This place was AMAZING! I would never stay at another place again. The hotel is gated so not everyone can walk in and out of your hotel. All the rooms are suites. Our room had a bathroom with his and her sinks. There was a HUGE glass shower and Jacuzzi. The room had one king size bed, desk with chairs, a couch and arm chair, mini kitchen and a big walk in closet. There was also a iPod dock and flat screen TV with a DVD player. Since it was a private hotel they gave you free complimentary water which is great because water is around $7 a pop. We also had a balcony that overlooked the strip. Everyone who worked at the hotel was very friendly and helpful. They even let us print out our boarding passes at the front desk so we didn't have to check in at the airport when we were leaving. Also, because we were staying at the signature we were able to access MGM casino, pools, restaurants, etc for free. They also gave us $25 towards breakfast at delights (very good food) and a $25 actives card that you could use towards any of the shows\/restaurants in the hotel or MGM Casino. The price tag for this hotel is pretty high, but we booked out stay through hotels.com and ended up only paying for 2 nights (buy two nights get the third free).
I think this one ends up getting between a 3 and a 4 star (if only I could do half-stars here) from me, and here's why...

Pros: the food is delicious!  And with plenty of options (I'm vegetarian), there's a lot of tasty options to choose from.  They'll also let you sample something if you've never tried it.  I recently moved here from the Midwest, and had never eat cactus before.  (Turns out it's yummy!)  I had two burritos, and they were very good.

Cons: the food is given in very small portions.  Usually I don't complain about this because I'm a small person, and huge portions are usually a waste (or a doggie bag).  But I also have a healthy appetite, and found that one burrito was not enough.  So, if you've never been here, be on the safe side and order two of whatever you're thinking of ordering.  The tacos are even smaller, so maybe three.  And I'm talking about a normal person who's feeling an average hunger level.  If you're starving, please go elsewhere (haha).

All that being said, it's definitely worth going to.  This is Mexican food, made by people from Mexico - i.e., the way Mexican food Should be.  It's authentic.  If you're visiting Vegas, don't go to Taco Bell.  Please don't go to Taco Bell.  Go to Taco Y Taco, instead.
I like ayce but what happened to those italian dishes? chefs are japanese and they do serve high quality sushi though. Smaller amount of rice compared to other ayce sushi joint, which, im sure is a good news to ladies. Too bad, only one order of dessert, bc im still dreaming of that green tea pannacotta. (update) Just came back from Nakamuraya... WOW, thanks yelpers!
First, the star-reducing factors: Somewhat high prices and extremely tiny parking lot, but those factors are to be expected with an LGO restaurant I suppose!  Make use of their "secret parking" by their corporate office a couple minutes walk down the street, past the (chained up!) dermatologist office and dry cleaners.  I also find the servers here to not be as personable as they could be, and they spent time talking amongst each other instead of checking up on customers and filling empty drink glasses.  I've also had a waitress "forget" to take my mother's order!  Unfortunately, I think they have been hired based on looks and not on experience.

Star-bestowing factor: FOOD!  I've tried the amazingly delicious Paris, Texas burger and the chicken schnitzel sandwich.  The burger was fantastic, especially on an English muffin and with an egg on top.  The breading came off of the chicken when I had that, though it was still tasty.  Definitely not "amazing" like the burger though!  The smashed potato fries are fantastic, though I prefer them with ketchup.  The "fries" are like deep fried slices of baked potato, seasoned with sea salt and cracked pepper.

Don't forget to take a couple free salted chocolate chip cookies for dessert!  It's kind of a pain to get them yourself, and I think that the servers should consider offering a small plate of them to customers.  The servers don't even tell you about the cookies, much less help you get them out from under their enclosure as you use the tiny pair of tongs and hope said cookies don't slide off the provided napkins!  This goes back to my star-reducing "decent but not great service" factor.

Overall, decent enough service and really great food mean I will be back, but will have to be motivated to drive further past the more easily-accessible and better-serviced Zin Burger at Biltmore Fashion Park.
My brother flung the door open with a flourish and strode in. "I'M TAKING YOU OUT FOR TURKISH," he announced. Bro, I am so there.

"There" was a little spot in Newington, huddling glumly in the blackness of a wet November night. No glumness was within, however: we were seated with jovial alacrity by the window, with some upbeat discussion of the view (sky water falling on road water, and some road water attempting in hissing salmon jumps to go back up to being sky water).

Seated in the dimness of almost total candlelight with the occasional orange flare of flame from the kitchen beside us, we were given a tour of the heating options (overhead and under the table). They brought us a little battery-powered lamp while we browsed the menu - such a thoughtful and cute touch.

We ordered three meze to start us off - herring salad, squid and walnut salad, and honeydew melon with feta cheese. Woah. The herring was deliciously sweet, fresh and syrupy; the squid had clearly at some point in its recent past actually been a squid, and the honeydew... hoooooooooo. I was expecting a couple of delicate slices but we were given a great bowl full of melony chunks and a goodly wadge of feta unexpectedly topped with mint, which was a lovely touch.  These three dishes alone were almost enough but we decided to get some mains as well since it was so good!

For Bro, grilled lamb. For Sis, vegetable moussaka. I'm told the lamb was awesome. As for my moussaka - well, I'm used to moussaka being something of a slop. A tasty slop, but slop nonetheless. This, however, had not only flavour but form and texture. It cut in neat slices and was quite the revelation - absolutely delicious. We rounded it all off with some gorgeous sticky baklava too, and the whole bill - illuminated by the return of the little battery-lamp - came to £50. Amazing.

We sat there for a pretty long time waiting for the downpour to abate and never once felt rushed or like the staff were waiting for us to go. Once the sky water had finally all become road water, we left feeling about three stone heavier, but a fresh and healthy weight rather than just a lump of stodge. This was a meal I'll remember for a long time. Nonetheless, I might feel compelled before long to, er... refresh my memory...
You know when the first thing you can say about a restaurant is something about the decor means it's not a good sign, so I won't talk about the food , which was mediocre. The decor reminded me of Ceconne's in WeHo, with an Art Deco twist. The music was a little disconnected...I enjoyed the night in great company.
Great atmosphere to meet for drinks, loved the huge windows and high ceilings
My wife and I stopped here after shopping. I had a liter of their lightest pilsner along with artichoke dip and seated tuna we both shared. DELICIOUS!! She continued on with the 12 ounce steak which was a perfect medium rare. She nearly swooned at how melt in her mouth tasty it was. I ordered the Lamb Lollipop plate.  FANTASTIC. 
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!

We will be back.
We came here on the weekend with a large group for brunch. Very friendly service and very accomodating to our group. Food was great but it took awhile for the food to come out.  I had the prosciutto eggs benny and my eggs were cooked perfectly. Also tried the breakfast pizza (comes with spicy sausage, sunny side eggs, and arugula) and it was really good. Their woodoven pizzas have always been my go to, love the thin crust and all the different toppings.
Hosted a bridal shower last weekend in the private banquet room downstairs for 21 women.   It was awesome.  Food was great - service was impeccable.  Tony and Nate were both great to work with and the bride couldn't have been happier. It's a special place.
Nope, not buying it... Non japanese sushi joint with large screen tv playing hip hop music video... Why???? Nice interior though. I usually don't like to give negative reviews... but this wasn't my place (sorry).
We just saw The Decemberists here and it was one of the best shows I have ever been to. Aside from the fact that this is my favorite band, the venue itself was fantastic. Not too big, not too small and great customer service.The acoustics were phenomenal. It is easy to find and parking is free if you find a spot in one of the nearby neighborhoods. Here's to hoping that another great band will soon perform here!
This is a chain burger place, but they do make the burgers fresh and let you dress them yourself.  Granted, this same scenario plays out a thousand times better at The Chuck Box in Tempe, however,  The Chuck Box lacks one thing...a nacho cheese pump!  Oh, glorious plastic cheese that you can pump on your fries to your heart's desire.  Heck, pump it on to your burger if you want!    

Three stars for the burgers and one star for the vat of cheese.
Date & Time: Wednesday 3\/3\/15 @ 1:30pm

I've wanted to try a new ramen place, since Monta is always packed and has wait times over 45mins. I found this place with the help of some yelpers. I decided I can't go wrong with a place that offers ramen and appetizers.

I ordered:
- Takoyaki
- Tonkatsu
- 1 Soyu Ramen (garlic chips and extra chasiu)
- 1 Tonkatsu Ramen (extra chasiu and corn)
- 3 Calpico drinks
- 1 Sprite
total about $40

Since i've only tried Monta and (my moms ramen), I'll be comparing the two (mom already wins). 

I LOVE takoyaki and this place makes it so good, it's crisp on the outside and nice and creamy on the inside. The tonkatsu made with a cabbage salad and the tonkatsu sauce on the side, which was cooked to perfection. The tonkatsu was thick and crispy on the outside with the tender juicy pork on the inside. It was delicious.

When the ramen arrived the noodles were perfect, the soup was super flavorful and didn't need to add additional salt or soy sauce to it. Compared to monta's chasiu, this one is meaty in the middle and melt in your mouth on the sides (which is how it's suppose to be). I didn't enjoy the chasiu at Monta because it was like eating boiled fat (it was slippery, melty, and gooey). 

If you want incredible ramen, come here. The waitress was super friendly and helpful. This small ramen restaurant should be deemed the best. The best thing is, it didn't make my love sick, he got so sick at Monta, he was scared to try Ramen again.
- Fantastic food!
- Horrible service (worst I have ever had)
- Ambivalent management and staff

SUMMARY: Lovely restaurant and great food. The service and management show no concern for their customers or their reputation. Ambivalence doesn't begin to describe the lack of customer focus at this very expensive restaurant. This is a warning. Find another nice restaurant choice.

The Setting: 8 adults, 40th birthday celebration, 7:45 PM, Saturday night, reservation. Restaurant was about half full (odd on a Saturday night - may be a sign of decline)

The Food: The plates, from start to finish, were full of flavor, perfectly prepared, and well presented. Not really worth the price as nearby competing restaurants offer better value but definitely a treat. Everyone liked their entrees, especially the one remaining plate of venison (apparently what was available was not worth serving they said. Odd!). Drinks were good and imaginative.

The Service: Colossally incompetent would not sum it up sufficiently. From the start, at the small bar, of which it was just our party, we had to hail the bartender to get service even as we were the only ones standing there. At the table we were greeted relatively promptly and the menu explained. The "snacks" would come more or less immediately and would hold us over until appetizers came out. So we ordered two "snacks" and one appetizer.  - - - - Twenty-two minutes later, after we had finished a bottle of wine and several water glasses were empty for some time, we got up and found the waiter to ask where they were. He said "two minutes more". Eight minutes later (now a full 30 minutes) our immediate "snacks" arrived. The appetizer came 5 minutes later (now 35 minutes! - that was the only plate taken from the bill). They were good. Water glasses filled again. NOT A WORD was said in apology or acknowledgement. Now, after nearly 40 minutes, we actually ordered our entrees. WTF!? 

We have seen the waiter maybe twice and the manager once as he told us (15 minutes after we ordered) that only one venison plate was worthy of serving. Order something else.

Here we are, seated about about 8pm. At 9:25 the entrees arrived. They were fabulous. One of our party had to get his in a "to go bag" as he had not planned on a two hour dinner. None of us had.

End Result: While the manager did bring a plate of lovely truffles for the birthday girl (thank you) not a word, no apology, no mention whatsoever of the tremendously poor service and ridiculously long wait times (and again, the restaurant was full of empty tables). Nothing but the one appetizer was provided in compensation. The manager never even came to apologize and address the concerns that we voiced, relatively politely at first, throughout the "ordeal".
Simply scrumptious; would have given 4.5 stars, if possible.  We enjoyed dinner on the patio (although flies were very annoying).  Perfect filet & scallops (and I'm picky!).  Recommend reservations.
Meh. Skip this place. The service was so apathetic. I just needed to buy a few sheets of paper from the copy center. The guy behind the counter really couldn't care less about helping me. Supposedly they were out of the paper I was looking for and he just shrugged his shoulders at me. I will not be returning to this location in the future and I would recommend taking your business elsewhere.
Historic landmark and part of Nevada's history, one should stray away from the tourist places and go back in time and saunter around the historic landmarks of Las Vegas Nevada.  A friend back home sent me her daughter's Flat Stanley project- he's the cutie in the picture outside El Cortez ;)  El Cortez was one of the numbers places on the Historic Registry I showed Flat Stanley.  I educated my friend's daughter and her class about the history of Las Vegas!
I'm so disappointed, this was the place to go for Lao food. Another lady with very short hair cooked our food today and it was so bland and oily. I drove from Southern Highlands and don't think I'll be back.

I ordered:
Beef lad nah- had hair in it and beef was pink, not sure if that's good to eat
Nam - so much ginger that it's all you taste
Khao pik - no taste
Phad Thai chicken was slimey
Papaya salad- just not the same as it used to be
Basil chicken with egg- picture had two eggs, mine came with one. It tasted like boiled ground chicken. That's it, not salty, nothing just watered down chicken.
Beef jerky- which came out straight from the microwave. Was actually heated twice. 
Green Chicken Curry- flavor was good, eggplants were super old and hard, literally bits of chicken. Lots of bones


Super sad that the owner is no longer cooking. I'll just go to the Lao Asian Store on Desert Inn and Mohave. 

I gave it two stars because the owner was still there and still very nice. But she needs to cook the food. Her food was great and the reason I kept coming back.
This is a very well maintained course. Beautiful scenery and a great layout. Unfortunately I seen every end of the course today. I hit the ball all over the place, so I came to appreciate the excellent job the grounds keepers doing with the landscaping...lol.

The is an outstanding golf course and it is located in a beautiful setting. Red Rock Country Club reminds me of some of the nicer courses down in Boca Raton. Great place to golf!!
I called Doggie District Pet Resort to ask how things work, since this is the first time we will ever be putting our puppy in a resort. I was a little worried (okay super worried). The lady who answered the phone was super nice and she answered all of my questions.

We decided to give this place a try. We scheduled a behavior test to see how she does with the staff, other pets and the area (a requirement). It went well. The staff seemed very friendly. They had an indoor and outdoor play area. I also like that they separate the bigger dogs from the small to medium size dogs. 

A few weeks ago we had to board our puppy overnight for 3 days. It has been a very long time since our puppy has been without us, so I was worried (like always). But I was very pleased when I got an email from Doggie District- the staff took pictures of our puppy and emailed them to me to see how she was doing. When we picked up our puppy she was very smelly and dirty, but what do you expect, she has been playing all day. 

Overall, we are very happy with this place. Weather we decide to do day care or overnight boarding we will be using Doggie District Pet Resort again.
Started trying to reach men's dept at 8pm. I stopped trying at 8:39pm. After no answer in several depts I was connected to an operator. She tried for 10min to reach someone and then said that she even tried to reach management and she could not get them on the phone. Good thing that wasn't some tragedy taking place.
Store manager Omassis Burress needs to get his sh*t together.
Le poulet est bien aprété . Pas piquant , mais le gont est très bon.  Bon nouveau restaurant .
Love, love, love and adore this place and staff!
Accommodating staff, one issue why can't they open before 111am please (insert begging emoji)
Rose Garden with lychee is my favorite.  Well, at least until one of the knowledgeable ladies suggests another combo;)
As a Scottsdale transplant living in Chandler,  I'm always looking for a "cool" and "hip" place to go for happy hour.  Normally, the boys pick places like Majerle's and Murphy's Law.  Boorrrring.  

Now, I don't really like Sandbar Scottsdale.  Too......"alternative", with lots of punk rockers.  But anyway.

We arrived around 4:30pm for happy hour, and there was already a good sized crowd there.  When we sat down with several others, it was clear the waitress was terribly slow with zero personality.  And what's up with the black knee socks with the sculls?  It continued to get busy, and the crowd was the most random group ever.  I saw 21 year olds, parents with children in tow, hot MILF's, and old dorky men straight from Intel.  I'm thinking it's because it's new and everyone wants to check out that cool bar with the real sand and mini pool.

I would have gone with 2 stars, but I threw an extra in because they're new and I will check it out on a Saturday night around 9pm to see if we can weed out some of the randoms and get a fun crowd having a good time!  

Who am I kidding?  We just talk amongst ourselves anyway!
Consistently good quality food. I can feed 6 people for under $35. However, teens manning the registers can create hiccups when they are socially awkward.  So, no four stars here.
Great view of Las Vegas, right from the Strip!  And, it pays to be a local - it's literally half-price, I think.  The ride is a half hour long, but it flew by for me.  I enjoyed every second of it!  And, if you get on there late night, you might even get a whole cabin to yourself...
Maggie Oakes is a restaurant nestled in the new trendy hotel William Gray in the Old Port. The space is simply spectacular- bright colourful furniture mixed with marble and gold accents turned this former food court (sorry, Valentine's has left the building) into a modern yet cozy space. Fresh micro herbs adorn an entire wall close to the cold room and wine cellar. It's evident much care, thought and money have gone into creating Maggie Oakes.

We were excited to try the food, hoping it'd be as delicious as the restaurant was visually pleasant. For starters, we tried the sweet potato soup, house-made Terrine and apple cider vinaigrette salad. They tasted good but nothing special. For our mains, we shared the lamb ragout cavatelli and half-roasted chicken. The sauce in the pasta dish was deep in flavour and the meat so tender! The chef even added some okra which gave some needed texture to the plate. The chicken held its own and was well-seasoned. 

We were pretty happy with the food at this point. But the desserts were the highlight. We tried the Paris Brest, Yuzu tart and chocolate fondant. The shortbread tart crust was perfectly buttery and crunchy. The thin layer of rich chocolate ganache provided a nice balance to the acidic lemon flavour. I'd come back post-dinner just for that tart. And maybe a glass of wine.

Beyond the food, the service was excellent and would have deserved 5 stars on its own. 

My only tiny criticism would be that the cocktails were not as good as the rest of the meal. I had the Mai Tai Coco which tasted like a bland mix of ice and alcohol with a hint of coco. Next time I'll stick to wine.
I went here twice first time we ordered max's chicken which was good, kare kare- all soup no meat and bland, palabok- also bland, calamari -its fried so it was good and garlic fried rice- ok. Not the best food I've had and thought I should try it again, maybe itll be better. Tried for the second time, ordered sinigang, sisig, max chicken. Well it was all terrible except for the chicken. Sisig was soggy, sinigang was tasteless. The service as usually in this place was horrible and very rude. People here are not accommodating and act oblivious to everything wrong with the place.
I was lucky enough to get the opportunity to come here for a business lunch, and well let's say my work rate declined in the afternoon with a belly full of such delicious food!

It's the fine dining posh sister of the famous Kushi's restaurant. We arrived and the atmosphere is tranquil and calm, a morning rushing around was soon forgotten as the ambiance worked it's magic on me.

We plumped for the taster menu and started with an unusual chicken salad wrapped in lettuce leaves with grated testy green apple on top. This set the scene for an amazing menu of tasty, unique indian dishes. Having lived in Singapore for two years I've been spoilt with some fantastic Indian dining experiences. But this has to be said was the most unique, flavorful taste sensation I've had.

As it was a business lunch we didn't try the wine selection which looked good, but we did try some of the mocktails which really stood out. I had a watermelon and fresh ginger mix which really went well together and perfectly balanced the food.

The service was really friendly and we had some amusing banter, without it being over the top. 

I would very, very highly recommend this if you're looking for somewhere different at that end of town. They also have a newly opened bar area which is a nice laid back area to enjoy a refreshment or two. I'll definitely be back for more than one visit.
Make sure you signup for their email list, you'll get 20-30% off coupons each week, then it makes going here a great deal for name brand clothing.
Nothing too special here. It can hit the spot if you are starving, but it's not memorable enough to make the treck to this busy corner of Valley View and SMR. There are plenty of options in town for a gyro plate with rice that equal or exceed this offering.
Definitely one of my favorite shows so far in Vegas!  If you haven't seen this show in a while, then come back and check it out - apparently it changes pretty frequently, so it can be a fresh experience if you see it from time to time.  I was expecting to have a good time, but if you let yourself get caught up in it, you'll be like me and have an absolute blast!  There's plenty of audience participation stuff, which only adds to the fun of the experience.  Can't wait to come back and see them again!
If West Liberty Avenue became more developed, I think this place would stay around.  Very good food and service.  Good beer
I can't believe Mike O. has 111 check ins at Hana. Not only does he have the dukedom!  Hana should have a chair with his name on it. Wow!  I seriously cannot claim having been to any one restaurant over 100 times!
So this place must be good if Mike O. Is such a loyal, regular costumer. He must roll out of bed and saunter right into Hana!
Oh wait, this review is suppose to be about MY experience at Hana. Well, I have to concur with Mike O. This place serves some darn good food. Not just sushi, the cooked varieties too. 
I've always liked eating here. Sushi is fresh, cooked items full of flavor. 
I don't always check-in when I eat here but doesn't matter, I don't think anyone is about to take the dukedom away from Mike O. !
I've been here once and I loved it, twice like it it's kinda weird they do really hard for my back and legs but when they stretch your and hands you barely feel a thing, so yeah whatever the 3rd visit made me feel like wtf happened lol so my bf and I came and we decided to get a massage after the gym, I got an appointment at 9pm they took us in and usually they put hot bag for you to lay on, there's none and that's one of things I look forward on, I usually get the girls but this time I got a guy who is really skinny, but I didn't mind coz I really didn't care but for some reason I like the ladies more coz of I got the most sloppiest foot massage ever! And I usually love Em he mostly likely missed the spot smh then even my hand too was sloppy, my head massage idk the only thing I liked was my arm but everytime I said it hurts I guess he thinks it's funny that's kinda rude even the girl whose doing my bf massage like wtheck, they keep talking and they take forever to get the stuff like warm towel really???! I should've check the time they got done they probly cheated smh or something but I guess it's either not to get him anymore or find somewhere better.
I'm an avid DD fan but this location makes me sad. The service is always crap. They never, ever remember my straw and the sandwiches are half cold. They've screwed up my simple coffee order so frequently that I've switched to just the carrick location. Also, sorry to count this against them, but the spot on 51 is awful to get in and out of.
I am a regular customer of Einstein Bagels and this was my first visit to the Val Vista location. The place was absolutely filthy- there were bagels on the floor behind the counter, crumbs everywhere, the ceiling was yellow and had huge water spots, the utensils they were using to make the drinks were just lying on dirty countertops, the food line looked like it needed to be scrubbed...

Anyways, I order my usual Nova Lox (no red onion and capers). They were very understaffed so the line moved really slow and the lady at the cash register to pay was also swamped with all the drink orders. After 10 minutes or so, I hear my name called for my food and they made it with red onion and capers. I told them I ordered it without that and the guy re-made it. No apology, just grabbed the bag and re-made it. 

I honestly would never come back to this location- it was the worst I've ever seen
Monastery isn't your typical bakery and deli - it must suffer from the Napoleon syndrome because it's massive! Much larger than any typical bakery and deli has a right to be. It's actually closer to a small local market. 

With pastries, snacks and a coffee bar on one side of the super-bakery-deli, a hot table on the other which serves up some pretty awesome fried chicken (about a buck a piece), a large fresh bread and cake selection at the back and a huge assortment of cheeses and deli meats in the middle, this place is a huge hit will Oakvillians. 

The banana bread ($8) is superb, and the coffee cake ($9) is pretty darn good as well. 

Cookies ($1.50) are ok, nothing special. I'd pass on the somosas ($1.25 each) as well.
I bought a bike here last month and I can't recommend this shop enough.  Alex helped me pick out the perfect bike for what I needed and the price was really good.  I bought a used bike which had been resorted to excellent condition and is running beautifully.
Entered the restaurant around 8PM on a Friday..not terribly busy...we were seated right away..Greeted by a friendly hostess and as soon as we were seated  a very efficient and friendly waiter..."'Andrew". 
We ordered the Fried green Tomatoes with goat cheese and onion relish to start..it came quickly and was fresh fried ,,short on the goat cheese ..three little scoops on four tomatoes, but very good. 
Next I ordered the appetizer Lamb Sliders and Portebello Fries for my entree and my husband ordered the REALLY Burger with Mac and Cheese side for his entree.
Our waiter  "Andrew", was very efficient in filling our water and taking care of our plates.
My Lamb sliders were very short on the meat (barely a tbls of Lamb on each one} and way too sweet...the Portebello Fries I had to send back..they burned my mouth from the salt in the batter...and I adore salty things...
My husbands Really Burger with a fried egg, bacon, tomato, and fresh horsereadish sauce was good. 
It is a very brightly lit restaurant..looks like it was a self service place before..they will have to step up on the recipes and darken it up a bit to appeal to the late night crowd..they are open 24 hours on Fri and Sat...
I don't think we will go back...nope ,...not REALLY.....
I really wish more sub joints offered a Medium size (a la Quiznos) because a 6" just wasn't enough to fill me up. 

It is as others have mentioned, very "Mr. Sub" but on a much higher level of quality. The bread and cheese are the only items that are similar, the bacon truly is the best in it's field. Every other sandwich spot has typical microwave bacon that offers no texture once in the sammy. Here they have somehow managed to pre-cook crispy bacon and maintain it's crunch after nuking. 

I'll be back, typically when I'm not super hungry (doesn't happen that often though).
BLEH. That's really all to say about Someburros. 

The only reason I came to this place was because of an unused gift card that I had for over a year. I ordered a common Mexican food item: a carne asada burrito. 

The steak was bland, the salsa was okay. I think the only good thing about this place was the chips. 

Save your time and money and take your business elsewhere. This is a very mediocre Mexican food restaurant that I am not even sure how it stays in business.
I've eaten at this place many times. Because it's so close to the Las Vegas strip this location is always packed. It doesn't matter if you're going inside or using the drive through plan on a wait.

Also keep in mind that this isn't the best of neighborhoods.
This one goes out to my former colleagues at the Fringe Society!

I have been going on about this shop for no short period of time; every time I have ever bimbled past, I have gazed longingly at their pretty, pretty dresses - every dress the kind that seems to fit and flatter - cleavage-flaunting, waist-cinching, cute'n'girly dresses with plenty of fabric in the skirt.

So when I left my job at the Fringe Society to join the wonderful world of Yelp, my super-perceptive colleagues presented me (among other things) with a voucher for Cookie. Bless you, Fringers. Bless you.

What with one thing and another, though, it's taken me until now to actually redeem it. (One thing being accidentally leaving it in Yorkshire; another being not having time to shop; a final being that on four - count them - FOUR separate occasions I have gone all the way there only to realise I've left the voucher at home)

BUT AT LAST, THIS WAS THE WEEK.

What can I say? The dresses aren't cheap - most of them come in around the £70 mark - but they're good-quality, fully-lined, well-fitting and made in nice, soft fabrics. There's also a heck of a range in here. I tried on a good few dresses, and sadly the one I liked best, a bright red one with little white dots, wasn't available in a 10, but its navy blue equivalent was and so KABOOM. I am kitted out for my trip to San Francisco. Look out, California, Polka-Dot Cressi is coming, and she's got a damn fine dress. Thank you, Fringe-folk. I am a the happiest spotted CM you ever did see.
**Dinner - reservation is a must. I came here on a weekday before and restaurant was packed. Their dinner menu change quite often based on seasons. They also have a whole-animal dinner which I really wanna try! Overall service is not that good. Servers aren't friendly and they will rush you, especially during brunch. For dinner I had the following: 

-bison flank $18: The taste was very similar to beef and it did not taste gamey. There was quite a bit of heat which I think came from the smoke harissa and the black garlic added a hint of sweetness, which paired well with the bison.

-scallops $18: the scallops had a nice golden brown crust and had a tender, springy center. I liked the slightly sweet quince BBQ sauce which accentuated the earthiness flavor of the hazelnut and did not overwhelmed the natural taste of the juicy scallops.

**Brunch - no reservation and come early! Restaurant is really small and get filled up quickly. 
 Also, get the DONUTS if they are still available. I hate dessert and Rachelle's donut was probably the best I have had so far! Not too sweet with a nice texture :). For brunch I had the followings: 

-poutine $12: The light and fluffy yet chewy potato gnocchi was covered in a delectable gravy and pulled pork. You really can't go wrong adding a melting cheese curds to an already great dish, and I love how the curds still maintained its squeakiness and volume.

-huevos rancheros $14: There's nothing like a runny golden fried egg, tomato sauce packed with flavors, and fresh corn tortillas to start my morning. It would have been better if they didn't skimp on the avocados, because you know, who doesn't love to bite into big creamy chunks of avocado!

-crispy pork hocks $14: The pork hocks had a super crispy skin yet when you bite into them, these were incredibly soft and tender. Love how the chef balanced out the fatty pork hocks with a mildly spicy and sour kimchi. Salad wasn't drenched in dressings but potato is not consistent, can be overdone sometimes. 

-the bruce leroy $14: Golden brown crispy skin and perfectly cooked chicken thigh. The biscuit was quite dry. I actually found the sweet soy sauce to be overpowering and the sandwich became incredibly salty after a few bite
This review is mainly for the pool only.

Love that it has a nice indoor salt water pool for the doggies to use. It is small, and only meant for 1 dog at a time. I have a small little one that makes this size work well for him, but not sure how the bigger dogs can really swim in here.

The pool is great as the water is lukewarm so my little guy is willing to go in (as we have been to another indoor pool which the water is cold).

For the 1st time users, they have an instructor there to help assess what your dog can do or not do, that way you don't scared them off from swimming.

After that, you are free to book time for just you and your pup.

And they have a tub outside of the pool to bath them when they are done.

Overall, no complaints with them!
After having a pampering day, I feel compelled to update my review to include the new awesome I have experienced. 

In addition to brow waxing, Danielle's facials are amazing. I recently came back from a 4 month trip that was camping for the most part and she did wonders to help revitalize my face and take away any damage the setting had done. She asked me questions to help determine what the best procedure was for me and made the entire session relaxing and comfortable. This will certainly not be my last facial. 

Tiffany was very patient when it came to my return pedicure. After four months of hiking boots and socks ALL. THE. TIME. .. well except for the shower when I got to wear wonderful flip flops, my feet were a pure disaster zone. I will spare you the horrid detail. It was bad. I was actually a little embarrassed, even though I knew it was typical. I walked out of there a million times better! 

Finally, I came back surprised to find my stylist had left, and scheduled an appointment with Ashley, whom I was told would not be afraid of my sometimes interesting hair decisions. She was fantastic!! Rather than try to reign me in, she helped set me free and even showed me a natural vegan product line to help put the natural curl in my hair. Everything she did was pure magic and I would recommend her in a heartbeat. I am totally in love with my hair!
Creme brûlée cupcake: my reaction after consumption = How. Do. They. Do. It? 

It is so delicious I have to temper myself and make sure to only buy small quantities.

It's magic.
One of the better Greek restaurants in Markham. Great portions, prices and quality of food.  It is a casual restaurant with a good amount of seating and good service. We ordered the gyro Greek sandwich along with chicken souvlaki plate with salad and roasted potatoes. Both meats were juicy and everything was well seasoned.
I really enjoyed my breakfast burrito (I actually shared part if it, as it was a decent size), and the caramel flan was absolutely delicious.  The quality was naturally far higher than a fast food breakfast burrito from Sonic or McDonald's.  This abbreviated Fox concept is a great break from the Burger King and McDonald's airport food of my childhood!  

It also made me a little sad to see Modern Burger still around after the sad, partly self-inflicted demise of Modern Steak and it's Modern Burger window at Scottsdale Fashion Square.  Ah, memories.
I was meeting a couple of friends at a nearby brewery and this was the food truck they had here. I wanted the sweet pork dumplings, but unfortunately they did not have any left (but failed to erase it off the board...). 
I went with the pork and chive instead. 
The flavor was very good, but there was a little kick to it that I was not expecting. They are smaller dumplings than other places as well. I think they come with 10 dumplings, which was a decent size - although I could have eaten a few more or even split another with a friend.
Overall, I enjoyed the meal and I look forward to being able to try the sweet pork dumplings next time.
Was finally able to check off e from my list last weekend.  Securing reservations wasn't super difficult as we wanted to dine earlly (allowing me more time to gamble after dinner).  As others have mentioned, we received our golden tickets a few days prior to our scheduled time.  

Arrived promptly at 5:15 and was escorted to a communal table where a waiter will take your drink orders.  We had planned to bring our own wine but the shipment didn't make it in time from napa so we opted to try their sangria.  Oh they do charge a corkage fee of $50\/bottle so don't be shocked to see the corkage on the bill if you do bring a bottle.  

You are served a total of 20 courses which range anywhere from frozen sangria to wagyu steak.  The chef are super interactive and do an excellent job of describing each dish and loved being able to see them plate each before they were served.  After browsing some other yelp reviews, it appears that they only change a few dishes based on what's in season.  

All dishes were super tasty and the only dish I didn't enjoy was the raspberry jelly with goat milk cheese.  The meal was pricey but it definitely lived up to the hype and if you're in doubt of whether or not you can justify the price, just think this meal includes the food along with a one-of-a-kind show.
I had the opportunity to work with Steelcoast in creating the first web identity for a brand new organization.  The experience was terrific!  The Steelcoast team was helpful and collaborative and had many great suggestions for our site.  Our timeline was met and we went live with a site that "wowed" our Board of Directors.  Our web presence was transformed overnight.  Steelcoast also set us up with an easy to use content management system, so we can control our own destiny and easily make changes and improvements to the site.  However, when we have needed to make bigger enhancements beyond our skill set, Steelcoast has been there for us, such as adding an e-commerce component to the site.  Again, enhancements have been completed professionally and on a timely basis.  Finally, they don't mind when we call with minor questions or issues, as they are truly a customer-driven group of professionals.  I heartily recommend Steelcoast to anyone looking for a positive, collaborative experience coupled with exceptional creativity and strong technical expertise.
Professional, knowledgable, and organized. I highly recommend Allison Jung!  She helped me purchase a home, and the service I received was ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING!  She knows her business, thoroughly understands the buying process, and kept me informed every step of the way.  She accommodated me while I was living in CA and looking at homes in Las Vegas. Although her office is in Henderson, she willingly traveled without hesitation across town to the Northwest area several times to show me properties. She was always prompt in setting up viewing appointments, (which is important with how fast houses can move in this market). All around professional, always on time to showings, very informative, (it is clear she know the business well takes pride in her work). Although I'm sure she has many clients, she always made me a priority to was very responsive and prompt anytime I reached out to her with any questions or concerns.  Thank you Allison!
On a quick trip to Las Vegas on a whim we decided to have a nice bowl of pho. I Yelp the few restaurants and Pho T came up. What a pleasant surprise! We were greeted warmly and out food came quickly. My friend had the vegetarian pho.  I had the house special.  We shared their fried tofu.  All of it was fantastic! 

Only reason I'm giving this place four stars rather than five is because of the Muzak :-\/.  

So,  if you're in Las Vegas try this family run business, Pho T. Mmmmmmmm!
I've waffled back and forth between 4 and 5 stars, as I would honestly give them a 4.5.  However, since I liked it more than Ka, and that's a solid 4, they get a 5.

The cast were very charismatic on the stage.  The plot was interesting, and wrapped up nicely.

The music wasn't nostalgic to me, but my mother loved it.

The visual effect where they blast the stage lights at the audience to (spoiler alert?) create the illusion of the stage in reverse is cool, but definitely made me squint!

I don't really care about what's pre-recorded and what's not, but at one point the guy playing Frankie knocked a microphone with his fist and the mic was definitely live.

There was a slight issue with the box office not recognizing the buffet promo from ticket master (and the whole annoyance of having purchased tickets but still having to go to the box office to get the buffet passes), but they figured it out and we got our passes.

They did open the theater doors early enough for me to buy (an overpriced) bottle of water, but the basically required "pose for a photo" slows things down.

There's a few dumb jokes in the script that fell flat for me, but they were still nowhere near as bad as some of the awful clown antics at the Cirque shows.
We love coming here the food is always super tasty and the service is always fast and friendly. We especially were impressed by Tony. Such a great employee!!!
I have at attempted to go to this place 3 times so far and they are always closed. Don't know if they went out of business.
Okay fine, I'm addicted. Chalk another one up for the books. My first review perhaps was not fully thought out or the sticker shock might have rubbed me the wrong way. But mark my words, these bagels are worth $1.50 each (sans cream cheese schmear). I buy 6 and eat one on the way home. I slice the others in half and freeze 'em. I take one bagel out each morning and toast it, schmear it with butter, and voila!
This is a very good Cheesecake Factory. The service was exemplary but Heather was outstanding. Very attentive yet not overbearing. The food was very good. We had Calamari, Endive salad, Ahi Carpaccio. The perfect light dinner. We will be back!
I liked this place. It is very cute. But the music does not match, they play top hits which feels distracting. I want to be able to do work and study here because it looks so "chill" but the loud pop music makes it hard.
This place seems to take a beating in the ratings and I am not completely sure of why. It is an ok quick, casual place to grab some food. The service was quick and the person who took our order was very friendly. You order at the counter and then pickup a little further down.

I ordered an Italian Sausage and Poutine. The sausage and roll it came on were both solid. With a little mustard, I was happy with them. The poutine was fairly good. The fries comes topped with cheese curds, bacon and gravy. It is a good sized portion.

If you are looking for a casual place to get a quick, cheap meal this is an option.
Probably my favorite movie theater. Ok, well, aside from that one theater in Cleveland Hts. where you can buy booze. That's an AMAZING idea, btw.

Atlas Cinemas is clean, the employees are nice, it's a diverse crowd which is always great and it's small, which I love. 

Plus, and this is a HUGE plus here guys, every Monday is $5! I think it's for community thankfulness or customer appreciation day. I have no idea because it doesn't matter. It's FIVE dollars to see CURRENT movies!

It's kinda hidden (behind Micro Center) but once you locate it, it's worth the visit!
Great sandwiches at great prices! We had a party of 3 for an early dinner on Sunday.  Ordered the Montreal Smoked Meat, Corned Beef, and my personal favourite Rueben Sandwich.  The Platter comes with fries and coleslaw, or you can have the sandwich by itself.  They have a generous portion of fries, and an average appetizer size for the coleslaw with a pickle on top.  Out of the 3 sandwiches the Reuben is by far the most favourful and a much heavier\/filling sandwich, with saucraut, a slice of swiss cheese, and ranch dressing.  The meat in all 3 were tender as one should expect.  The Montreal Smoked Meat has the smokieness and ground pepper that you would expect.  The Corned Beef had less flavour, but if you want something that tastes less salty that might be the option for you.  All in all, the food was great and the service was nothing less than perfect.  The server was very attentive and came to check in on us a few times, and swiftly brought us everything that we asked for.  Looking forward to going back again!
This place is great.  Honestly just visited with friends from out-of-town as a lark.  

I'm allergic to cats and take medication, but I was concerned that an hour inside the upstairs cat loft would stretch pharmaceutical science and my lungs to their limits.  It did not.  I found the loft to be immaculately clean...precious little cat hair migrated to the furnishings, no smell, no messes...just a bunch of EXTREMELY docile well-groomed kitties.  

Unlike Dobby, my cat (I hope you're reading this, Dobby), they were all extremely accepting of petting and cuddles and did not tear ass all over the room destroying my furniture for no apparent reason.  They seemed very at home in the loft and cavorted happily in and amongst the cat castles strategically interspersed among the more people-suited couches and chairs.  

You guys...they serve liquor.  I ordered their version of a French 75 (some cat-related name derivation or other) and it was delicious.  

One complaint, and it is minor, is that it wasn't immediately apparent who actually worked there.  She had a laptop and I honestly thought she was just some young lady enjoying a stress-easing change of work (or study) venue, sitting on one of the couches, absently petting a cat.  Once I realized she worked their, she happily and readily parted with the laptop, took my order and disappeared downstairs to fill it.  

Service upstairs is necessarily slow.  One waitress per 10 people (they limit the loft to 10 at a time) and a trip downstairs then up.  Service downstairs I didn't experience, having arrived a bit late and escorting my friends immediately upstairs for our reservation.

I'd return.  I'd order a drink five or so minutes before my reservation, take it up and then order another after I got there if the spirit moved me.  Just more convenient that way.  Definitely worth a visit with a cat lover.  Reservations required for the cat loft.
My friend wanted to meet me here and I am so glad because I never would have heard of this place or come here. I don't live in this area of the valley but it was such a cool spot, especially with the surrounding outdoor spaces for kids to explore, and Agritopia and Joe's Farm Grill to checkout. 

Order your food at the counter, take a number and find a table either inside in one of two small rooms or outdoor on their patio. The indoor dining areas are smaller and don't have a ton of seating. I would imagine it gets pretty busy when the weather cools down, especially on the weekends. I can't imagine there are a ton of places like this in Gilbert and it seems like it would appeal to a younger, more hip crowd. 

I tried the San Diegan and it was absolutely delicious. It was an open faced omelet with all fresh ingredients. I would definitely order it again. My friend swears by the burritos and loved hers. Coffee was pretty good but I'd have to try another to really comment on the quality because I was starving and more focused on the food. Boston cream pie was ok but I don't think I'm a huge fan of Boston cream pies in general. To be honest, I'm not even really sure why I ordered it. Next time I'm going to have to try one of their famous, award winning cupcakes! I had no idea that's what they were known for! 

I'm sure this place is making Gilbert more hip and trendy. I'd return and checkout some of the surrounding spots too.
Thai iced tea with condensed milk and boba. Perfection. I love the flaky soft texture of the snoh ice. I want to make sticky snow angels in a vat of it. Be bold. Get red bean or taro. Avoid the boring strawberry.
I once again feel the need to sing my praises for Luci's. And more specifically, the weekday morning crew. At some point I bought myself the best supplies to make myself a morning coffee for the road. And sometime a few days ago, I realized that was a damn waste of money. Because I was only going to end up at Luci's. Luci's is where I can go to get a nice dose of sunshine, both weather wise and people wise. Luci's is where I can go and make up my morning song about hot coffee, and rather than have the staff look at me funny, they freestyle right along with me. Luci's is where the name field on the order sticker doesn't say name, but rather says neighbor. Luci's is where I can get breakfast for breakfast, lunch and dinner. And weekday morning Luci's is nice and calm and quiet, which allows me to start the day at my own pace.
The TeePee is good, greasy, satisfying mexican food.  The place is small, the booths are uncomfortable, and the wait can be long, but it is worth it.  my favorite is the lunch special, chicken burro with green or red sauce, rice and beans.  they also recently started serving vegetarian beans for all of you veggies out there.
Some say I'm nasty... I really don't care. That's my PER-OGATIVE"

Mission Accomplished.
There's a male entertainment section upstairs! The male dancers were all black, FYI. 
There was a cover to get in, but ladies are free to get in to see ladies.
Fully nekkid, completely entertaining with skits and everything. Apparently the women who came to watch were really fun - the music was all hip hop - really good, the ladies were out of their seats to dance, in between acts. 
And although its nude, they do not stick it in your face or anything. I wasnt sure if touching was allowed. I have never seen women make it rain until I saw the bills fly here. I'm personally more of a work for your $ type person.

One of the dancers and an audience girl gave my strip club virgin friends a hard time because they bought me a dance when there was someone on stage and they were discussing who to pick for me... because they couldn't figure out how lap dances work here -  mightve come off rude, but they just didnt know - everyone else was really nice. Security walked us to our car - I guess so we wouldnt get harassed in case anyone thought we were dancers.

Its far from the strip - but less "woooooooo" and screaming-bachelorette types, a plus after the other entertainment. Wash your hands before you leave and bring hand santizer for the car - but thats with all strip clubs. There. I Yelped it. I admit I went - its not for everyone, but it was fun!
I met the owner of Studio Charme, Karla Lambart, when she was my first ever makeup artist for my first ever photo shoot.  I did not go to her studio, I met her at my photographer's studio.

I showed up that day tired and nervous being that it was my first ever photo shoot. You know the feeling, blah and unsure.

That day she was, I think, at least an hour late (I've since forgotten the reason) which was okay with me since I had blocked out the whole day not knowing what to expect and the photographer and I spent the time shooting the breeze.

When she showed up, my eyes registered completed shock because she was absolutely gorgeous!  She was dressed very casually but that couldn't hide the fact that she had the perfect body and facial bone structure.  I looked at her then I looked at myself in the mirror and I blurted out, "why are you a makeup artist and not a model?"

Yup.  No lie.  I did.  She simply told me makeup and hair was her passion.

With that, she started working on my hair and doing my makeup.  And I watched myself getting transformed.  I have had my hair and makeup done before.  Mostly for weddings and big events out and most of the time, I would say the results were satisfying, not stellar.  

With her quick hands, I watched my tiredness go away and my face transformed with her applying just the right amount of this and that here and there.  Nothing overdone and just the right amount.  As she styled my hair and I saw my limp hair taking on new life and styled, I became excited cause I know I was going to look fabulous and it was going to be a good photo shoot.  

As we chatted away, she would explain what she was doing and there were so many subtleties that she was applying to my face to make it look good for the camera.  She made everything look easy.

By the time we were done and I walked out, the photographer was ready to shoot!    She stayed with me through the whole shoot, changing my hair style to fit the outfit, changing the color of the lip stick. 

My most memorable moment was as she knew the photographer well, toward the end of the shoot, she jumped in too and we started to shoot together.  As it turns out, and as she should, she does do some promo work and modeling work on the side!
 
We ended up getting some great photos that morning!

I lament that her studio in way down in Chandler~ if her studio was anywhere close to where I lived, she would definitely be my stylist of choice and for surrrreeee I would take how to apply makeup lessons from her!!!!
5\/11\/15 update - I wanted Mrs. C and Baby C to experience Cili, so it was our last meal before heading home.  The patio was really nice & the shrimp cocktail is not to be missed!  The whole chilled shrimp hanging off a wine glass with cocktail sauce in the glass has been done to death.  Cili's version is DELICIOUS with the shrimp sitting on a bed of chilled sushi rice, and it is straight up amazing.  Get this appetizer & thank me later.
__________________________________________

On my way in from Los Angeles, I needed a quick lunch & didn't have time to stop anywhere else.  I really enjoyed my lunch at Cili, but maybe that's because it was the one time out of the year where I guessed correctly on what would be delicious on the menu.

First of the all, the prices at Cili are extremely reasonable.  Most salads & sandwiches are in the $12-$15 range, and I don't think anything on the menu was over $25.  I thought it might be more expensive, given the cost of the golf here, but that was not the case.  I ordered a Mediterranean salad & satay skewers, & both were excellent!  The satay skewers were a mix of beef & chicken, elegantly presented on a cut pineapple with a few vegetables thrown in.  It also came with 2 sauces & I couldn't make up my mind which one tasted better, because both were so dang good.  One was a red curry sauce, and one was a ginger\/soy sauce.  Just cut your meat in half & try both.  You can't go wrong.

The Mediterranean salad was also good with a nice mix of greens, feta cheese, olives, tomatoes, etc.  But the one thing that I thought was particularly clever was that the croutons were toasted pieces of pita bread.  Why haven't I seen this in other greek salads?  It's such a great idea!

Four stars for good service & good food that doesn't break the bank.
I love this place!  When I came here last week for the first time, I so enjoyed seeing all the animals there.  I was in a hurry, though, so I look forward to coming back and enjoying spending more time asking the workers there about the animals, as well as feeding the giraffe - maybe even having it paint for me!  (Yes, for a small fee, you can feed the giraffe, and pick paint colors for him to use on a canvas you hold and get to keep as a souvenir.)  Fun fact: I did learn on my short trip that some of the lions here are rescues, but many are direct descendants of the original, famous MGM lions.

Definitely recommended as a place to visit, whether you're a local or a tourist!
I wish I could say I stumbled upon this place on ASU's campus but the truth is, I saw a coworker holding a crepe that looked amazing, stopped her in the hallway, asked where she got it...and then proceeded to hunt for the location. This place is a little hard to find because it's tucked away between a few buildings. I'm new to campus but I believe it's on Tyler Mall near the McAllister Mall intersection, near the ISTB (Intrdiscip, Sc & Tech) building. It's a small little cart\/food truck set up and easy to miss. I walked right past it numerous times and never even noticed it. 

This place is owned by Delice Bistro, one of my favorite bakeries in Tempe. The plain sugar crepe was made fresh, warm, and delicious. The crepe itself was a little thicker than I'm used to but it also may have seemed that way because of the way it was folded into a triangle and wrapped in a to-go carrier. Because they wrap it up, you can devour it while walking across campus. Maybe all the campus walking evens out the calories...probably not but still worth it.  

The very fact that ASU had a crepe stand makes it FANCY. I was lucky to find a decent sandwich or slice of pizza at my college. If you fancy and on ASU's campus check out this spot.
We were extremely disappointed with our visit. The place looks like it was styled for the late 80's, but we tried to look past that since we were pretty hungry. 
While the service was alright, the kitchen seemed to have hit a snag and we waited for our food for 30-45 minutes. All the tables around us all seemed to have to same issue.
The food was bland and heavy in onions and peppers. Rice was the typical bland rice with peas, not very fresh or noteworthy. I had the carnitas tacos and my husband had a chimichanga. We both left feeling disappointed and wishing it was so much more. 
We didn't get a chance to check out any margaritas, but wish we did since the water tasted funny... Almost moldy? 
Glad we checked out the local place, but disappointed it wasn't better.
This place used to be the Notorious P.I.G. now it's called Hammered Hog BBQ Hall & Saloon and it's still owned by the same owner.  

Had a Snag and Save e-gift certificate from when the place was still called the Notorious P.I.G.

By the time I was ready to use the e-gift certificate, SnagandSave.com was bought out by Buywithme.com and my SnagandSave purchases disappeared.

Luckily, I had print out the receipt and even though I did not have the actual e-gift certificate, the owner (who could have not honored the e-gift certificate 1. because I did not have the actual e-gift certificate 2. because the place was now called Hammered Hog BBQ Hall & Saloon, a completely different restaurant) honored my receipt and give me $30 worth of tasty bbq.

How coooooooolllllllll is that!?  An owner with a sense of integrity!!  I really hope this restaurant becomes a success just because the owner is so righteous.

Plus, the bbq was tasty too!
Had a frosted sugar cookie from here.  It was definitely a step above those mass-produced pink frosted sprinkle-laden ones, but it didn't blow me away.  I personally feel the frosting (which almost seemed like fondant?) was way too thick.

So, one star off for too much frosting and another star off for the location, which others have already talked about.  I'm assuming they own the building...
C'est agrėable de chanter dans des salles privées   cela nous évite de nous gêner pour chanter.Chaque personne dois  payer 10$ .Dommage il n'y avait pas de prix  de groupe.  Chaque membre du groupe  a droit à une boisson non - alcoolisé gratuite . Quant  aux chansons ce n'est pas assez diversifié. Le système de karoke  boguait dans cerrtain choix de  chansons  .
This is a very good burger joint. I am always concerned when trying out places that are over hyped. While I do not believe it is the best burger, it is certainly worth the trip.

There was a long line. It did move at a good pace though. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My food was out in no time.

I ordered the ShackBurger and Cheese Fries. The burger comes topped with cheese, lettuce and ShackSauce. I opted for no tomato. The burger was juicy and tasty. The bun was solid as well. The sauce is a nice complimentary flavor. The single is more than enough burger.

The cheese fries come topped with a mix American and cheddar cheese as a sauce. The fries are good. The cheese was very good.

I was quite happy with both the fries and the burger. New Yorkers may over hype this somewhat, but it is still a very good burger.
Worst service ever. Plain and simple. Also, you guys aren't located in NY. Your prices are not calibrated right for the quality of food, size of portions, and service. Figure it out. I'm also pissed because I ordered food, picked it up and left, and they forgot my dessert. I went back and picked it up and though there would've been an apology of some sort or maybe even adding an extra Cannoli but no. Not going there again.
Unassuming bar and eatery with a sportsbar attitude.
Excellent beer selection. Food was decently priced and above average. Great place to bring the folks from out of town.
Excellent!!!  Great atmosphere and service is top notch.  If you order nothing, you MUST get the beef carpaccio. It is a dreamy dish that serves many.  Beef sliced paper thin, amazing fresh greens and a polenta puff hold this plate of decadence.  This dish  is worth a trip to vegas. 

Flatbread pizza is very tasty.  Prepared thin with just the right amount of everything on top.  Pasta dish with amaretto cookies is decadent and another must.  

I'll be back ;)
I came here during lunch time for the first time where it's located at the epicenter. 

It has a nice atmosphere with the outside patio and TVs located everywhere throughout. The service started off good but went down here from there. I only ordered three tacos but it took nearly 20 min to receive my food. When I finally received my food, it wasn't as great as the pictures make them look. In my humble opinion, they were lacking in flavor. Overall, my experience here was just Ok.
Does anyone remember when Mill Avenue used to be a fun place to hang out? Yeah, neither do I, but I've been told from the horse's mouth (sorry to call you a horse, Mr. Man) that it used to be a hip and happening place with plenty of small, custom shops and dives instead of the now ubiquitous mega-corporate whorebaggery. Luckily, you have only to travel a little bit further west on University to steep yourself in that old school neighborhood feel. 

Thai Basil gets big stars for being one of these homey neighborhood joints. Along with El Pollo, Tops, Tempe Bicycle, HTC, Otto's, Headquarters, Buffalo, etc., this locally owned restaurant has consistently provided inviting ambiance, wonderful service and delicious food for pennies compared to anything on Mill.

I just finished my leftover red curry chicken just before I wrote this, and it was every bit as savory and rich as it was last night (just make sure to put the leftover sticky rice in a plastic bag or it'll get crusty). The fragrance and flavor of all their curries (red, green, yellow, and peanut) is if not unmatched, pretty damn close to the best offered at any Thai place I've dined. Thick, al dente, crinkle cut carrots, bamboo shoots, green beans, broccoli, zucchini, red and green peppers with tender choice of meat afloat in savory coconut milk that suspends the perfect amount of earthy spice and hot chili to ensure that the meal dances on your taste buds.

My favorite dishes aside, just about everything on the menu at Thai Basil has proved to be exemplary. The Thai Basil is their signature dish and certainly doesn't skimp on its namesake fresh basil and thick flavorful sauce. The Pad Thai is sure as hell better than what's offered at Bamboo Club, with ample crushed peanuts and noodles that don't turn into a puddle of goo once the dish cools. The Garlic Pork has a lighter sauce that still manages all the fragrance and flavor of its more syrupy counterparts. The papaya salad is crisp, citric, sweet and spicy, an excellent accompaniment to a rich meal. Or try the crispy spring rolls that manage to be filling despite their humble size. The chicken satay with peanut sauce is also a very good choice for picky eaters (or kiddos), although they'll truly miss out on the more complex flavors of this amazing food. 

Thai Basil is a fairly small restaurant with dark wood tables that are all very closely spaced to ensure the maximum number of people can be seated. There is booth seating along the back and stretching the length of one side, while high tables and chairs are located in the windowed area facing Farmer. The decorations are sparse but complement the overall Asian feel, with bamboo accessories, knick knacks and family pictures decorating the walls. The richly colored, metallic embroidered skirt\/pants worn by the waitresses are also for sale if you're looking for something special to spice up your wardrobe.

Despite its small size, I've never experienced the long wait times that others have when I come here. The servers have always been very attentive and quick to refill a glass or take my order, and are honest with their opinion when asked what they enjoy on the menu. I don't generally go here on busy nights though, and the hours I attend are either early or late evening, so maybe I avoid the hectic rush, because the kitchen is pretty small. At least you know you're getting fresh Thai from the folks who know it best as a result. If you don't have a lot of time to wait and just want a quick dinner, it's also possible to phone in your order or walk in, order, visit the shops around the restaurant and return in ten minutes to a piping hot order.

Try out the lunch specials! They're a great deal and they get you in and out within the hour. Although this is the one time of the day I've been when it's a bit on the slow side, since the entire restaurant is always packed. But the crowd is oddly well staggered since I've never seen anyone waiting for a table. For about eight bucks you get a small salad with tangy sweet vinaigrette, a spring roll with sweet and sour sauce, and your choice of dish with a ball of rice on the side. It's usually enough so I have one extra lunch leftover, compared to the two lunches I usually have with the regular dinner dishes. 

One thing I've noticed over time is that their "hot" really isn't that hot, so if you like it spicy, make sure to specify. 

Thai Basil is a comfortable neighborhood restaurant that attracts the type of customers Mill Avenue only wishes it could, loyal ones. As Mill whores itself out to the highest corporate bidder, I envision the property owners diving through coins like Scrooge McDuck and doing their best impression of Mr. Burns'. But the obscene retail rent checks signed reflects the boost in product price and the blandness of corporate hegemony. It's a relief for this starving-but-no-longer-student to support a local eatery by driving just a little west of that circus.
Went here over Christmas to see the beautiful cactus garden all decked out in lights - it did not disappoint!  A truly fun and beautiful display!  This is definitely on my must-visit list every Christmas as long as I live here!  And, best of all, it's free to visit and meander through!

I have to be honest: I don't like chocolate, unless it's very dark chocolate.  That being said, the friend I visited with and I shared a couple of bars we bought, and they were both delicious.  It's cool that they let you see the actual factory where they make it, though I was disappointed because it wasn't really doing much of anything while I was there.  I look forward to visiting here during other parts of the year, when there aren't lights on all the cacti, but certainly also when it's Christmas time again.  = )
We've been in the market for several weeks looking for the right bar stools to fit in our built in BBQ.  I've been trying to find a used set but just can't find the right size.  There are not too many patio stores in the East valley so our options were limited and nobody had the size we needed.  

I went into the store on a Tuesday and spoke with the owner Dan, he was very knowledgeable and helpful when I explained our odd sized BBQ.  He helped me size out just the right stools to fit it perfectly and even recommended the ones with no arms so that they wouldn't knock on our uniquely low bar top.

I was pleased with the size, style, and price so I bought 4 of them.  We also had purchased custom Sunbrella cushions from another local shop and Dan was able to match the fabric exactly and he is having them made for us.  The chairs came a few days later and the cushions will be done in a few weeks (its the busy season).  Dan was nice enough to give us temporary ones to use until ours come in.

I'm thankful we found this place and next time we're in need of anything we'll definitely drop by here first.
Best taco place in town. 2.50$ for a taco, authentic and delicious. The Tortilla soup was also the best I've had outside of Mexico! Great spot in an up and coming neighbourhood.
Loved the atmosphere and all the staffs recommendations were on point. Tuna poke tacos and the butter chicken we're our favorites.
The wait time was absolutely ridiculous! We were forewarned it would be about 15 minutes, but it was more like 45. I don't know who chose the music selection, but let's just say it wasn't exactly appropriate for the restaurant. One of the cooks was more interested in his phone than actually cooking and serving food. There's plenty of other options at the mall to eat or even the surrounding area. I gave a 3 since our waiter was nice and the food was good with the exception of my mom's cold burger.
This place seems pretty grungy at first glance and it hasn't changed much since it was first opened it seems but the food seems quality at this particular location. The chicken seems well done or at least that your not gonna get sick from it and the biscuits are fantastic as usual... I would say the only qualm I have is the cleanliness of the place which doesn't seem great. both inside and out there is always trash all over the parking lot and the tables never seem cleaned inside. all in all, they are ok and i will return for the fried chicken!
Yum, Yum, Yum!  Went here for a late lunch, and was surprised how busy it was for almost 2:00pm.  The two of us were able to be seated right away, and received super fast service.  The hummus is delicious, although they give you a huge plate of hummus and only 1 pita with the small order....I could've used a couple more, but whatev.  The greek salad I had was the perfect size and delicious.  Just what I want in a light lunch!  

Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots, or dinner spots when I'm not eating pizza.  :)
So you wanna get a beer and not sure what to drink, well Yard house will satisfy...


This yard house has been one of the great successes at Red Rock casino, with a lot of places opening and closing within the casino this business should be around for a while.

The yard house has more beers than you can drink in 10 sittings from all over the states and the world. If the Cheesecake Factory is the queen of cheesecake well Yard house is the king of beers. (Sorry Budweiser)

The service is quite fast but with  weekends and nights a reservation is a must.

Food wise, the menu is extensive with great apps and a nicely portion sized entrees. I've never got to the deserts as I'm always full half way through my main.

Shepard's pie was the last meal I had which was a saint Patricks day special. It was a little overboard with the amount of sauce and the pastry was most of the plate which became a little much while eating.

Prices are a little high but the general quality of food is above regular pub foods.
We stopped by the House of 1000 Beers one afternoon after visiting Deer Lakes Park, as it had been suggested to us before by a friend.  My husband is a huge beer advocate so the name itself sold him, ha!  We sat out of the small deck which was pleasant.  We were up high enough that being close to the road really didn't bother us at all- infact we barely noticed it.  We each ordered a beer off their menu, which they serve in, I believe, 4 oz pours.. so you can leave plenty of room to try lots!  I ordered a small pizza.. which was huge.  It was so so good, but it was HUGE.  My husband ordered the wings which come in 1 flavor, but they were really good.  Sometimes I question places that dont give you a flavor option for things like wings, but they honestly dont need more than 1 here.  Our server was really nice and she was everything you'd expect of a server - attentive, prompt, thorough - the works.  We were the only people there eating when we arrived, although more had come throughout the hour or so we were there, but regardless, she was very good.  I have no doubt we'll return to the House of 1,000 Beers the next time we're out that way!
So my husband daughter and I went here on a Sunday.  Little did we know that it was supposed to close only 10 minutes after we arrived.  They were gracious and fed us well anyway.
My husband got the double burger with fries and salad.  Let's just say the man can eat a lot but was not able to finish his portion no matter how badly he wanted to.  The fries were perfect and the burger was gone.
My daughter got the Arizona omelet with hashbrowns and pancakes.  She is not a big eater but quickly finished her omelet and one of the pancakes that was bigger than her head.  She decided to take the other pancake and her hashbrowns home.  I got the burrito with spinach, sour cream, mushrooms, and cheddar cheese.  I couldn't believe how light and fluffy the eggs were and how perfectly blended the ingredients were.  The meal was fantastic.  I was extremely surprised at how good the food and service was even though we came at closing time.  The staff was the best and we kinda got taken care of by everyone.  I am going back there again but hopefully not as a nuisance.
Comment ne pas aimer le Mondial...Admission gratuite...on peut déguster plusieurs bières à 2-3 coupons (2-3$) Beaucoup de choix :) Super ambiance et il  y a une terrasse :)
Last weekend, I saw a sign outside of Evolver for student rates for Duquesne students. Today I just felt like getting a tattoo, so I went in for a walk-in. Bunny was able to take me immediately. She was super nice and patient. She answered all of my questions and explained the whole process in detail. She was also very quick, the whole tattoo took about 20 minutes. I am very impressed with Evolver and will definitely be back.
Visited the new Ballantyne location of Midwood Smokehouse yesterday for lunch. I was by myself and figured the location would be insanely crowded, but decided to walk in to see.

I've tried to talk my husband into going, but he's always adamant that he likes to give new restaurants "a month or so" to work out any kinks before he tries them. Since he was off doing something else for the afternoon, it was my chance to try it without him.

The restaurant was busy, but there was no wait and there were seats available at the bar. I grabbed a chair and ordered a PBR ($2.50 drafts!) and after a brief review of the menu, figured I'd try the side dishes\/veggie combination plate instead of going for actual barbecue on this visit. I figure this way my husband can't get TOO upset that I went without him for my first visit! 

I ordered the creamed corn, cole slaw and stuffed jalapenos. I was originally going to get hushpuppies as one of the items but Chad, the bartender, assured me my dish would come with a few since the platter of sides was considered a "plate". When it came out devoid of hushpuppies he noticed instantly and said to the foodrunner,  "We're going to need a side of hushpuppies and pickled onions for that." They were delivered right away. Thanks for having my back, Chad!

The creamed corn was delicious. I chose to believe it was "healthy" in spite of the clear abundance of well, cream, in the dish. I was least enthusiastic for the coleslaw, but it ended up being my favorite item on the plate! The 3 jalapenos were delicious, but a little small. I'm used to a friend's bacon-wrapped jalapenos which are not halved, and are enormous. 

Some people have written that they find the hush puppies too sweet. I find them to be just perfect, no ketchup needed to enjoy! I also loved the pickled onions. I devoured everything on my plate quickly, and found it to be just the right amount of food. I've never had a chance to try all the delicious sides I've wanted, so this was a great opportunity.

Chad made me feel welcome and was very attentive, getting me a second PBR just before mine went empty. We shared some Words with Friends strategy during a moment of downtime, as he saw I was playing on my phone.

I was very impressed just watching Chad work. He handled a few carry out orders, and as each one showed up, he opened up all the containers to quality check them, and went back for a few items with each one. This restaurant, being so new, probably still has a little confusion going on, but he made sure every order was right, whether it was mine or the carryout orders.

All told, my bill was $12.99 for a delicious meal and 2 PBR's. The value for what I received can't be beat!

I was originally thinking I might be uncomfortable eating solo at what is so clearly a sit down family restaurant, but the bartenders were all very friendly, and it was such an enjoyable lunch I definitely see swinging by for more solo lunches in the future!
Food on the strip tends to be cheap and disgusting or super expensive and delicious.  Since we didn't want to spend an arm and a leg for every meal, we tried this place.  Just a mile down from the strip where all the asia restaurants seem to be, this place was humble in decor, which was a good sign.  However, it was not too packed on a Friday night, not a great sign.  I ordered the Wonton noodle soup and the broth was good but it didn't taste like it went through many hours of meat, bone, and marrow stewing.  The meat within the wonton tasted like it was previously frozen and it didn't have a great balance of meat and veg.  I ordered Thai Ice Tea with Boba and the Boba were super gummy, which meant they had been sitting in syrup for a while.  

Overall, better than McDonalds but not the best Pho place.
A great friend of us recommend this restaurant to us, we had great expectations before we got there because of the reviews on Yelp, and guess what they were fulfilled! The service is amazing because you never have to wait long for anything you need, no problem for water refills or rice refills, lol ! 
 The egg rolls are small but delicious perfect for an appetizer !
You are gonna get a big surprise when you get your food, Can you say flavorful!!!!
Ahh, Cockburn Street, my picturesquely twisting friend, what delights you hold!

Cockburn Street is pretty much top of my list for present shopping, due to its abundance of cute'n'kooky little shops. It's just the right side of sketchy - some of its establishments look a little seedy but in a colourful and good-natured manner, while others are cute and bubbly.

As a street, it's a real picture. Old, cobbled, and winding in a tight curl from High Street to Market Street, walking down it feels like scooting down a shop-lined version of Moonface's Slippery Slip in the Magic Faraway Tree books. Dark closes challenge you with endless steps to left and right, where if you just pick one randomly, you might find a shortcut, or you might add several minutes and a potential cardiac arrest to your journey.

It's also one of the streets that gets gritted in snowy conditions so it's among the less perilous of the Old Town's winter attractions.
Visited for the first time last night and for a Saturday night the place was a madhouse. Still, the bartenders kept their cool, were fast on the drinks, and kept a smile on their faces throughout all the crazy.

Didn't eat at Blackfinn last night, but their menu looked good so we stopped in just before noon today for lunch. Also wanted to see the restaurant when it wasn't packed wall to wall. Service was really prompt and solid, which almost always is the challenge new restaurants face. The wait staff seemed very well trained and I was impressed.

Fish and chips were delicious. My husband loved his French dip style sandwich. I like this location much better than the uptown location. We'll be back!
Arti was fabulous and his designs spoke to my flair for bright colors and soft flowing feminine fabrics.  I'm a student of Dance and I was elated to see so many clothes that accentuate the artful gracefulness of movement. To top it off, the music playing softly in the background titillated my senses for the beautiful art of dance and everything beautiful.  

It was a beautiful experience meeting Arti and shopping at Vasari!!!!
My friend and I had a great evening of fun planned to celebrate her (finally!) graduating med school, so we decided to get blowouts at Le Stylebar. 

She arrived slightly before our appointment, and for some reason was pressured into starting her blowout right away. I did not receive any welcome when I arrived and after 5 confusing minutes I had to go ask the receptionist who my hairstylist was. 

Even though my friend had told them that we were together when booking the appointment, WE WERE NOT SEATED TOGETHER. The hairstylist simply told me they all had their own stations and she couldn't do anything about it. Why would I recommend this place to girls looking for a blowout bar for girls night or a bachelorette party if they don't even bother seating you together?!

I read here that they offered complimentary tea or coffee and let you use an iPad while they worked on your hair. The receptionist only realized I didn't have a drink midway through my blowout. I never saw the iPad. 

I didn't see my friend until her blowout was over. For what it's worth, my hair looked nice but it wasn't what I requested.
Great tasting food and service, but they must use preservatives or MSG because everyone in our party of 4 had an upset stomach afterwards even though we all ordered something different.  Next time I will ask about preservatives in the food.
I have waited a long time for Panera to make it out to Phoenix and I'm less then impressed so far. Parking is awful during the lunch rush. I came in, ordered, paid $13 for a half sandwich, soup and large drink. Pastries are $.99 extra. Pepsi products only with a few tea options. My food took almost 20 minutes to get, thank goodness I get an hour for lunch! Seating spaces are awkward unless you get a booth. I would rather get the cookie instead of the roll with my meal, which I didn't even eat. My turkey avocado BLT on sourdough was good, as well as my fuji apple chicken salad. Food runners were constantly confused of where orders were going and was asked several times if random orders were mine. I know they just opened but they certainly have a lot of kinks to work out before I come back.
I went to Vine Restaurant for a meeting with a group of friends.  Immediately I was impressed with the decor of the restaurant. I loved the way you could see the chef cooking the food from your table and the "Barrel Room" my group had which is a private room inside the restaurant was nice and cozy. instead of solid walls most of the room was surrounded by glass but you had the option to make it more private by closing the curtain. The food was also phenomenal! Our group had an opportunity to try several appetizers and wine.  My favorites are the Southwestern Guacamole which was chunky and tasty. The New Orleans BBQ Shrimp was fantastic the sauce that is placed over it is amazing. The Maytag blue cheese chips and  fried green tomatoes were great as well. The Vine also has a great wine selection. The food and the private room we had were amazing but none of this would have been possible without the server we had, her name is Alex and her service was on point from start to finish. She consistently checked on our group and had a pleasant demeanor and was very knowledgeable if we had questions about the menu. She also made sure that our glasses were always full and kept our group's table very organized. I was very pleased with the service Alex provided along with the food that was served. Let's just say that I'll be back to this place very soon! P.S. Thanks again Alex for making our experience at Vine memorable!
Pizza didn't live up to the hype. Pretty standard fare. The restaurant itself is cozy though I'm not a fan of the low ceilings and feeling trapped underground. Oops.
Terrible place. The service was good but the food was terrible. It's like the worst fast food you can imagine. You might as well just grab something cold from the news stand.
Love the ambiance super cute. Doubt we will be back prices are super high for a hamburger $17 is crazy. Maybe if service was up to par it wouldn't have bothered me so much.  Food is good but overpriced.
Caffe Boa is a hidden gem on Mill Avenue, for both eating, drinking and relaxing with friends. It's a little bit on the pricey side though, so take advantage of the happy hour and half-priced sangria Sundays.

It used to be a tiny, homey little cafe next to Long Wong's at 7th Street and Mill and has since been converted into a spacious, classy winery and Italian bistro at 4th Street and Mill.

Happy hour specials are only extended to the bar area, which is tiny in comparison to the rest of the area. There's the traditional happy hour from 5 to 7, and a reverse happy hour that begins after 10 pm. (Check which days this is available though, because I'm not sure it's daily.) Draft beers like Guiness and Harp are two bucks, wine by the glass is half off (3 to 6 bucks after the discount), as are their fancy pants cocktails (generally 5 bucks)--the espresso martini is decadent--and all appetizers aside from the huge cheese plate are half priced. One wonky thing about the tab for happy hour is that they take the discount off at the end, so just keep a running tab in your head of how much you owe if you're with a group to make things go a little smoother.

I'm in lust with the Shrimp Adriatico, which is an appetizer that has five big tiger shrimp swimming in garlic tomato sauce that's served with a loaf of bread for dipping. It's filling enough to serve as an entire meal, or to share among friends.

On Sundays, pitchers of sangria are half priced ($15 instead of $30) and are a refreshing way to relax with a group of friends in the afternoon. I prefer the white wine over the red because it compliments the freshly sliced apples and muddled citrus. Make sure to ask them to go easy on the cinnamon though, or you may end up with an overpowering flavor and chalky texture.

Dinner is always divine as well, but a little bit on the pricey side. The meals are huge though, so you're pretty much guaranteed leftovers or you can split an entre with another person for an extra 3 buck charge. The Voodoo Penne is a delicious Cajun flavored dish, Lucas' Meatballs are savory and filling, and the Pola Pola is some awesome artichoke ravioli. Everything is done well and I rarely encounter problems with the servers or bartenders.

It's a nice, mellow break from the hubbub of Mill Avenue.

***UPDATE***
I've been a little peeved lately at the happy hour, since it's only extended to the bar and the bar is so damn tiny. Now I understand that if I don't get there around 5 I have no chance of getting a seat. That's fine. But the damn Chase employees get there around 4:30 (before Happy Hour even starts, where's the logic in that?) and hog all the damn seats, leaving me with nothing but shattered hope and an empty glass. You better shape up, Caffe Boa, or I'm docking a star!
***UPDATE***
You've been docked a star Boa. You went and increased the prices of your entrees by three bucks at the very least. Fuck you and your scrumtious, mouth watering 19 dollar spaghetti and meatballs. They're fucking meatballs, Boa! Plus your half price on glasses of wine less than 10 bucks is a pretty useless deal now. Jeezy creezy.

This isn't goodbye though. I'll still chill with you on Sundays for the sangria, but I shall never indulge in the pola pola, voodoo penne or your shitty Willow Bakery bread again. Bastards.
So happy about their 3rd location. Food is just as good as the original location and about the same amount of seating. If you are looking for good Taiwanese food, this is my go to.
Room was great until we saw a scorpion in our room. Seriously? It was my first scorpion sighting so not only was I freaked out, I was excited! Service was good.
Been to couple of Melting Pots around the US. Great happy hour bar menu. Not a fan of the food. My wife favorite place in Charlotte. Over priced. Good for special occasions.
Amazing downtown attraction!

Great concept, has shopping, activities for the kids and food and wine for the parents.

I'd recommend this place for just about any type of outing.

Families, dates or even just a sneaky bite and drink to eat
Sometimes, even when I'm not thirsty, I drive thru my local Dutch brothers just to restore my faith in humanity. Everyone there is all smiles and gives off an incredible amount of positive energy. The ice tea, and attention for even my 4 year old son is what brings me back. Well done, Dutch Bros!
Top notch bakery by any standard. My only complaint is the fact the handful of times they were closed for vacation when I was in the area and decided to stop in.  All the croissants are amazing!
En veux-tu de la télé? Il y en a...! Sérieux c'est super, pichet pas cher..Mais le fait que ça soit éloigné et dans un quartier industriel, attendez-vous à voir une clientèle de monsieurs moustachus qui sortent de la shop...
This is not a circus at all...there were 2-3 acrobatic acts that were ok...but not jawdropping...cirque used to make me gasp...this show would have been better on E....bc the music and lighting events...overall it was like a dance performance.....ending up leaving halfway through....that says something...
Go early and bring ear plugs. A bt noisy. Very friendly staff but there was only 2 of us and they didn't seat us right away because the tables open were for 6 or more.
I came for brunch with some friends with few expectations. I'm normally on the west side and thought I was spoiled by the quality and quantity of places there, but Fourk was delicious. My steak and eggs were honestly amazing. The value for the dish is high, and I would highly recommend both the venue and the meal.
Best biryani in Scarborough.....portion is good and quality is great.  I normally get my order extra spicy and silver spoon never fails to satisfy me.
Service has improved a lot.
I ordered delivery last night from Xo Chinese. The lady who took my ordered was friendly and patient.  She said it would take about 30-40 minutes for delivery, and as promised the food arrived about 40 minutes. The delivery guy was friendly. Overall, I was very pleased with the customer service I received from them. 

I ordered:
Crab Ragoon-Delicious! I almost ate them all, but I had to contain myself. 
Chicken Lo Mien-Lots of chicken! 
Crispy Walnut Shrimp-The shrimps were big and delicious. Better than the Chinese food that I usually order from Chinatown.  
Orange Chicken-It was good.

Bonus: Two free egg rolls! The egg rolls were decent, but nothing spectacular.

I would order from Xo Chinese Food again.
Food is average. Atmosphere nice. I've been here about 6 times and each time food got worse. Only thing I'd get if I went back would be a burger.
I was in a big rush, trying to get ready for a night out and needed my nails done, so I popped into here, basically because it was close and they said they could take me right away. 

I had never been in before, because the price list was pricey, but decided that given my rush, I would bite the bullet and suck it up.

The people were all very pleasant. I said I was wearing a purple dress and asked for feedback on colours and they gave good opinions and were very nice. Then I was led into a back rooms, where I was instructed to sit on a padded bench and put my feet in a large, metal bowl of water. THIS was a new one. I have never had to put my feet in a mixing bowl while getting nails done.

The seat, while padded, was not particularly comfortable and it was awkward getting up on it and off it again. The pedicure was standard with most places I have been.

The nails were more in keeping with what I was used to, sitting at a nail table. I said I was in a bit of a rush, but she still seemed to really take her time. I didn't push it, because I didn't want to be rude. The nails were fine, but not perfect...some have some bubbling in the polish and others are a bit crooked.

Here's the kicker though...the bill came to $60!! That's almost twice as much as other nail places and it's certainly not a better place in terms of the facilities and job they do! That doesn't even include tip.

The people in there were all older and seemed to be regulars, so I guess they have a customer base, but I certainly won't be part of that! Even in a rush, this place was just not worth it. There are a number of nail salons popping up in the area as it continues to get built up. They better watch themselves, because with so many other options there is no reason to go here.
Came here usually for a quick cheap meal that has rice, meat and some veggies on it. It is usually pretty dependable for one of those days when you're too lazy to cook. The annoying thing: they open & close whenever they feel like it. This place closes at 12PM, EXCEPT on Thursday. They close 1.5 hour early. What the heck is that!? Just change the damn sign! Write the ACTUAL time you close! 

Sincerely,
Your Frustrated & Hungry Condo Citizen
First impression on Yummy Cantonese Restaurant. Crowded, unorganised, dirty and incompetent service at the front and in the restaurant itself. 

I gave it 1 star. Purely based on the food taste, mediocrity. Other wise this place don't deserve anything better. With the choices available in markham \/ scarborough, I will never visit yummy again.
This facility seems very nice and while I am not a senior, it does offer classes and activities that apply to my age group! Most recently, my husband and I enrolled in a beginning French course that is once a week for 3 months. It was much more affordable than a traditional college course and I hope have a solid grasp on the subject when all is said and done.

The building itself is nice and in a lovely area of Scottsdale. There is a small but adequate exercise equipment area and I have also noticed some gals shakin' it to Zumba. Not the caliber of LA Fitness or 24 Hour by a long shot but might be nice for those preferring a quiet workout atmosphere.
I'm new to working Uptown 5 days a week in the south\/Wells Fargo\/Duke Energy\/Ally area. Coworker took me here today, and I was duly impressed!

The line gets long, but moves quickly. Tables were always available, but just barely, around the noon lunch hour. They do a lot of carry out business.

The food was a very, VERY tall step above what you get at Tintin, up north where BofA offices are located. If you dine-in, your meal is served on a nice plate with real silverware and sauce.

For lunch I got the steak and broccoli, substituting onions & zucchini for sweet carrots (.50 cents) and a soda.

The food arrived quickly and was delicious! It was honestly like eating at a Benihana without the drama of a table show. The steak was perfectly cooked, the meal was tasty and filling, and it was the best amount of food to avoid a full-on afternoon food coma. Great value for the money spent!

Added bonus: Huy Fong Sriracha at the table!

It was so delicious, I plan on going tomorrow for my weekly lunch with my husband! This is a gem. I foresee many more lunches spent here.
When interviewing for a job, they say the interviewer makes a decision in the first 5 seconds. First impressions are likewise important with food, I'm sorry but pastries and cookies sometimes just look good, and sometimes just don't. The presentation of pastries here was underwhelming, nothing "looked" good, and the decor was subpar (I'm not a big decor guy, but it does leave an impression).  

Der Brokorb is a small tucked away bakery and sandwich place in Woodchester mall.  A selection of freshly baked breads ($3 per loaf) lines the wall behind the counter which has a small selection of pastries, homemade cookies and desserts.

I stopped by for breakfast, but not a whole lot looked especially appetizing. The only thing that quirked my interest was this chocolate almond cookie thing  ($1.50, see the picture), but it wasn't very tasty. There wasn't another person in the place, so I'm questioning whether turnover is a problem and how fresh the pastries are.


Individual apple pies ($3 each), homemade cookies ($3 per box) looked fairly average.

On the positive side of things, when I walked in through the door I was hit with the smell of freshly baking bread so maybe their breads are pretty good. I wouldn't mind trying a sandwich, but the pastries and cookies didn't leave a good impression.  

Not much of a place for decor, had a few tables for sit down as they serve sandwiches and soups during lunch.
I love this nail salon. They are super clean. Not your average nail shop. They really  pay attention to customer service and they are all so super nice. I had James do my pink and whites and he did a fab job!! I will definetly come back. You always get what you pay for so they might cost a little more than other places, but well worth it!!!
The location has changed as of yesterday. Location is now 5750 Decatur.  Nice BIG new building.
cute place on a side street - really only serving the locals around the Woodbine\/Danforth area.

bf ordered a coffee here that he thought was pretty good. they seem to have smoothies and fresh juices as well. and nifty rice bowls. 

will be back to try out the juices and food.

seems to be a quiet place to chill for a couple of hours.
If I'm a fan of a pasta place, you know it's pretty much awesome. Especially if I'd go there again. 

The atmosphere is awesome and the whole vibe of the restaurant is very relaxing but in an elegant, royal, sexy way. The gorgeous reds mixed with copper make me swoon. Enter a gorgeous waiter and I might try to live there. 

Both times I have been at Bada Boom I have had fantastic food. It was prepared well, presented well, and served within a reasonable amount of time. There are always several items on the menu I am dying to try, which says a lot as I don't like tomatoes or red sauce all that much. 

On one occasion I was there, it was a little rowdy at the bar area, but fortunately the main dining area is completely separated by the courtyard entrance and is not a distraction at all.
I came here for dinner and HH with a friend, after hearing nothing but raving reviews about LGO! I actually drove past it the first time but was able to find it after a quick U-turn (legally of course!). The market is lovely with all kinds of things to look at, the bakery was stocked full of yummy goodies and breads galore! We were seated in the dining room and our waitress was very sweet and attentive. 

After looking at the menu's, we noticed there wasn't much of a HH (only 2 wines for $5, $1 off cocktails and $2 beers). My friend and I ordered Sangria (OK I had 2) and thought it was quite tasty and full of fruit to nibble on afterwards. We split the smoked salmon salad, which was amazing! Perfect amount to split with someone because we also ordered the roasted corn pizza. Wow, the pizza was so good! I didn't think corn in a pizza would taste this good but it really does, as it was layered underneath the cheese and sourdough pie! Since we saw all the amazing bakery items beforehand, we had to order the Smore's cupcake (to split!). It was also incredible and rich, glad we split it! 

I had a really great time and will be back! Delish!
As other's have stated, ther'es no shower, which can be a pretty big pain point if you're just slipping in a workout and not near home. They do have a full set of dumb bells, but *very* little free weights outside of that. No squat rack, bench, or anything. There is a bar you can use for cleans or deadlifts, but overall it's fairly limited. 

But if you're the machine kinda gal or gal you'll be fine(machine's as in you use machines, not that you are a machine. Or maybe you are a machine, or not, but on machines... you know what I mean).

One thing they do have here which is neat, are ropes. Not for pull ups, but for waving up and down... so that the rope looks like a snake... or a wave... you know, that arm workout thing you see elite athletes do... ya, I have no idea what it's called... can we just call it "the rope"? The ropes bump this from a 2 star to 3 star, since I haven't seen ropes at any other gym. 

They also have two punching bags, which you can use to punch, kick, body check, hug, or kiss, 24\/7!
I have been waiting YEARS for Cheddar's to make it's way to Arizona. I honestly didn't think it would ever happen but now that it's here, I'm in HEAVEN!! 

This location is prime, just on the other side of the 101 to Chandler Mall. Restaurant is extremely clean and looks amazing. You would think from the inside this is a fancy restaurant until you read the prices and think "YES, good food that's actually affordable!" Since this is a new restaurant, expect to wait unless of course you come at like 9:30PM on a weeknight. Service was friendly and efficient, even though it was busy when we came. We ordered an appetizer of chips and queso (adding meat is FREE). Delicious! I ordered the Chicken Caesar  pasta salad, which has been my go-to dish at Cheddar's ever since I've known about it. I think my favorite part of the meal is the unbelievably soft and buttery croissant that comes with the meal. I could eat an entire tray of those things. In fact, during this visit, I had 3 and they only charged me for 2. We didn't get dessert- too full honestly. My boyfriend had a few drinks as well and walked out of there for $40. 

Great value, food and service. I will keep coming back!!!
Jamie in the customer service section in the back was amazing!! I am a local and just moved to Lake Tahoe and I came in for a necklace repair!! She was so awesome to my mom and I!
A good place for kids, since the interior is similar to a pit stop or garage with a car\/motorcycle theme.  I guess they do well on alcohol sales, because there are 2 distinct bar areas.  I was seated in Scotty's bar area, and he had me try a fantastic pale ale.  The food is similar to Buffalo Wild Wings, if you have ever been there.  It's mostly sandwiches, salads, wraps, and chicken wings.  On a day where the temperatures hit -5 F, the hot food and prompt service were definitely appreciated.  Sit in Scotty's section if you want some local knowledge or need advice on beer!
Singapore rice noodles are delicious! Haven't had a dish this good since my dads cooking! 
Will come back
Huge selection but their hidden fees are extremely high. Additionally you can't get these folks to give you a price or price difference between models unless you fill-out particular forms.
Okay, this is not some fine, dinning establishment. This is a diner. Not only that, but apparently it's a 24 hour diner, so that's pretty frigging awesome. Good to know. Those come in handy.

As a diner, it's food was perfectly acceptable and actually very good. The service was excellent! Prices were decent. I don't know what else you need!

I came for lunch with a ground of friends. We wanted drinks, we wanted food, some wanted breakfast food (they have all day breakfast...also awesome) and this fit the bill perfectly. 

Our waitress was very sweet and accommodating and fast with the food and drinks. She split up all our bills for us, with no problem (so many places it's like the biggest deal ever). 

Everyone enjoyed their food and we certainly got a variety of it. All large portions. Drinks were good, so no complaints there! 

The atmosphere is...well let's call it quaint. It has some dated decor and paintings on the wall of a sort of olden-days train station. It's a diner, so it is what it is!

Only criticism of this place is that it only takes cash. They have an ATM in the front, but be prepared. 

Otherwise, I would totally come back to this place! They made one mean grilled cheese!
Always a good time!  And, FINALLY, we received tech tees instead of plain old cotton t-shirts.  The expo has a lot going on, and is always packed.  One thing:  The expo should either be for runners only or not allow double strollers.  Seriously!  

We took the shuttle from the finish line to the start with no problems.  Several others told us they've had to wait for 30 mins at other races, so I think we lucked out!

The course is pretty flat with a lot of spectators and a lot of runners, but the corral system works pretty well.  The finish line is well stocked with volunteers, food, and water.  Definitely a fun race!
Definitely not the cleanest Denny's I've ever eaten at.

Rather than being greeted when I walk in like I experience at most Denny's I was pretty much ignored for 5 minutes.

We were finally shown to a table and ignored again for awhile. 

Ignored again for awhile until they remembered to ask us if we'd like something to drink.

Are you getting the picture? Very slow service here? 

The food and service was very below average for Denny's .
I know this is a popular spot.  I know the owners are down to earth, friendly and nice people.  I even like their food even though none of it qualifies for food good for your heart.  In fact, you could even claim that I love their food cause well, I just love hot dogs . . . it's one thing that's hard for me to 100% delete from my diet.  I cheat with hot dogs the way others cheat with their cigarettes.  Sometimes I'll give my husband an excuse, get in my car then drive to get an ever so yummy hot dog.  I'm just kidding, well, almost.  

I also love creativity and you have to admit these guys are creative~ infusing all kinds of flavours and combinations to their doggies and tasting all so yum, yum. 

Speaking of doggies.  This brings me to the reason of 3 stars.  The night we were there, all Elite Yelpers mind you so I mean, you know, we're going to be writing reviews, we're having a good time, tasting practically everything on the menu, including the fried green tomato salad (which is delectable and you get your veggies in).

Here we were, enjoy ourselves when I looked over at another table and there is a LARGE dog sitting by the table, lapping it up, doing I don't know what and well, this dog was not a seeing dog.  Just a regular, friendly, happy dog. And don't get me wrong, I like dogs . . . just not INSIDE the restaurant of where I'm eating.  I could be wrong but I think having this dog inside the restaurant violated several health code violations.

If having dogs inside restaurants is a new trend I'm NOT aware of and it complies with Photenix health code for restaurants, send me a message and I will update this review.  Otherwise, please keep the doggies on the plate, not inside the restaurant where it will cause me to question the cleanliness of the place!
First of all, who doesn't love a 24 hour drive thru?? I tried this place after hearing nothing but amazing things to test it out for myself. I tried the chocolate sprinkles, glaze and devils food cake donuts. They were all amazing!! I was also pleasantly surprised to find out they have boba teas as well. Next time I go, I will be trying one of those too!
You simply cannot beat this place. Bang for your buck at its finest with some of best noodle dishes I've ever had. The dumplings are to die for. The Pork Potstickers were so moist and flavorful, best dumplings around. This is a staple for us at least once a month. Be aware that when you dine in there is usually a wait on the weekends and the restaurant does tend to get packed in fast. So we tend to go early or go with their quick pick up.  The best part of this place is that everything noodle wise is made in house. You can watch the cooks making the noodles, and when you have them you can really taste the difference. A well priced one of a kind restaurant.
I give up on this place! I have gotten burritos and other things from this place on several occasions and it's always been sub-par. Bland food, overcooked, sometimes burnt (nachos). As a result, I haven't bothered going or ordering from there in well over a year. Well, today I had a craving for Mexican and since Toronto has a huge lack of Mexican restaurant choices and because I'm busy working at home, my husband and myself decided to order from BarBurrito's delivery. I should also mention that if you go to justeat.ca BarBurrito charges $7 delivery. Orderit.ca has no charge. Don't know if that's the ordering website or the restaurant, but it's a tip for anyone who decides to order from this place.

So I went ahead and placed the order...only to have it be "rejected" by BarBurrito, because they are busy right now. This restaurant is listed on two different food ordering sites, but they won't deliver if they don't feel inclined?? SERIOUSLY! 

So I have learned my lesson. Don't give places second, or even third chances. And this place...don't even give it a first chance. Not worth it at ALL.
This cafe is full of natural light, vegetarian friendly options, and friendly staff.

I have their classic breakfast once week and I always enjoy it. The food is reasonably priced and always very fresh. The Decore is very inviting and well considered.
It was my first time at Mr. Mamas. So far everything was exceptional; the service, the food and, the location. 

We went here for Sunday brunch. It is to be expected that they were packed. The guy who took my name said it will be around 25-30 minutes wait. He was awesome at what he does by the way. He kept us updated the whole time and he explained to anyone who walks in that the time is just an estimate and that it is not guaranteed. When we were finally seated, our waitress Jasmine was really nice and attentive. My coffee cup was never close to being empty. The manager would also stop by to check on us and ask us if we need anything else. This place really knows how to make their customers feel at home. 

We ordered eggs Benedict, a pancake and an order of biscuits and gravy. It was nice of Jasmine to give us a heads up about their gravy.  Their gravy is not regular gravy. It has bacon bits and maple syrup in it. It sounded interesting so we gave it a try. It was so delicious! It was creamy and rich but not too heavy. The biscuits were crispy so it blends so perfectly with the creaminess of the gravy. The pancake was not dense and had a good texture. The benny was also amazing. The eggs were seasoned well and the bacon was cooked until it is crispy but not dry\/hard. The hash browns were to die for! It was crispy on the exterior but was still soft and moist on the insides. 

I highly recommend this place. Good food and good price.
They really care about your experience. One of the best Korean restaurants if you're looking for authentic. Their Kalbi and Bulgogi dishes are amazing. Delicious food, side dish was really good. Good flavor, great service. We had stone rice and it was Delicious.
I love everything mundo! The scallops, the guacamole, the liquid pleasure martini, and anything alien tequila.they make bomb alien margaritas! Tres leches dessert! I love you chef!
Went in today to see Dr Biggs after being in severe pain for two days. First I need to mention I have anxiety and going to the dentist causes me major discomforts. I've been there once specifically to meet him in person and he was really cool and relaxed. His staff is just WONDERFUL! Everybody seems to be so calm and comforting. His office is super clean and organized and it doesn't looks terrifying like dentists office usually do. 

So today I had to overcome my fear and anxiety and give him a shot. I read a few reviews that mentioned "pain free root canal" and I thought that could not be possible. IT IS!
The only part that wasn't the greatest was numbing but he managed to make me laugh with his stories and his assistant was a really funny lady as well, reassuring me I'd be ok and always checking on me.
I kid you not, I felt absolutely nothing! Reviews don't lie!! This guy is a miracle and I wish everybody that has to go through a root canal treatment would give him a try. It is PAINLESS. Not even a little discomfort, nothing!
I had some root canals before and that's why I was so nervous but I was wrong... it was a pleasant experience and I was able to laugh instead of panic! He was also really attentive explaining me what he was doing when I would ask about a certain noise or instrument. Explained to me to whole post care and what I should do next.
I highly recommend him to EVERYONE!
For my two night stay (12\/29, 12\/30):

I got in line for check-in at 2:43 and had my room key by 3:02, which wasn't fast but wasn't as horrifying as some of the stories I have heard.  The clerk was slightly too curt, but she did her job thoroughly.

We were on the 17th floor facing the pools and did not hear any construction or noise the entire time, other than some strange tapping from another room a couple times the last night.

The room was almost well cleaned when we checked in (I found a clothing sticker and bandaid, but they weren't obvious).  The towels were very stiff and had a burnt smell to them (like they were in the dryer too long), while my mother felt her bed linens\/pillows had an "off" scent to them (I did not smell anything strange regarding mine).

Maid service was adequate, with the room cleaned every day with no problems.  I brought my own pillow (theirs are the usual awful soft ones), but do wish they had a comforter or heavier blanket option (it was very cold).  On that same note, the air conditioning is a relatively modern wall vent with a digital display.

The water pressure in the shower was AMAZING.  I cannot praise it enough, it basically solidified their fourth star.  The multiple Starbucks also helped them earn kudos.

I'll my review of their fully furnished but lackluster fitness center (inside\/past the spa) in the spa and salon's page.  Watch out for it closing early (6pm)!

Watch out for pushy manipulative salespeople in the Street of Dreams!

Check out the gift shop for Monte Carlo and Las Vegas logo goods.  You do get a discount with your mLife card, though I think the somewhat strange (talked to stuffed animals) older female cashier stiffed me (it looks like she didn't apply the discount to all the items).  The MC goods might even become collectibles if the hotel does change its name...

Besides the initial clerk, all the other employees of the hotel were very friendly and professional, including the maid, concierges, bellhop, and valet employees.
There was one concierge who printed my "will call" tickets for Ka at MGM Grand for me and offered excellent directions via two different routes, complete with a map.

Their location is fantastic, sandwiched between two higher-end resorts (Aria and Bellagio, with other neighbors including Cosmopolitan, Vdara, and Mandarin Oriental).  Thanks to the free tram that arrives every 6 or so minutes, you can easily enjoy the amenities of the more luxurious neighbors (and charge all the MGM-owned Resorts to your room too).  It's slightly more difficult to cross the street, as it involves walking until you get to a pedestrian bridge or crosswalk.

It is not as new and shiny as its neighbors, and thus is a little worn and showing its age (peeling wallpaper, awful cracked seat coverings for the food court chairs), but I feel it is reasonably well maintained.

I've never stayed here before, so I'm not aware of how prevalent its original theme was.  Right now it comes across as generic fancy European.  The stained glass and ornate cast\/molded ceilings are nice though.

Overall: Occupies a niche solidly above the likes of Excalibur and Circus Circus but below its immediate neighbors (Aria, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan).  My mother loved it here!  (I think she's used to the lower end or family-focused places)  I've already booked a second stay, so here's hoping the next stay goes just as well!
Seriously awesome Thai food!  My wife and I really enjoyed this gem of a restaurant.  Friendly staff, inexpensive, casual dress, and my wife claims it's the best Yellow Curry she's ever had.  We will definitely come back before heading back to our home state.
We had a reservation there a few weeks ago and were seated right away.  Service was attentive -at first. We got our drinks, went straight to the entrée. After that, our server wasn't very present. The chicken Marsala was pretty good; however, the pasta carbonara was very rich. My friend ordered it and I felt overwhelmed after two bites. Dessert was wonderful -we got the lobster tail and it was decadent. Great flavor and texture. The pit of night was when our waitress, Kacey, dropped the bill and told us the gratuity was already added so all we had to do was pay the total noted at the bottom. 
  The problem there was that we were a party of 3. We looked at the bill and printed directly on there was something along the lines of:
"No gratuity has been added to your bill. For your convenience, here are some preset gratuity amounts, just circle the one you'd like to apply.
- 15%
- 18%
- 20%
- 22%"

Kacey had circled the 20% option and wrote the new total at the bottom because I guess she thought that that was what she deserved. After she dropped the bill, we noticed she was constantly circling our table, waiting for us to provide a method of payment. We were a party of 3 and even though we are young (early 20s) we know how to tip. It was pretty insulting. I get it, you work in the heart of Vegas where many international visitors aren't aware of the customs. But that doesn't mean assume everybody is like that. After talking it over amongst ourselves, I got her attention and pointed out what the receipt stated and said that if it says that, then the gratuity amount should really be up to our discretion. She tried to cover it all up by saying something like, "Oh, that was just a suggested amount, if it's that big of a deal I can just take it off." And she ripped off the bottom of the check. 
  I've worked in the restaurant industry and servers face heavy disciplinary action for that type of behavior. We still left a tip but the whole ordeal really just left a bad taste in our mouths.
Que ce soit ans un magasin style Winners ou bien une friperie...chercher un morceau de vêtement qui soit parfait..mettons que ce n'est pas dans mon top 10 de mes activités favorites. Ceci étant dit, pour l'Halloween...j'adore me déguisé avec des vêtements de friperie et me concevoir un costume pas trop cher. 

En ayant vu les nouvelles pubs de Renaissance et de l'Halloween, je me suis dit que je devrais aller là et qu'il avait d'l'air à avoir beaucoup de choix. 

Dès qu'on rentre, on sent cette fameuse odeur de vieux vêtements qu'on sent dans toutes les magasins à grandes surfaces de vêtements usées. Une odeur de garde-robe\/poussière\/sensation bizarre quand tu touches les vêtements bref..En rentrant dans le magasin, la section Halloween était là. Il ne restait pas grand chose, même s'il restait au moins 6 jours pour le 31. On voyait que les accessoires  avaient eu du succès et qu'il ne restait pas grand chose. Je me suis donc mis à chercher dans la section de vêtements pour m'inspirer....sorcière...vieille dame...folle au chat....je ne savais pas...je ne trouvais rien... Il y avait vraiment beaucoup trop de monde partout...un méga line up pour les cabines d'essayage et pour payer...Je me croyais au Zara en période de méga solde. Finalement, je suis tombé sur une jupe longue magnifique bohemienne. Certes je vais là garder  et la porter un jour...et j'ai eu l'idée de Hippie. Je me suis donc mis à chercher des accessoires et un chandail qui pourrait compléter mon costume. Une vingtaine de minutes plus tard, et j'avais terminé mes achats un beau gros 20$ pour un costume et accessoires.
There isn't a better place to workout then here. Not over crowded, great people, fun environment. Nothing better!!!!
I love Costa Vida. Their salads are delicious, it must be the fresh tortillas that are layered on the bottom.Customer service is great and the food is consistently good. My only issue with this restaurant is when you are nickel and dimed for things like sour cream, extra dressing, etc...I'm not a fan of that. But the pros outweigh the cons and I will continue to eat here.
Overall disappointing. Ate here with a chinese guest who remarked on the dryness of the peking duck, whose skin also lacked that magical quality that you would expect. For the price, it was a total let down. Other dishes were decent but portions once again do not justify the price. No way i would go again.
At last a nice non-chain coffee shop on Monkland! Coffee is excellent. If you never had Forty Ninth Parallel coffee before, you have to try it. Staff was cool, place looks nice and also they have a small outdoor seating area. What more to ask?
My washer broke from my apartments down the street. Anyhow Oasis I highly recommend... Steve is a great guy best service I've had in a while is why I'm even on here writing this review! Thanks STEVE!!
I wanted to update my review because the manager messaged me on Yelp inviting me back to the restaurant. I appreciate the fact that they are concerned with their customers feedback. Hopefully they will use the customer feedback and implement the necessary changes that should be made. They could start with either lowering their menu prices or purchasing higher quality product. I don't mind paying top dollar for top quality, but that is not what is offered here. I am not looking for a free meal. I just give honest feedback to inform other consumers. So, I want to be clear about why I gave them two stars on my review.

I would give them five stars if the review was just based on their staff. The service was excellent. The staff is very friendly and attentive to the customers, as demonstrated by the manager showing concern about my review. The kitchen staff did a fine job on the preparation and the presentation of the food. I was disappointed with the quality of the product used in the perpetration. The prime rib in the sandwich and the meat in the burgers were not up to par. The chicken wings were average at best and extremely over priced for what you are served. Personally, I don't care for some of the flavor combinations on the menu.

I want to be very clear about the fact that the kitchen staff cooked the food properly and presented it as they were supposed to. It was the quality of the product I gave two stats to, not the service or the preparation.

I think my expectations of the food before I arrived led me to be so disappointed with the food. It is just average food though. It was not a bad meal and none of the food tasted bad. If the prices were not so high, I may have given them three stats. It is just not worth the money. The burgers are definitely not up to par with the likes of LBS, Bacchi Burger, and Gordon Ramsay Burger. I would even say Smash Burger and Fat Burger serves better tasting burgers.

To be fair, I will conclude by suggesting that you give them a try and make your own decision on the quality and taste of the menu items.
I've tried several of their dishes at this Flo's location and they've been all good.  What keeps me coming back again and again is their hot and sour soup~ made fresh, full of flavor with large pieces of white chicken meat and large shrimps.  Usually, when I am feeling under the weather, like today, I stop by Flo's for a quick "pick me up" of their aromatic and delicious hot and sour soup and after consuming the large bowl, big enough for four people, I felt better and left a happy customer~ along with a to go order of wonton soup to nurse my coughing throat for later on in the day.
Cute cafe in the area. Items a bit on the pricer side for what they are, but quality is decent. Decor is charming, best described as the more "instagramable" Aroma but with full meal options.
Loved the place's decor, the way it's all set up. The servers are so kind and friendly, now having said that the food, well I ordered the BBQ Brisket and my daughter ordered the Beef Rib. Both of our meats were so tender no need for a knife, the flavoring was mouth watering. Now rhe homemade bread was dry, the sides well it could of been better, the pickles were ok but the cabbage was way to spicy. Mind you thats great for people who like it like that, but for mostwho doesn't well it was painful. I also ordered rhe Broccoli side with cranberries and peanuts, it was very bland. I would go nack now but I will be mindful about the sides
There is no better DJ to have at your wedding than Leland! He was awesome to work with and helped me out immensely with all my questions.   He kept the party alive and played all the right songs. He listened to my crazy requests, i.e. no chicken dance, no electric slide, and no certain artists ; he kept the party fun all night! 

Leland thanks so much for all you did.  Everyone raved about what a great time they had, thank you again!!!!!
If you like Olive Garden, you'll like this place. 

The Italian cuisine is delicious. The bread is very fresh and the garlic butter dip is very tasty. The wedding soup is quite good and filling. The portion sizes are very large but I liked that the menu had a section specifying "for smaller meals" in case you're not that hungry. The appetizers were great. We got the platter to try a little bit of everything from the appetizer list. The atmosphere is very cute. A little fountain, some Christmas lights, a dim lit environment. It's a relaxing feeling.
This place was recommended by someone at work so I thought for sure it would be good, but I wasn't all that impressed. The atmosphere and décor is just trying way too hard to be retro and hipster. Im pretty sure you have to have an arm sleeve or at least 4 visible tattoos and 2 facial piercings to work there, but the service was over all pretty good. Drinks were refilled very quickly and the food was brought out promptly. Although, my boyfriend and I came in on an early sunday afternoon and were sat next to a huge group of loud women getting drunk which seemed like a poor choice considering the place wasn't half full. Even the way too loud music couldnt drown out the ladies having a good ol time. The food itself was good, just not anything more than that. We got the tuna for an app and it tasted like it wasn't very good quality. The enchilada wasn't that impressive either. Not sure if we will give this place a second chance, despite hearing good things about it from coworkers.
Love thier chocolate covered fruits!  All thier fruit is always fresh, love this place!!!!
This place is pretty nice for kind of a trendy sports\/ divery bar. This place is gonna take some describing so bare with me. You enter through a door in the corner of the bar where you first see an ATM (hint hint) and then find some seating to your right and the bar straight ahead. As you walk towards the bar, the place kind of bottlenecks where you find the stairs to an upstairs, the door the outdoor patio and lots of bar height tables. 

The bar is runs almost the length of the building then wraps around a bit near the kitchen. BTW they make some GREAT bar food especially a patty melt that was soo good I ordered it immediately the next time I went. Anywho... They have a TON of draft beers and a TON of different liquors. Great big TV's right at the bar to be able to watch any game you want and then they also have a massive projection screen for some of the bigger games as well and to watch from upstairs.They also have some of the most friendly staff I have ever met in my entire life. THEY ARE GREAT! Great doesn't even describe it. They're jubilant! Yeah, that's right your learning new words!

Anyways, Moving on to the upstairs, They have a pool table A SECOND smaller bar and another set of TV's! They also have darts and lots more seating up their. On most nights the upstairs is nice and quiet and not crowed at all so you can usually sneak in a couple games of pool and darts. Oh and this place is usually pretty clean but its a dive bar so spills can happen. Finally the outdoor patio wraps around the back of the bar just a tad and has some nice tables to sit at as well. Jeez, with all the seating you could sit a small town in there and it doesn't seem like that big of a building. Like I said it has some great staff, a nice building, and lots of seating. And great patty melts.. mmmm ok thats it i'm going to get one when i'm done with this review. Get on down there to watch some good sports, and eat and drink well without busting the bank. Watch out for the daily specials too!
The service is exceptionally good here. Our waitstaff was very personable, friendly and worked hard to make sure we were having an enjoyable experience. The food is excellent and they have some good week day specials. Best atmosphere in Markham.
I have tried al pastor at other places it is never as good as Grullo's. 
I have been getting take out there 4 or more times a month since they opened, that says a lot. Love the chorizo breakfast plate and the taco combo plate. I do miss the avocado slices.  It is my favorite take out place. The owners are always so nice and friendly.
I love Vegas! I try to stay and experience a different hotel on the strip every time I visit. I'm surprised it took me this long to stay at the MGM Grand. I've always said I was going to, I made sure this time I did, and I'm very happy I did.

We stayed on the 25th floor. The room was excellent. Very spacious. I was very impressed with the amount of space in the room. From the pictures online, I didn't think it would be as much space as it was. I'm happy that it was. The bed was ultra comfortable, once you laid down, you didn't want to get back up! The views of outside were great, especially at night when all the other hotels on the strip are lit up. 

The casino has tons or table games to partake in. I'm not much of a slot person, but if you enjoy those there's plenty here to play on. The sports book is one of the better looking ones I've been too. Tons of televisions for you to catch all the action.

The staff here was very good. It was a long line to check in, but that was expected with it being on a Friday and a big UFC match happening that next day, so it wasn't a big deal to me. The front desk staff was working hard to get everyone checked in quickly. The line move pretty quick based on the amount of people in line. We also had a problem with our iron in our room. We called the front desk and someone brought a new one up immediately. I was also greeted with a lot of hello and hi's from the staff when walking around the hotel. 

The MGM Grand is a great hotel. I love the location of it, tons of cool and fun things in pretty close walking distance. Once I complete my quest of staying in all the nice hotels on the strip, MGM Grand will probably be my go to hotel to stay at when visiting Las Vegas.
I agree with the below poster.  I like Giant Eagle because they have everything someone needs.  They accept double coupons, have fuel perks, and are just the local grocery chain.  Sometimes a store is hit or miss depending upon the location, but I am satisfied with Giant Eagle and will do my grocery shopping there.
I might be biased, since one of my friends is in the show, but I went to see it twice and enjoyed it both times.  Being a musician based in Vegas means getting an almost constant overload of (at times) cliche pop and rock tunes, so this show is such a great relief from all of that.  I wish there were more shows like this in Vegas - or anywhere, for that matter.  You get pretty equal treatment of all the three main members of the Rat Pack, and the video at the beginning gives you a little bit of Vegas and Rat Pack history.  If you have a good sense of humor, you'll laugh at the hijinks that are interspersed throughout.  Recommended for Vegas locals, or all of you tourists.
Oh yum. So yummy. Scene: Monday night happy hour at the bar with my friend Steve, who recently celebrated a birthday. 

I had the salmon burger--it was cooked just right (medium rare) and came with asparagus and red tomato slices, and had a spiced mayo-esque sauce on it. A helping of what seemed to be homemade potato chips rode shotgun--tasty when dipped in the tangy tamarind sauce that came with Steve's fried calamari. He also ordered the (New England) clam chowder. I asked for a slurp and Steve obliged. After slurping, I silently resolved to get a bowl the next time I'm at this establishment--it was perfect. Not too thick. My father would have flipped his wig. And he preferred Manhattan clam chowder. 

We shared a mocha cake for dessert that came with dollop of berry sorbet and a good-sized shaving of chocolate on top.  

Curtis, the gracious bartender, not only offered a recommendation on desserts for the occasion, but also brought us out a dish of three or four chocolate-covered strawberries after I mentioned it was Steve's birthday. I'll say it again: Curtis--you are a gentleman and a scholar.
Seriously this place is a hidden gem. The place is clean the food was so good the chef is so polite and his food is just so great. If you ever near kams corner i suggest you stop by for a very filling very good meal
Went in on a whim and was not disappointed. I had the ODB and my husband had the poutine. Poutine was good...had pulled chicken on it and was tasty, although not entirely unique tasting, but that's fine for this type of place. I had the ODB and it was AMAZE-BALLS! The chicken was a huge portion, on a full waffle. The waffle was the perfect blend of sweetness, with just a bit of syrup and the chicken was crispy and great and so tender it just flaked apart. It had a great sauce on top and the slight kick, blended with the sweetness of the waffle, was a great mix. Portion size was good, food was delicious. Came with a little cup of potato salad...liked the peas, nice touch and the potato salad was a refreshing touch for the whole dish. Still thinking about it hours later....thinking and thinking....*sigh*
The phenomenal staff here has earned the five stars. This location is for obvious reasoning, genius actually since it is prime for the Hoover Dam crowd. Pit stop for a restroom break-by many I'm sure. Myself included. 
However, I ordered one of those new seasonal drinks and it was not my taste.  The staff immediately noticed my facial expression and corrected all!  They even sized me
Up to a grande at no extra charge. Yes, clearly I can never resist the cake pops. I ordered a seasonal cake pop-dark chocolate, white chocolate with peppermint candy! 
This location's space is quite sizable inside, corner spot and a great patio size.  It's a constant revolving door here, I watched MANY people simply come in and use the restroom only. One staff member was always checking on the cleanliness of their restrooms.  Another restocking the menu items and another cleaning those tables.  
The entire Starbucks team here were all
Smiles:)
The best part about the meal was how cheap it was. 

I was pretty disappointed that they were out of both their vegetarian dumpling fillings (it was about 7pm on a Tuesday night). I ended up ordering a large hot&sour soup and enviously glaring at my friend's dumplings.The soup was great but nothing to call home about. I also tried out the spicy bean curd which was difficult to eat and lacking in excitement. 

The service was best described as hostile. What struck me was how slow they were to clear up our dishes. It was also cash-only that night so I wouldn't go in expecting to pay with card.
Just opened down the street from me in Waverly . Very crowded but we had a party of 7 and did get seated fairly quick. The Chips are thin and hot and good ! Table Salsa was fresh and spicy !  Guacamole was lacking and flavoring and mostly chopped lettuce .  The Chili Rellenos were wonderful ! Big and Crisply fried - 2 in the order. I had the Cheese filled ones and I loved them ! Tacos were good, could have had a bit more meat . The Regular Margarita was plain an needed more lime. I will go back again !!  For Tex Mex it was very good !
Decent food (had the breakfast burrito, which was delightfully pressed on the grill and crispy), great location, but some of the worst live music I've ever heard in my life, right up there with some wedding reception noise!  The restaurant was full and ONE person, an employee who seemed to be the singer's girlfriend, applauded.  Dead silence from everyone else.  For several songs.  It was really bad.  I actually had the waiter change my order to takeout, but thankfully the "musician" packed up soon after that.  The poor server apologized, and said they're working on the noise level, but I think they need to look at the talent level instead.  If I hear\/see that awful LOUD caterwauling they call live entertainment again when I enter here, I will immediately turn around and leave.

This experience was actually from my second time in the restaurant.  My first time I walked in I was ignored, there was no one at the hostess stand area, and there was a bored looking waitress rolling silverware and pretending I wasn't looking at the menus.  I walked out after a bit.

Two strikes means I've yet to go back, since Los Tacquitos on 16th Street and Glendale is just as close, much faster, and the women working there (owners?) give great customer service.  Their quality probably isn't as high as Otro, but neither are their prices.
im a huge starbucks drinker i can't start my day without it. now i decided to go to this location i will never ever go there again the barista who was making my drink was so rude i have a specific drink and she had the nerve to tell me how it is! !!!! i pay a lot for my drink i will never do this place again. if you want your drink done wrong and a rude person telling you how you should have it then go right ahead
Okay, so my rating has gone down from the first time I went here. 

I came again, with my family, for my birthday, at the beginning of October. Even though we had a reservation, our table wasn't ready. We were finally seated and the waiter introduced himself...and then disappeared. Came back ten minutes later and took drink orders and then disappeared for 15 minutes...this continued the entire time. Our dinner took A LONG time. It took forever for our drinks to be served and even longer for our food to come out. Then when the food came out, we got two plates and then waited five minutes for one more plate...then waited another five minutes for another plate. It took our group 15 minutes just for us all to receive the food! Obviously we couldn't eat until everyone had been served and the food was getting cold at that point.

Oh, the best part?? Someone mentioned it was my birthday and the waiter said, "Oh, so you're a January baby," indicating to when I was conceived...to my parents. Yes...thank you sir. I would really like to be reminded of my parents' doing it, right before dinner...because that's completely appropriate. 

So yes, the service this time was TERRIBLE! 

BUT, everyone enjoyed their food and thought it was really good, so there ya have it. Service hit or miss, but food is good.
I love coming to Elevation! I currently work in the Henry W. Oliver Building with the Embassy Suites, and it's the perfect little place to grab lunch! I have only visited Elevation for lunch and it has never been crowded. The waiter (most likely Dan) is a character and makes sure you're well taken care of. Unfortunately I haven't been able to veer from the Chicken Bacon Avocado Sandwich, but the two times I had it, it's been more than delicious! Their fries are fresh cut and come with some seasoning on them - almost like an Old Bay seasoning, but not real strong. My co-worker always gets the Shrimp Tacos and she loves them! They are sesame shrimp and there's usually about 2-3 shrimp on the taco. I also came here with another co-worker who ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad for lunch and it was a pretty big serving with plenty of chicken pieces! They also mentioned that the cheddar broccoli soup was delicious!

I'm convinced there isn't a bad meal at this restaurant and the atmosphere is modern and sleek. However, The booths sit a little far from the tables, I had to sit on the very edge of the booth while I ate. I hear the tables in the back by the windows are the best with the view! The waiter is a little intruding at times, but he means well!

Overall, it's a very nice restaurant to visit, especially during lunch being that you're most likely to be one of 3-5 parties there, so your food is brought out pretty quickly. And pricing isn't bad for the quality and quantity that you receive!
The Living Room is my kind of place!  The dark setting, candles, open space, the vibe, the crowd.....am I still in Chandler?  Where did these people come from?  

A friend and I went on Friday at around 7pm and the place was packed.  There was some confusion at the door, since there's not a "hostess stand" indicating that you are to wait to be seated.  We were seated within 15 minutes.  Immediately, we noticed the music was just a tad too loud.  I loved the mix, but yes, a tad too loud.  

We started with the bruschetta, which was delicious!  Plenty as a starter for two.  I had the mixed greens salad and it was just that....mixed greens.  Kind of boring but the greens were fresh and the dressing was light.  My friend had the chicken salad sandwich and butternut squash soup, and while she raved about the soup she was less than impressed with the sandwich.  

All in all, I definitely want to come back and enjoy happy hour since this is close to home for me.  What a great new addition to Chandler!
Love this concept! Great prices and food is as good as you make it because you can customize your pizza and add toppings for no additional charge!! Pizzas are and around $8 and they taste great. Love that it's fast and affordable. Second time dining here and it's a new fav!
We have been going here for a couple of years and find our experience has been inconsistent. The first time we came, we enjoyed everything we loved the large pieces of kimchi that you cut at your table and LA kalbi and hotpot we ordered was very good. Then the following time we came the food was not as good but we decided to still come back and to our surprise we had a better experience again. So we continued coming here. We find the menu keeps changing which is nice but on our last visit we thought the prices that they charged for their dishes was unreasonable. The food was good for the most part but not the best and the portions were small. Also this time the kimchi was tasteless. Also they only gave us 3 banchan. We ordered the kimchi stew and it was a tiny bowl which you would expect as a complimentary size and it was $11.95. Then we got the seafood pancake which was $18.95 and nothing special. The most disappointing dish was the deep fried chicken in hot pepper sauce. It comes in 2 sizes and we got the small size for the 2 of us and it was a size for 1 person and the cost was $16.95. Don't think we will back until we see better reviews.
So glad my friend suggested this restaurant for dinner! The food was so good and so was the service! We ordered the jerk chicken poutine, salted fish and ackee, and oxtail dinner. All were delicious! The jerk chicken was flavourful and juicy. My favourite was the oxtail, perfectly cooked. I have my eye on the mussels in curry for my next visit. It was constantly busy while we were there for an early dinner on a Saturday night. It is a small restaurant, so I suggest making reservations.
The short summary? I now officially love FLW and the tour I took convinced me to get a membership the next time I go back. 

Two friends and I wandered here a few months ago to get our culture on. We took the 90 minute guided tour I believe. Everything was so gorgeous and our tour guide was extremely knowledgeable. He was able to not just preach at us with lines he'd rehearsed over and over again, but tell a story and show how this knowledge applies to life today. 

We were able to take pictures during this tour which doesn't happen in a lot of museums these days and I took everything i could until my camera died. 

I left feeling completely inspired and awaiting my next visit.
Today was my first time dining in Toronto's new Four Seasons, and I must say I was rather underwhelmed.

We arrived around 11 for an early lunch and were brought to our table. The decor is relatively modern, although it is starting to look a bit tired and shabby. Most of the chairs were starting to show quite a bit of wear on the fabric armrests and you could see that there was chipped paint on a number of their cabinets. 

The servers were pleasant and unobtrusive, but I got the sense that they did not exactly go out of their way to cater to the diners. Spoons were dropped, water refills could have been more frequent, etc.

For drinks we just had a coffee and a tea during lunch, and a cappuccino at the end of the meal. Both the coffee and tea arrived with small cookies on the saucer, but the cappuccino did not come with one. It was surprising to me that the green tea came with a biscuit while a cappuccino did not as you would be more likely to expect one with the cappuccino. The cappuccino also took an extremely long time to arrive. The server actually had to go back to check on it because it was so slow to arrive. We were joking that they must be milking their own cows and growing their own beans! I will note that the coffee and tea were both served as pots of coffee and pots of tea, which was appreciated.

We ordered two smoked salmon salads and a small lobster salad without the coconut.

The lobster salad was a decent portion and came with a small lobster-filled samosa. The flavour of the samosa filling was yummy, but the shell was overcooked and rather greasy. The salad is dressed in a very light vinaigrette and comes with some drops of aioli on the plate. I did not like the aioli and would have preferred the dish without it. There are also whole peppercorns pre-sprinkled over top of the salad, so be cautious if you are sensitive to pepper!

The smoked salmon salads were also enjoyed and they came with a bit of caviar sprinkled throughout as well as some large crisps of some sort on top. A lot of frisée is used, so if you don't like frisée, you may want to avoid this dish. One of my dining companions noted that they thought the salad could use a bit more dressing.

The bathrooms are a bit odd. They are located in the basement and are not wheelchair accessible. If you require wheelchair accessible washrooms, you have to take the elevator up a floor. Once inside the washroom, there are individual stalls with floor-to-ceiling doors and walls. The stalls themselves are quite dim, and I expected a light to come on automatically (I thought they might be motion-sensored), but both my dining companions had the same experience (in both the men's and ladies washrooms).

Overall the experience was adequate, but I would not rush back to dbar. There are many other restaurants in the area where you would receive better good and service at the same price point.
24 hour bowling on 64 lanes with a bar that serves cheap drinks. Awesome.

$3.25 for each game, $2.75 for shoe rental. Come before 6pm and its $3.00 a game.

Friendly staff.

This update is way over due!! Last month I had my nails done by Brenda and she was so awesome and the only reason I'm giving 5 stars. Still disappointed that this spa doesn't offer a better color selection for the prices and still no glitter or fun things to add to nails. But Brenda was so sweet and very easy to converse with!
Have had such bad experiences here and my wife and I are now looking for another dentist. Cleanings shouldn't feel like root canals and every time I'm there, I feel like I'm on canal street because they're trying to always sell you on the extras. Not a good practice at all. I do not recommend.
Si vous lisez mes reviews, vous savez que je suis une fan de Bouffe Haïtienne...et en ayant habité dans le hood et Rdp..j'ai essayé pas mal d'endroits...et même le "meilleur" casse-croûte au metro Jarry. 

Mais ce resto WOW il a un je ne sais quoi....tu sais genre d'endroit où les gens sont content de te voir. .que même si l'endroit n'a pas de décor design de fou...c'est un endroit où tu as envie de rester et où sa sent HYPER BON. Bref...tout ça pour te dire que quand j'ai ouvert ma boîte en styromousse j'ai eu des larmes de joie..Une assiette belle...coloré.. appétissante...Enfin dans un plat de griot il y avait des salades qui étaient appétissante et pas seulement une feuille de laitue avec de la sauce française sans nom.  J'ai aussi goûter un truc donc j'ai oublié le nom...une entrée ben graisseuse...bref ben bon. Le bouillon est écoeurant...demandé extra sauce! La salade de pâte mmmiam et le riz collée...excellent et frais. Le griot...est très bon et n'est pas fulll graise. Bref...quand on mange de la qualité et de la propreté c'est un peu plus cher...alors 12$ pour un grand...mais rassure-toi il va t'en rester pour ton lunch ou pour manger plus tard...bref c'est 2 plats en 1. 

Et dernière chose...je vous conseille d'appeler avant pour qu'on vous prépare votre plat d'avance...aussi il y a des photos de Jean Pascal qui a été là ...alors s'il y va je trust la place!
Bravo, Whisky Shop! I have been timid about entering you, for I know about as much as a wicker platypus does about whisky. I don't drink, you see, and even when I did, whisky wasn't my tipple.

I came in here once before in search of some Caol Ila for my brother for Christmas, which he had specifically mentioned by name. I was too shy to say anything so I scootled around, nosing at the shelves, and being unable to see it (but seriously, there are SO MANY BOTTLES), I fled.

This time, however, I didn't have a name, just the vague notion that I wanted a Lowland whisky, ideally made near to Edinburgh, that wasn't too peaty, as a good luck gift for a friend who was leaving town. I braced myself, and stepped inside.

"Hello," I said, in the bracingly chipper manner of someone who has resolved to do something, a bit like people in films introduce themselves at AA. "My name is Cressida and I know nothing about whisky."

The chap (and I regret I didn't make a note of his name) didn't blink, and his friendly expression didn't waver. "Sure," he smiled. "What are you looking for?"

I told him my specification and right away he knew exactly what to recommend. He showed me a range of bottles and explained the differences in how they were made and the effect that it had on the flavour, and - this is the great bit - let me know the price of each. I hate it when you get the details and have to shiftily go "and... how much is that one? And that one?"

This was a chap who clearly knew his stuff, not just a bored employee bleeping bottles through the till to turn a buck. While we talked, I suddenly spotted a bottle of Caol Ila! Wow! I mentioned it to him and he explained that this one was the rare and pretty expensive 18-year version, and probably not what my brother had tried in Sandy Bell's. I had a look all the same (then hastily put it back when I saw the price).

So, in short - my misgivings about the location (bland Princes Mall) and the shop itself (chain) were allayed by this simple process: whisky specified, whiskies identified, whiskies explained, whisky selected, whisky purchased. No fuss, no judgement, and altogether a very happy experience with good conversation thrown in. Here's to you, Whisky Shop. I raise my apple juice to your good health.
My friends and I were out late and we decided we wanted to try to find a place with reverse happy hour on a Saturday night.  Went online to yelp and found FEZ that was close to where we were, call the restaurant and was told indeed they have reverse happy hour on Saturday night from 10pm-12am.
Perfect!  Love the atmosphere, the waiter was attentive- didn't get annoyed when I changed my drink order from wine to water and joked around with us.
There were four of us.  Three of us had the lettuce wrap which was delish!  The lettuce wrap came with 5 stalks of Romaine lettuce and the chicken was mixed with cranberries, dried apricot, dates, almonds- absolutely filled with flavor.  Generous portions- enough to be a meal.  The fourth person had their chicken sandwich which was also delish.  
We thoroughly enjoyed our drinks and our food and would definitely go back there again!
A definite must for vegan eats. Their BBQ "chicken" wings are yummy. Hubby liked his Thai peanut bowl with brown rice. Garlic hummus was VERY garlicky. I wouldn't order it again probably. But we will be back!
I wish i saw the reviews before I made an appointment. They have a local number and a 888 number. I made an appointment for the next day and was supposed to be between 10 to 12pm but since i was stuck at work i rescheduled for 1 to 3pm, which i thought great service, right? I called them to make sure they knew I needed my white sofa cleaned, it just had dust and needed a refreasher. Nothing heavily stained and my carpet was just cleaned 6 months ago. The manager Jonathan said he sent the best guy they had for white furniture CJ was the guy. Had my adult child wait for CJ, while I was still at work. My kid calls and puts CJ on the phone, he proceeded to inform me that the 59.00 4 room carpet cleaning and 49.00 upholstery cleaning is now $421 becuase theres a lot of heavy stains. Now im annoyed, I said dont touch the carpet, how much for the sofa and chair, he says $150. I had him clean the sofa and of course its now ruined. 

I called them back to complain and they tell me theyre sending this CJ back to assess the problem and they wont have time till tomorrow. What? He is the problem, the company is the problem, they rip people off. They come to your home and tell you a ridiculous amount and try to make more deals. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!! 

They text me with this number 702.381.2120 but they have me call this number 888.233.7613
We had the screen on my sons phone fixed today.(bummer) We went to Store #3.  They were fantastic and very fast. The phone looks brand new.
Why the hell did no one drag me to Ticoz before now? Seriously, you all call yourselves my friends? I'm disappointed and saddened everyone kept this secret to themselves.

As usual I was craving breakfast this morning and was able to convince the amazing Tony A. to meet me somewhere. He recommended Ticoz. I will go out on a limb and say this probably ties for one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Similar to Bri D., I am practice a non-tomato diet, and therefore, usually have issues with many places I eat at. I suspected I would have to order everything today minus tomato. However, I was clearly wrong.

Let's start with the salsa and chips. For brunch. Yum. One of the salsas was pineapple based, which in itself would've made me completely content. Had my breakfast not arrived in a timely fashion I would've asked for them to take the other two away and replace it with three bowls of the pineapple salsa. Establishments that can make a great salsa without the use of tomatoes are hard to find. Along with my salsa and chips (I swear I didn't eat the salsa only with a spoon despite my desire to) I had a $2 mimosa. Yep. Only $2. It was super fantastic and had minimal amount of pulp which I also appreciate, not to mention that it looked sunshiny and happy.

I went with the huevos rancheros for breakfast, which is comprised of 3 eggs any way you like, green chili, pulled pork, and potatoes. Um, please Sir, may I have another? It was one of those just about perfectly sized meals (had I not front loaded on salsa and chips) that made me all happy inside as I consumed it. The server told me it would be spicy. It did have a kick, but a little more of one would've been welcome.

Stepping away from the food, the service was prompt and the staff was super friendly from the moment I walked in the door before I could take my sunglasses off until I was headed out the door on my way home. Very conversational. Very prompt. Very much appreciated. The prices were also extremely reasonable. Although the menu for brunch is limited, at least half the items appealed to me, which means there is hope of a future trip.

I adored the laid back decor which was perfect on a Sunday morning. The colors were warm and inviting and the seating was creative. The bigger chairs at the table though almost don't work for short people, but I managed. I want to go back again. Now.
I hate it when nail salons lie about the wait time, just to get you to stay. After being told 10-15 minutes, I gave up after waiting 20 mins because I knew the next available technician was still 5-10 minutes away from finishing her other client ahead of me (which would have resulted in a 25-30 min wait for me). Be honest about your wait time; if it's too long, I'll come back-- and I'll appreciate your honestly because it shows you respect my time. If you're dishonest about the wait (because I truly believe you know how long it'll take you to finish up a service), then you lose regular customers like myself.
By far the best stripclub I've been to in Vegas. 
The club is not a huge place but it's extremely comfortable and it looks really nice, nice decoration and lighting. The club is very clean,  it has organized bathrooms, clean VIP rooms, chairs always in the right place.

You can drink alcohol while enjoying the fully nude ladies dancing.
 
They offer transportation service, which is really good, we used it twice and both drivers were really friendly and arrived shortly after we called.
I've also used the valley service and the guy is really nice and fast.
I've always been greeted nicely by the men who stand by the door, they were always polite when asking for Ids and when we had questions.
The girls that work at the bar are awesome and they're always checking in on you, making sure you always have a drink when you want one, theyre super friendly and smiley. The drinks are good and have fair prices.

As for the dancers, I must say they are absolutely gorgeous. Some girls performances are breathtaking, specially those who are really good at pole dancing. They're creative and always wear cute outfits. Some of them could smile more tho and interact with the customers but if you approach them, they'll take good care of you. The only sad fact is most of them seem to be uncomfortable with couples, and girls. Understandable, and they're still nice if approached.

The only one thing I strongly dislike is that some girls have the tendency of approaching us by my husband. I've worked with customer service and aggressive sales for a long time and we were always advised to approach the lady when you're dealing with a couple, to avoid causing her to feel uncomfortable with you, I think they should consider doing the same. 

I had a few lap dances from different ladies and they're all really sweet and sexy, they know what they're doing, and they will always wait for a song to start to give you the lap dance, they will be talking to you all the time - which made me feel very comfortable.

The VIP room I visited twice, my first time was a dream, the lady was great at listening to what I expected and she was just perfect! She was sitting with us for a while and explained me clearly about the rules when I decided to go upstairs.The second time, I was disappointed, this other girl was very attractive  but pushy and we ended up going upstairs but she told me different rules when we got upstairs, after we paid for her time and dances.

If you're a visitor or a local, this is a great place with both, great customer service and beautiful beautiful girls, I strongly recommend this place.
I like the Short Rib Dinner Plate here. It's decent for one of those days you want some roast beef, but too lazy to cook a whole chuck yourself. The tostones would have been awesome if there's some extra sauce to eat it with. I tried the chicken, and it was too dry for me. I heard the pressed sandwiches are good, but couldn't really justify paying for what look like toasties at a sit down restaurant (maybe if this were a food truck?)

I've had better Cuban food down in the States, but this is quite decent for a place this far north. I know that it's not authentic, but I quite like the atmosphere of this little place. Plus, this place opens quite late.
What a tremendously civilised little spot this is! Elegant and sweet, with lovely teal and fuchsia chairs, it's a charming place to get your tea fix.

And tea fix you will get. Their A4 menu has over two pages devoted to tea, tea, and more tea. I can't wait to come back another time when I can really take the opportunity to browse all of the teas on offer; Alisa R and I arrived shortly before closing time so we hurried on and ordered quickly.

I have only very recently discovered the chai latte so I ordered one of those, and we scuttled over to the counter to see what the cakes looked like. The cupcakes were on the little side, and being the greedy guts that I am, I was swayed by the huge blocks of millionaire's shortcake. Alisa went for the yummy-sounding chocolate and beet root cake, which wasn't pre-cut, but when the slice arrived it was super generous too!

I think the chai lattes I have had since discovering it have been the quick and easy versions made with powder or syrup, but that is not the Eteaket way. This one was, of course, made with Proper Tea, so it tasted thinner and less sweet, but more sophisticated.

My shortcake was very good; it was solid and held its form well, with rich chocolate and thick caramel. I did wish I had gone with Alisa's choice though because it was completely amazing when I tried a bit.

The staff were really sweet and friendly, and quick to serve, although we were the only people there so late in the day so I can't speak for busier times... Yet! But I'll be back!
Frederico Fellini was a brillant and enigmatic Italian director of films in the 50's, 60's and 70's. 4 of his films won an Oscar for best foreign film.
If you talk to any film afficianado, they would recognize his titles, like La Dolce Vita, 8 1\/2, La Strada, le notti de cabaria, and Amarcord . 

His movies were known for their psychological content, influenced by the famous Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, and their clever sexual innuendos (i.e. train entering a tunnel). He enjoyed the great Japanese Director, Akira Kurosawa, because they were both inspired by their own dream worlds, and Fellini influenced, by their own admissions, great international directors like Ingmar Bergman, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorcese and Bernado Bertolucci. 

He is considered by many one of the 10 best directors of all time. One of his characters in La Dolce Vita, named Paparazzo, who took pictures, inspired the term Paparazzi.

This Fellini's isn't a legend like Frederico was, but it is a solid Italian restaurant in the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino. The prices, for Vegas, are reasonable, and the food is tasty and well done if not extraordinary and memorable. 

The Carpaccio ($12.95) was nice, with capers, dry cheese, olive oil and arugula; the Angel Hair pasta with Rapini ($18.95) was very good and a lot of food; the Fettucine Capri was enough for 2 with a nice sauce that was in between a cream and a tomato base. Garden Salad was $6.95.  A nice Ruffino Reserve red wine ($37.00) added to the enjoyment of the food, and the Tira Misu ($6.95) was classic and light.

Service was good, although Steve, the best server, was off that day. 

Inside this Fellini's, you can get a good reliable Italian meal, unlike an unpredictable, wild and crazy, sexually charged Fellini Film. For something more like that, just step back out onto the Strip!
Delicious! We weren't starving so asked the waiter to select four appetizers that we could easy split. Such a great idea! See the pictures but we had tuna roll, octopus, lobster pasta, shrimp and oysters followed by these little pastries similar to a donut stuffed with either chocolate or vanilla cream. It was a wonderful experience and our waiter was top notch!! I would definitely go back and recommend anyone else to also.
Everyone must order at least one dish to chill here. Ok wifi, good for studying. Doesn't get too loud usually. They have different couches and decors that'll make you feel like a princess. The place itself is actually pretty big, they have some rooms in the back.

Drinks and food wise they're sub-par. Only their warm apple cider was good.
Our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along. I'm very pleased we went! Having never had Ethiopian food before, we were curious, but wary. The deal really helped us dive in. It included two appetizers, four main courses and two desserts. We started with two appetizers, one I wasn't a huge fan of (a "salad" with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos, which I found too strong, although other people in my group really liked it). The other appetizer was similar to an Indian samosa (similar name too, but I can't remember exactly what it was called). They were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell. They were DELICIOUS. BUT, their appetizers were only made for three people, so there were only three of them! Seems silly when you offer a four person deal. 
We each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter, so we could all share. We ordered two vegetarian options, one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef. Basically, the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera, which are sort of bland, cold, bread-like stuff, which comes rolled up. They're nothing special, but they're only used as a sort of utensil, because you use it to scoop up the food. The food was delicious! I especially liked the chickpea dish. Every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best! Worked out well. I personally found the beef dish very tough though. 
Once we were stuff with the food, we ordered two desserts. We especially liked the cheesecake (which is obviously not Ethiopian). 
We asked if they had any Ethiopian coffees and they said yes. THey showed us the beans, as they were being roasted. Then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups. The coffee was so rich, it was almost like chocolate. They also served it with a large basket of popcorn, which was just perfectly prepared. It was such a nice after dinner snack! I would totally come here just to order the coffee! 
It would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon, so I'm not sure I would make this a regularly destination, but as I said, the coffee was fantastic and it's a fun thing to try, especially with friends. Make sure they're good ones, that you don't mind getting messy in front of!
Delivery guy was great, pizza looked great but honestly the taste wasn't there, kind of cardboard tasting dough. Pizza was supposed to be pepperoni and sausage but ended up being two types of sausage, the delivery of the pizza and employees were good though. Don't think I'll order from here again so 3.5
Food was decent but the delivery guy was a total creep. When I called to order he was sounding very strange on the phone making moaning noises. When the food arrived I made my boyfriend go to the door to get the food and he was asking how the pretty girl was doing tonight etc. 

This was the first time we had ordered from there so I'd never met any of the employees - it was just plain weird. Certainly enough to never order from there again. 

GO TO or CALL TRIMURTI next door - the food is fabulous, best samosas I've ever had and they also deliver. Dal Makhani is also a winner.
Lululemon has luxurious, expensive workout wear and so when I'm shopping here I expect a higher level of customer service then, say, at Sports Authority.  I expect that the sales women know their product.  Anywho.

My first time in the store earlier this week was to browse and return a head band that I was assured was non slip.  As I tried it on my head on my way home, it slipped back.  Guess what?  They don't accept returns on accessories.  Not that that is clear on the receipt.  C'mon now, the tags were on and I had the receipt from a week prior.  No returns, no exchanges, despite my expression of unhappiness with the product.  

Then, I found a tank top I liked and wanted to pay cash but.....credit cards only.  ONLY.  Seriously?  I get it, most of us pay by credit card, but still, it's not like I was going to write a check.  I was told it's because it's a SHOWROOM not a store like the Biltmore location.  Oh, NOW that makes sense....(not).   

Two stores in the Phoenix area, two so-so experiences.  When I'm paying $125 or more for a workout outfit, I expect something a little more impressive.  I've learned my lesson, I'll stick to Lucy.
This is a great place to stay off-strip for non-gamblers.  The rooms are very nice.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  It is close to the team for easy access to the strip.
Las Rositas Mexican buffet is the best thing in Charlotte since the Panthers drafted Cam Newton. Traditional Mexican style dishes.Beef, pork and chicken Mexican dishes. Beef and pork soups. Salad and fruit bar. Buffet includes choice of corn and flour tortillas. In the weekends Las Rositas adds seafood to the buffet and Menudo. $6.99 during the week and $8.99 on the weekends. Closed on Mon. Que viva Mexico!
I've been here a half a dozen times. Always a great dining experience! You don't get better than this for a mid range dining experience.

Always friendly and prompt service. The place is always clean and we enjoy the ambiance.

We've been there as a couple and with a larger group...no problems.

I'm sure I'll be visiting again.
Contente d'avoir essayé ce petit resto dont tout le monde parle depuis quelque temps....Service un peu lent.. mais l'attente en vaut la peine! Partaagez les plats qui sont en plat principale ou en entrée plutôt que de choisir le spécial "à partager". Je vous conseille la soupe ramen, le tatziki au thon et surtout le crispy pork sur riz!!! Le tout d'accompagné d'une bière maison à 4$ :) KANPAII!
I love this place! I've been here a couple of times looking for toys and harnesses for my dogs. I ended up feeling so welcome that I actually came here to help cleaning the cats room and pet them and the dogs. I spent hours here watching the dogs and learning a little more about the store. They're all people with huge Hearts who are saving a lot of animals and help them rehabilitate and find good homes. If you ever have a chance check this place out, be prepared to spend some time in here as people are very friendly and you will be allowed to spend time with the animals if you ask. Please keep in mind everybody working there are volunteering so not necessarily they will be the most amazing in customer service but they do have a lot of love and care for the animals and will help you out to the best of their abilities.
Can never go wrong with their delicious cakes. Recently discovered their limited edition Greatest Hits which is so good! And not many people know that they have a cafe in the Cosmo Music store in Richmond Hill. Must go!
Found this little gem from a co-worker we were sending off. I have to say that this place is awesome for watching a game of any kind. TV's galore! This is a quaint little place right on Monona Drive and frankly there isn't really anything bad to say about it. The drinks are well priced, the food is pretty dang good, and the staff is friendly and attentive. 

Two small qualms, the door leading to their outdoor smoking\/patio area is obnoxious. We were trying to watch a basketball game and it seemed like every 5 minutes that dang door was slamming like a jet fighter flying by over the speed of sound. AND I was told the Boom Boom sauce was hotter than tobasco sauce NOT EVEN close haha but that is really nothing to scour at. Once again, a nice little place to enjoy a good meal, couple beers, and whatever game is on.
best burger in phx! fries are great! fry sauce is yummy! if you want a huge big juicy burger then just go and get the double!! it does not get much better then this, if you get it to go the bottom bum will be gone just about lol
Macy's is closing up shop.  I never go here, and agree with the negative reviews regarding everything from safety to store selection.

(This is actually the second time Macy's is closing a store here.  They had left the mall years earlier, but then reappeared when they bought Robinsons-May and converted it).
ya bro dis shit sux
Brady was both EARLY and I received a phone call informing me!, He got up into the eaves to check the unit, and explained useful life\/repair replace issues in a thoughtful manner.  Though they were fed my name through a home warranty company, I felt like my itty bitty condo was worth seven figures!
The last time I came here was 5 years ago and I found an ant in my sauce. No apology from anyone and still had to pay for my food. So I tried it again tonight and no joke there was hair in our food. Sent it back and they replaced it, but why would I want to eat the same thing that had hair in it? Again no apology, does this happen all the time there that it just rolls off their backs? 

So I have given it a second try and will never come back.
It was very disappointing to have a horrible waiter (tall, asian guy maybe in his 50s) and it effected my opinion of this place. We felt ignored the entire time we were dining. It took 15-20 to get water (after we FLAGGED down someone) and the restaurant wasn't even halfway full. It was like we were invisible! 

The food was okay. The petit filet mignon and the NY Strip was pretty bland, lacking flavor. They also didn't cook my bf's NY Strip as he requested (medium), and instead gave him a medium rare piece--red but not bloody. He's too polite to say anything so he ate it anyways. The oyster rockafeller, 2x baked potato & creamed spinach was delicious though. The "special garlic bread" was soooo lame though! 3 pieces for $5! It was basically texas toast! After reading reviews from others, I wanted to also mention that they also double charged us for the "special garlic bread" with 2 orders when we only ordered 1 and it was over-priced to begin with and dry.

To top off the night, the waiter had the audacity to ask me if we were using a GROUPON when giving us our check (keep in mind I had to ask for it because of the crappy service)! WTF!?! HAHA I'm not sure if that was a standard inquiry, but I thought it was an interesting question upon payment. I didn't find it appropriate, especially for a mediocre meal with embarrassing service. As Stephanie Tanner from Full House would say, "How Rude!".
An Iranian colleague told me that this place was the best and he was right. Love the kabobs and the freshly baked bread with hummus is to die for. Love this place. It's not fancy at all but the food is excellent.
This is a great little upscale diner. I feel that the prices are a little high, and that the service can be slow when it's busy. But the food is generally very good.

I've eaten the:

Steak and onion rings -- steak was a good size, and cooked just how I asked. Onion rings almost seemed like they were tempura battered, very crispy, light and sweet.

Calf's liver and onions -- I'm not a huge fan of liver normally, but I was feeling in an odd mood that night, so I went ahead and ordered it. The onions were caramelised with a touch of grain mustard for a nice zing. The liver was tender, just a little crispy from the pan, and I actually thought it was ok (which is saying a lot for me and liver). Red potatoes to go with were good.

Chicken curry -- I've never actually ordered it, but my neighbour and his wife swear by it. Apparently the chef is from Sri Lanka, which explains how a place like this can have good curry.
J'ai été deux fois pendant le Christmas Market!!! C'est beau, c'est magnifique!! Allez-y tôt et attendez-vous à faire beaucoup de line-up...mais ça vaut le coup!! Endroit magique!
I suppose I should write a review here since my little Noodle-oo is currently serving as their spokes dog in the photos. 

We both love Scooby Do's. They treat my little butt-faced dog like a prince and are receptive to correcting anything about the cut that I perceive as being weird. Like that funny poofy pompadour. Mohawk it out, yo. Done. In like five seconds my little man was looking fabulous and bad ass. Not something easily accomplished with a prancing pup that literally chases butterflies through tall grasses. (He ended up looking like a little lamb as the cut grew out too. So adorable.)

The shampoo they use here is also amazing. Noodles usually smells like tacos (a combination of beef stank and corn chips) but after getting back from the Do's, he smelled like Christmas morning! Sugar and spice and everything nice instead of frogs and snails and puppy dog tails. He's got some gender identity issues to deal with. 

The pricing is also cheaper than some of the big name conglomerates out there. I'm talking to you Petsmart! I've taken my other pup to Smelly Dog before, but unless I need dog sitting play time after the cut, I'll go with Scooby's. They genuinely seem to like my little Noodle monster.
Since I was in the area, I had to stop in for my Taiwanese food fix and I have to say even though the food is still good for what you can get in Phoenix, the format change to having wait service is terrible. 

First of all, I've never really liked the service even when it was order & pay at the counter, now they have it as a sit down restaurant. 

I changed my mind from having a large boba drink to a small and the girl behind the counter showed annoyance and asked if I will still purchase the large. Hmmmm, no- I want a small. 

Then the waitress kept bumping my table trying to serve the table next door. She apologized the first time. Then the 2nd, 3rd, FOURTH time it was bump, bump, bump. 

My bill was charged for the large drink- I asked for it to be changed to a small drink. That took a while. Then they didn't deduct the tax. I told my waitress and she lies to me straight in the face (this young 18 something) and tells me they don't charge tax on drinks because she didn't want to correct the bill. 

Totally unprofessional. 

Thumbs down.
Best burger I've had in a long time.  Cozy little spot behind Pita Kabob in downtown Matthews. Everything we had was delicious and the service was great!
where to start...
a few months ago I slammed.my truck into a curb. I destroyed the wheel and rim. took the truck to Discount tire to get replacements, which they were able to do. They got a factory rim and a new tire the following day. It could have been same day but the I had miss there delivery from the dealership. 

I took it to get it aligned across the street and they said they did the best they could. They're best was well really bad the stirring wheel if you hold it straight the truck would go straight but if you left go the house whole truck went to the left. 

Discount Tire told me they recommend going to Quality Star down rancho. we brought it to them. Later that day they said it would be bout 500 for a control arm thats cracked. But it's still pulling so they need to work on it. Later that same day they called and said it would be another hundred and something for another part. they were really sorry but they are trying to fix it but they keep find problems.  We went down to pay and see it is was down. when we got there they were test driving it. but told me the bill was now eight hundred and something. I was annoyed but just wanted my truck fixed. however when they were done with the test drive he said it's better but not perfect and ask for more time. we let them keep it a few more days but  when we would call for updates it was just a run around. 
I had a gut feeling something was wrong so we went down and said we just want the truck back. they gave us a speech about how it's a process and we should turn it into insurance because the whole front end on the passenger side needs to be replaced. I said hell no and took my truck home on the way I noticed if you hold the wheel level it now went to the left and it you let go it quick pulled to the right. so I had to fight to keep it straight. I also notice when I got home they banged my drive side door frame so I am missing paint along the door

we called a relative worried bout the truck and not sure where to go or what to do. 
He told me to take it to Arrow Alignment and they would take a look. He sends all his customers there that have issues  with there alignments. 
We made an appointment and took it in this morning. They are pretty far from me. the Mechanic talked to us for a few minutes and asked for some background about the problem. 
he said the give him about an hour. 
I went back to work fearing another big bill. but thankfully that didn't happen. I went down and he said he fixed it. that it was the alignment and also the wheel as it had worn wrong because of how I had been having to drive it. Then the most unexpected thing happened. he didn't charge me a dime and said I had already paid enough and he was sorry it was so much trouble to get fix.
When i travel to Caltexico, I go by way of Moe's.  Because although Chipotle and Qdoba do a fine fast food burrito, they don't do it as well as Moe's.  

And it is fast food, but it pains me to categorize it in that fashion, because when I say fast food, you're thinking Taco Bell. . . and it's not THAT.  It's a step up.  The comparison is perhaps equivalent to a Red Robin to Wendy's sort of thing.  Red Robin is to Wendy's what Moe's is to Taco Bell.  

It's fast (though if you go at noon for a lunch hour meal, you'll question ANY categorization of their food involving the adjective "fast"), but good.

I go with the Joey Bag o' Donuts burrito combo with steak and black beans.  Yum.  I'm full now.
We've been wanting to try this restaurant for sometime now and I thought Valentines Day would be the perfect day to give it a try.

Unfortunately I didn't think of reserving it until about 4 days before Valentines. The only time they had left was 9:45 PM. I reserved it anyway.

I was a little concerned they'd be rushing us to finish our meal, so we arrived about 40 minutes early. I figured we could have a couple of drinks at the bar if they weren't able to seat us. Fortunately they were able to seat us right away.

Our waitress, Mettia, was awesome! Attentive and professional and friendly.

The ambiance was great.

The food was mediocre and we waited over an hour from when we placed our order for the food to arrive.

The staff and ambiance are reason enough for a return visit. I just hope they can improve the quality of their food and the speed of delivery.

Overall we really enjoyed ourselves and would recommend it to others.
Shared the "cinnamon bun" crepe.  It was a proper crepe thickness, but I felt it was overfilled.  They definitely added a massive amount of frosting to it!  Thankfully the accompanying whipped cream wasn't overly sweet.

It was great at first bite, but less so as it was consumed.  The sugar really catches up to you!  I regretted not getting a water.

Probably somewhat overpriced, but service was fast, and they didn't put too much ice in my dining companion's Pepsi.
I actually liked this one more than Love, and it had less sleepy downtime than O (though O's soundtrack is superb).  It wasn't as action-packed as Ka, and the storyline was even less prominent than Mystere.

Basically it's just a serious of circus acrobatic acts.  If that's something you'd enjoy, then you'd like this production.  Don't expect a flowing storyline though.
We ate here on a recent visit to Vegas. We found it to be a decent meal for the price. We'd eat here again.

There was lot's of variety to choose from.
Came for the Pho, left with enough food for 3 days.. Food coma, so I'm having a difficult time organizing my thoughts.. just AMAZING! This-is-where-I'm-going-for-last-supper amazing. Light, fresh, veggies were crispy, tofu was perfectly fried crunchy and then warm and soft inside.. also had beef pho, above and beyond satisfying, and most notably light on the saltiness which was really refreshing!! Try the Vietnamese crepe with shrimp and pork too!! Ownership was really super friendly and helpful- overall this clean, modern spot had earned a spot in my dinner rotation.
Simply one of the best restaurants in the charlotte area.....I have been going back there since they opened in 1992....have tried a lot of stuff on the menu and it is always superb... The buttermilk fried chicken breast with stone ground grits and collards is my favorite brunch item. Love the Mediterranean shrimp and scallops as well. They also have very good pizza. You will not regret eating at Trio!
i have to say i've only heard good things about this place and finally got the opportunity to try it out!
this place is so charming and old school chic i would for sure put it on my things to do in montreal in 48hours list!
the menu was a little small but everything sounded delicious. the service was great...lots of eye candy serving and being served!
i dont know what the summer menu looks like but what was on for January winters in Mtl was perfect!
The tram service is very fast!  The longest wait was around 6 minutes during slow times when only one tram runs.  Even at peak times (nighttime after the shows, New Years Eve, etc) the cars weren't overly crowded.

With well over a dozen trips, I've only seen a piece of trash once (an empty popcorn tub behind a seat).

The little video that plays does get annoying when it constantly loops the same thing constantly ("Zarkana!  Mandarin Oriental!  Zarkana!").

Watch for the lighted sign with the arrow that points to which tram is arriving next!
Two Scoops is a great addition to Plaza Midwood. I was surprised to see how many flavors they had. Tons of classics and just as many fun flavors. They are happy to explain any of the flavors and let you sample. I ended up with two scoops - chocolate thin mint & pralines and cream. I can't wait to get back and try more flavors! 

They don't make their own waffle cones but the guy helping us said they were delish. Hope they start making their own soon!

Service was friendly, prices were fair, and no problems with finding parking or seating.
This place is really close to my boyfriend's house so we decided to stop here one night to satisfy our sweet tooth cravings. We were the only customers inside at the time but was impressed with how many choices they have as well as their beverage selection. We had a few samples, all fantastic! I honestly can't remember what I ordered but remember it being delicious! They have a lot of sorbets and fruit flavors too if that's more your style. Girls behind the counter were helpful and gave suggestions for flavor combinations. Oh and the place smells wonderful!! The waffle cone pieces they give you in your gelato are good too!

Will come back!!
Top-of-it's-game coffee at this Grouchy Johns spot!My geeky side shined once I walked into Grouchy John's!  Murals with Boba Fett, Pooh Bear!  Then I looked at the drink menu and the names!  
This is a wonderful coffee shop;)
The staff is admirably geeky about their crafted drinks, friendly & efficient service.  The staff alone will have you returning.  Please ask them for suggestions and customization options;)
Now what does that mean, many things. For starters you are never waiting long for your crafted drink choice.  Here they also have a drive thru and free Wi-Fi. Make sure you have a seat under the mural with Boba Fett.  I'm curious though, Boba Fett does not have a drink on the menu...why not?!
Curious George does:)
I went in for caffeine only. 
I ordered two drinks.
Indeed I ordered a smoothie (I'm not a smoothie drinker).  His name was Yoda. Yes! Clearly, this is why Yoda left with me. Yoda is part of their Trilogy, next time Lando is coming home.
Smoothies, hot drinks, blended drinks, speciality ones- they have it.  Customize however your tastebuds wish:)   Pastries and other delicious items are excellent, too.  muffins, donuts, sandwiches, wraps all fresh and tasty!  I left with a selection, truth be told!  Trust me, you will as well.
Being the adults that we are, we went for a friend's surprise (25th) birthday party. We were instructed to meet at 7pm on a Tuesday night. Finding the facility was easy and there was ample parking. We created an electronic account and filled out a paper waiver. Jump times are sold in one hour increments ($10.50 during the week, higher on the weekend) and start every 1\/2 hour. We warmed up on the main trampoline. Half of it was off limits because they had an AIRobics class going. We still had a plenty of room to jump but I could see it becoming sketchy if it was busier. After a few minutes, we were all sweating. Man, what a workout! We all took a few turns at jumping into the foam pit. Fun, but gross... I don't even want to think about all the nasty stuff on those foam blocks that I threw my face in to. Dodgeball was definitely the highlight of the visit. There were 14 in our group and we were definitely the majority. I could see the lines getting really backed up on busier days. 

The facility itself is huge. In addition to the "main" area they have arcade games, private courts, a kids jump area, a birthday party area, and a food court. There was even an area with large flat screens and comfy seating where you could watch video feeds of the jumping areas along with the news. 

Overall, I would definitely return but I would probably avoid this place on weekends.
I always love watching the fountain show at Bellagio. Very romantic, can be cheesy, but good. 

The only reasons they miss a star is because I think the songs and choreography need updating, but keep the classics. And I thought the fountains in Barcelona, which are along a government center and move to music up and down a street, with a large centerpiece fountain are more beautiful because you can get really close to the jets, get a little wet, and it was designed in 1929 and is still awe-striking.
What's with Hickory Taverns always being so dark inside, regardless of how bright it is outside? Maybe it's an attempt to contribute to a "Tavern feel" but at this small Hickory Tavern off Charlotte Hwy in Indian Land, it's almost depressing. 

The food here is good, and the service has been solid on multiple visits so far. Nothing to blow your socks off, however. I don't have any particular "go to" menu items at Hickory Tavern because nothing stands out as "so delicious I want to come back for that". I like to order the steak sandwich and then decompose it and eat it as a steak with bread and fries. I also have tried their lobster roll a few times. It's a passable lobster salad, and will do in a fix, but there are (thankfully) better ones in Charlotte these days!

This is one of the few restaurants where I can feel comfortable ordering unsweet tea, knowing that it won't be bitter. They do a good job with their tea brewing. Hey, maybe THAT'S my "go to", their unsweet iced tea!

Better for lunch than dinner, given how packed it can get in the evenings. If you're in the area and looking for a sports bar, Hickory Tavern's probably the best option for a few miles.
Came here on a Sunday afternoon for late lunch.  Not busy at all.  Food and service was excellent!  We ordered the bruschetta for our appetizer, one of the best in my book!  For main course, we split the Italian beef sandwich with au jus and a small 7" pizza with pepperoni with banana peppers and onions.  The sandwich do die for!  We added provolone cheese but in all honesty I could've eaten it plain.  The beef was perfectly cooked and sliced super thin the way it should be!  The pizza was cooked perfectly as well, it tasted like homemade pizza with the freshest ingredients.  I can't say anything bad about this place except there's not a location close to my house.  Even the napkins were great!
Olive Garden kind of speaks for itself. It's a chain that offers inauthentic "Italian" cuisine. And while this sounds harsh, these restaurants are usually nothing to write home about. Having said that, I will happily admit that all self control goes out the window when a basket of breadsticks and salad is set in front of me. Really, I cannot help myself! The pasta here is mediocre at best but something about the start of your meal makes it all worth while. Typically the service here is good and nothing tops of a faux Italian meal like one of their peach iced teas. It is always worthwhile to have dinner here when they are having their never-ending pasta bowl special. Go big or go home, am I right? :)
This location is located in the Red Rock Casino. You can enter and exit either through the casino or from the parking lot. I like the fact that you don't have to walk through the casino to get inside.

Great food as always. Doesn't matter which location you go to, it is always consistently good food. They have a great menu if you enjoy Barbecue.

The Beef Ribs are excellent. The best I can remember eating anywhere. They are meaty and tender and the sauce is amazing.

The BBQ Chicken and the brisket are also excellent. I could go over each item, but I can promise you there is nothing on the menu that will disappoint you. Catfish, burgers, salads, side dishes...etc, all are awesome!!
Had the brisket ramen and what I wanted up with was more veins and fat then anything that resembled beef brisket.  Broth was OK and the noodles were indeed good but not sure if I would go back
Best Cirque Du Soleil show in Las Vegas!

If you are deciding on a show to see in Las Vegas you cannot go wrong with O. Put simply, go see it! It's close to impossible to be disappointed with this masterpiece.

O on paper and by word of mouth  throughout the local Las Vegas community is rated one of the best shows to ever hit the strip and 2 minutes into it you will see why.. Acrobatics, synchronize swimming, pyrotechnics, diving  and comedy are parts of the show that will leave you amazed. 

Without throwing spoilers into this review I will say you will see a character in a bathtub rowing across a pool and blowing fire. Now if that doesn't get wanting to see more I don't know what else will.

The best new seats in the house are the new VIP balcony booths. I highly recommend getting this as you will have your own wait staff, drinks and something to nibble throughout the show. The views are  also incredible.

The show is just under 2hrs long so make sure you have either eaten or gone to the bathroom before as it's a thrill a second. I can't say enough without spoiling it. Highly recommended.

Overall
Drinks: 5-5
Service: 5-5
Entertainment value: 5-5
See it again: Yes in a heart beat
WHAT?! I thought... I thought this place was tiny! I... I have to dress up as Thorin now and hug Robyn Z while saying emotionally: "Never have I been so wrong." Memetastic.

Basically, behind the cute'n'kooky cafe out front displaying its deeeelicious looking cakes, there is this enormous and beautiful room with elaborate wallpaper, an upright piano, cool art on the walls, candles, lots and lots of tables and space... woah. I had no idea.

When we arrived, we were offered a couple of options for places to sit, and we (predictably, on such a freezing cold night) elected to sit next to the radiator. The only slight issue with this was that I had my back to the upright piano, which has a little lip on the lid. I have this big, big laugh that is basically a "HAAA!" with my head thrown back, and on one occasion this resulted in my almost needing stitches, but I think I managed to stop the bleeding... ok, exaggeration. I bumped my head on the corner and said "ow" quietly, is all that happened.

Anyway, the food, folks. I wasn't too sold on the bread that came while we awaited our mains - the wholemeal seemed a little bitter and dry. However, when the main event arrived... well, I can't remember the last time the very first mouthful of something made my eyes widen, my heart leap and my voice go "OH!". I'd ordered the guinea fowl with curly kale and sauteed new potatoes, and that kale and those potatoes were the first thing I tried. And OH MY. Flavour explosion. Amazing! The guinea fowl was tender and perfectly cooked. At first, when the plate arrived, I thought there wasn't much on it, but it was the perfect amount. I had a couple of Robyn's fries that came with her steak, too, and oh my. Light, crispy, beautifully seasoned... perfection.

Dessert was where the real difficulty lay because the selection was fairly astounding. We informed the waiter of our indecision and he was so helpful with his recommendations. "The sticky toffee pudding is the most popular, but in my opinion, is nothing special. The carrot cake is very good, and the fruit and frangipane tart." Right you are, sir! Carrot cake for Robyn Z, F&F tart for me, and, of course, we partook of one another's desserts... in the name of, er, reviewing completionism. My tart was warm, which I hadn't expected, and served with mascarpone. It was utterly delicious, although "fruit" seemed a little vague and I'm not convinced there was much involved beyond apple. I could be wrong, but that's how it seemed. Robyn's carrot cake was monumentally huge and really nice, although I'm not sure it necessarily would stand for me in an identity lineup of carrot cakes. Oh, but to be in a situation where I had to taste an identity lineup of cakes... now I'm in a dream world...
Chic consistency is how I would sum up this classic example of what American dining should be.

Another visit Sunday night 7:30 work friend gathering party of 5. The first arrival was seated in a large booth on the north side of this gorgeous spot.  Of course the best views are at the bar but a booth is more spacious & conducive to conversation.  

Our server was Yanni which she was kind, down to earth, and accurate with our requests. She made our experience seem cozy and comfortable.  When I read reviews of pretense at Hillstone, I cannot relate.  Yes the architecture and cuisine is nearly flawless, it does not seem snooty at all.

Our table had the ahi tuna steak, gulf coast fish sandwich, veggie burger, Thai steak salad, tuna mango roll, and bread.  All of us enjoyed the fresh straightforward preparations and delicious flavor combinations.  Yanni suggested the mi sueno el llano Cabernet to accompany my Thai steak salad- great choice.  A smooth lingering berry wine really enhanced the mango & filet mignon.  

We shared a couple key lime pies with the non sweet whipped cream.  Truly a delicious example of classic pastry.  The lime filling with cold and tart not overly sweet and the perfect minty green homemade color.  The crust is a nutty crumble that you press your fork into the last crumbs.

I will continue to recommend this establishment to visiting clients in my nearby biltmore fashion park boutique.

Thank you to Hillstone for their service, food, and chic consistency.
I had no idea there was a Starbucks near the South Garage in the Red Rock Casino. I have always parked at the opposite end garage or outside.

This spot is perfect. There is less traffic on this side of the casino, so you don't have to wait in line too long.
-Pho Burger (cooked beansprouts, basil, lime, sriracha & hoisin sauce, side pho jus sauce) - $7.50: 
The portion was actually pretty small for $7 and it was just enough for me without filling us up. The burger was served with a side of pho jus sauce and you were supposed to either dip the bun into the broth or just take a few sips while eating. I recommend the latter as the burger was already quite messy to eat with the sriracha and hoisin sauce dripping down. The pho burger had all the toppings of a pho noodle soup (without the noodles of course) - bean sprouts, basil, sriracha and hoisin sauce was not necessary since I'm Northern Viet but it's alright to have it :). The patties were freshly grounded in store daily and they were cooked to medium well and served on a fresh ace bakery bun.

 I can tell you from the get go this broth is AUTHENTIC. It was clear, not too fatty and very flavorful. The burger arrived piping how and it was just incredible! Juicy and delicious, sip some of the broth and it tasted just like eating a bowl of pho. With that said, I would have liked it more if the patty was slightly bigger and if the beansprouts were semi-cooked to preserve some crunch, that would have been nice as I felt the beansprouts were quite soggy.
I came to Catch around 6:45 on a Thursday evening for dinner. I was really excited to try Catch because I love seafood and it came highly recommended by a friend.

The restaurant wasn't too busy when we arrived, but it filled up pretty quickly. It is a small establishment, so if you are keen to go then you may want a reservation. As other reviewers have mentioned, the restaurant becomes extremely noisy and it is very difficult to hear your companions speak. I am a young person and had to ask my friends to repeat themselves on numerous occasions. The decor is pretty basic although they do have interesting serving plates. I also liked how there is a very open kitchen (look to your left when you enter) so you can see everything the chefs are doing.

Service was satisfactory. There was a bus boy and it seemed like his only job was to clear plates and fill water glasses. Our glasses were never empty, but he always seemed to be at our table. This could be fixed if they used bigger water glasses!

There were a few things that irritated me about our service that made me feel like the waitress was trying to increase the size of our bill:

1) My friend and I wanted to share a glass of white wine and she clearly explained this to the waitress and asked her to bring a second empty glass. When our waitress came back, she returned with two rather full looking glasses of wine. When we asked if that was one glass that had been split in half, she said she had thought we ordered two glasses of wine.

2) When asked about dish recommendations, she always suggested the more expensive of two options. This happened twice to me, so it seemed a bit suspicious.

3) As other reviewers had mentioned, the waitress recommended a pound of fish per person if you go for "the big catch". But, there were no fish that were 1 pound, the smallest was 1.5 pounds. You also hVe to be careful because the prices of the fish are not indicated on the specials chalkboard and you have to ask for them. Prices ranged from about $50 to over $80.

The reason why this restaurant gets three stars rather than two is because of the food. Three of us ordered:

1) Gazpacho ($10) - this was the worst dish of the meal. It was a gazpacho soup with seafood garnish. (1 shrimp, 2 very small scallops, a hunk of white fish, and a few rings of calamari). The calamari was extremely chewy and I personally found it to be inedible. The flavour of the gazpacho base was decent and had a bit if a kick, but I found it to be rather salty and disgustingly oily such that I couldn't finish it. I would never order this dish again... and it came recommended from our waitress. 

2) Tuna Cesar salad ($11) - this was a decent portion and my friend liked it.

3) Clams linguine ($19) - another good sized portion and my friend finished it off, so I think he enjoyed it! It was a bit odd that they did not give him a spoon for the linguine or a side plate for his empty shells and he had to ask for both.

4) Sea diver scallops with a sweet pea purée and a bacon garnish ($29) - my friend loved this dish and said she would definitely order it again. I tried a bite of one of her scallops and would have to agree that they were quite well cooked.

5) Roasted halibut with a zucchini leek side ($30) - this came with two good sized fillets of halibut. The fish was cooked perfectly. The zucchini leek side consisted primarily of olives and capers, and I did not find much zucchini or leek. Might would order this again if I came back to the restaurant.

6) Sautéed kale and spinach with roasted garlic ($5) - my friend ordered this as a side to her scallops. I had a bite and I thought that the greens were fine, but rather flavourless. I wouldn't order this dish again, but would try a different side instead. 

The scallops and the halibut were what elevated the restaurant from two stars to three. There are many other interesting restaurants in the area, and new ones are constantly opening. I wouldn't go back to Catch just for the halibut and the scallops. Overall I was disappointed with my experience.
Danny and his crew are absolutely WONDERFUL! We appreciate their honesty and hard work. We will continue to bring our vehicles to them.
What a BEAUTIFUL restaurant! High Class Place.  Sushi was Fresh and very Delicious. i tried the Tuna pizza Appitizer and WOW the Flavors were incredible! Great view for the water show also highly recommend
Update September 2016: They changed their noodle soup recipe.  It's now a bowl containing a super bland oil slick.  I've never had my hands get super greasy from a bowl of noodle soup before!  Ate the noodles and wonton and then tossed it.  Very sad.

---

Popped in here Sunday night.  It was pretty empty, so hopefully they'll get busier as people figure out they are open.  The windows facing Bashas' have blackout screening on them so the restaurant looks closed from the Ray road side.

The older Asian cashier was pleasant.  They were out of noodles, so I couldn't try the wonton "noodle soup."  He also said the noodles were similar to "lo mein noodles" when I asked if they were ramen or saimin noodles.

We ordered loco moco, BBQ beef (more teriyaki than shoyu style), and kalbi (Korean BBQ) ribs.  The burger and BBQ beef were seasoned and cooked well, and my mom seemed to enjoy her kalbi.  The rice was properly cooked, though I wasn't a fan of the mac salad or soggy large leafy greens under the entrees.  I wish they had put the loco moco over rice instead of the greens.  One of the eggs in my loco moco was overcooked.

I have two spam musubi in my fridge right now that I am hoping make for a good lunch tomorrow!

The misalignment of the ocean paining in the dining room annoys me (there are visible gaps between the three sections), but their flatscreen tv is VERY nice.  All of the furniture is brand new too, and the place was very clean!

The three entrees plus the musubi came to around $35 after tax, without any drinks.

I'll drop by again to see how their soup measures up to the real deal at Aloha Kitchen.
terrible Walmart. Always out of stock. Long lines. Cashiers are busy talking amongst themselves. Just awful customer service
I went there a few weeks after they opened. The food dim sum was decent, but the service was poor. We didn't get our food until 45 mins later. They charged us $7.00 for a bottle of miller lite, I think that's extreme for domestic 12 oz beer. Seems like the waiters and waitresses were confused and were not sure what we order, we ended up not getting two of our dim sum orders. We were told the kitchen recycled our paper where we placed our order...lol. After our first time with poor service, we wanted to give them another chance. We went back a week later and this time the service was even worse. We sat at our table for a good 25 minutes, no one came and asked us if we wanted water or even gave us the menu. We decided to leave the place. Until I hear the service has improved, I will not waste my time and money at this place.
We dined at GB's last evening, for the first time and had an enjoyable experience. Wouldn't say a 4 or 5 star experience, as many reviewers have noted but to each their own. The service certainly deserves high marks, as it was truly 1st class. From start to finish, our server knew the perfect time to visit the table, knew the menu inside and out and kept the water and wine glasses full.

The wine list was also quite impressive, with predictably inflated prices but many quality choices. The food, from appetizer to entree's, were good but certainly not special. For instance, the She Crab Soup had an abundance of crab flavor but there was a minimum amount of crab. Our server warned me, in advance, that " the lumps in your soup will be the larger pieces of the crustaceans". Not in my bowl. Ordered the pork chop entree, a generous portion of juicy and tasty chop but covered in overly sweet BBQ sauce......certainly not special. My Bride's filet was a bit over cooked but remained juicy despite being ordered medium. Our request for Au Poivre sauce for her filet was graciously accommodated.

In typical French fashion, the tables are dreadfully close together except for the booths on the perimeter of the dining room. The glasses on our table were rattled more than once by the servers of other guests. If you looking for a fine meal, including some conversation, reserve a booth or prepare to adjust the volume up. We'll return again but only if we can reserve a booth and then maybe we'll have a similar experience as those 4\/5's!
Pane Bianco came up as "highly recommended" for lunch on my Yelp app and is close to work so I decided to stop in for lunch and to try somewhere new. Parking was a bit tight and not a lot of spaces in general but was luckily able to snatch one. There are two sides to enter, one for to-go and one for eat in. I walked inside and the décor was so cute, very vintage meets farmhouse feel. They wanted to stick me at a long table with another party of 2 but felt awkward so I went to sit up at the bar, since there weren't any small tables to choose from. Service was very fast, ordered a diet coke but received a coca cola "light", which in my opinion does not taste like diet coke. Oh well. 

I read their menu (which is VERY limited) and looked on their board for the specials of the day. There were a total of 4 sandwiches, 4 salads and 2-3 "bar size" options to choose from and that's all. Only 2 of the options had meat in them so I was a bit disappointed with that and neither option was what I wanted. I ultimately ordered the market sandwich, which was a roasted tomato, arugula and goat cheese on focaccia bread. I think the servers were bored because it wasn't busy and they kept circling around waiting for something to do, very weird. Maybe I noticed it more because I was alone? Anyways, I got my food within 5 minutes and it came with a tiny serving of coleslaw, which was made with apples and red onions. The sandwich was fine but nothing amazing...coleslaw was different but ate it in like 3 bites. I was still hungry after my lunch so decided to order the flourless chocolate cake for dessert...couldn't pass that up! It was really great, came with a vanilla bean cream on top to balance out the richness of the cake. I got the bill and it was $22 so not cheap...the market sandwich with no meat on it was $12! Yikes. 

All in all, I just came to realize that Pane Bianco is just not for me. I know they have great ingredients and does have a certain appeal, very downtown. I did notice the dinner options and was curious if dinner time is a better time to go, since options were things I actually wanted to eat (stuffed peppers, posole, pasta, pizza). So, I wouldn't not recommend it I just don't think I would come back. Glad I tried it though!
I had a lovely experience at SAGE a few days ago with a party of 5. Casual chic with a nice atmosphere. You can converse which is lovely--as some Vegas restaurants are loud and obnoxious. The portions are generous for the price, and the ingredients were incredibly fresh. I opted to do the 4 course tasting menu, which was plentyyyy of food and only $80 (you can wine pair for an additional $40). I had the wagyu beef tartar (perfect consistency and temp but a tad bit bland to be honest), maine scallops w\/ braised oxtail and broccolini (yummmX1000), 48 hour beef belly (I'm not a hugeeeee beef belly fan but whatever, it was tasty), and some chocolate amazing desert with mocha icecream. My friends had the fluke, skirtsteak & the octopus as an app which could have easily been a smaller main! The service was attentive without being annoying, and they were knowledgeable about the food\/wine\/spirits.

PS--I don't recommend the ginger cocktail though (forget the name, but was served in a quaint copper cup) and they gave us a complimentary after-dinner "chocolate soup" shot which was horrible and tasted heavily like chai (Chef McClain, if you're reading this please stop! lol) Cheers!
Little bit of drink science happens here.

While waiting for friends to hit up downtown with us and being still a little early we strolled into Vanguard. 

Passing here quite a few nights it's always packed so we took advantage of the early birds we are and jumped in to down a drink or two.

Serving up some infused tequila and a Moscow mule we sat and chatted with the bartender for a bit and got a little more info on the place. 8am he said was the calm before the storm, when this place gets more than 4 people in it, some sort of magnet draws people in by the truckload. So if your planning a night with a group or just a couple make sure to come in a little early.

This place is all cocktails, they do have beer but not on tap. Good atmosphere and resonable drink prices I'd say this place has a lot going for it!!! Hell just look at all the other great reviews.....
This is my goto sushi spot! I come probably 3 times a month and if i could, id come more :) i love the variety and the consistancy here. I loveeee the daily specials that are available everyday too! If you like great quality sushi for the ayce price, Bomb is the way to go!!!
A hidden treasure in Pineville, NC with quality food, generous 'Rita's & reasonable prices! I had the Burrito Veracruz and it was wonderful. Plenty of pork carnitas, beans and three different sauces; green, white & red! Think about it... Fajitas were had by my mate and she say good flavor, take home portion & a let's do it again! Stop by and give it a try!
Mexicans in town like to complain that Los Tacos is not authentic, they don't make their own tortillas etc, and maybe they're right...but the food is really good nonetheless. I have not found a better carnitas taco. I get it with everything and it's great. In fact everything I've sampled has been excellent. Somebody else posted that they didn't like beans on their taco...then don't order it with beans! Duh!! Opinions vary widely when it comes to tacos but you should definitely give this place a try and make up your own mind.
This was a pleasant surprise. The Stratosphere is too far down the strip and consequently is a pain to get to. We decided to finally check it out and saw the ad for this place. It is free to go up to the lounge. It is a bit of a pain to get up, but worth it if you are in the area.

Once to level 107 you get panoramic views of the city. This is one of the best views of the city. I still prefer Mix or Foundation, but this is also very good. They have very good happy hour deals and a good drink menu. Our server was great. She was attentive and very helpful. There is a lot of seating options and a bar if you prefer to sit there.
Super friendly and quick. The prices are very fair as well. I've used them on several occasions and I'm always pleased (:
This has been my quick stop store for a number of years as it's right across the street from where I live.

It's always been quick and friendly.

A great corner store.
I came here to hear a friend sing, but I did order their flatbread pizza.  I'm a vegetarian, and when I asked for it without meat, they were perfectly accommodating (it sounded like my request wasn't a common one) - and it was very yummy.  But their mojitos - off the charts.  SO good!  Very nice vibe to this place, I plan on coming back.
I ate there last night for the first time so I had to order the "Logan" steak.  It wasn't great but it wasn't bad either.  The steak was juicy and well-seasoned.  The fries were a little stale and the steamed broccoli was...well...just steamed broccoli.  The best thing though was the warm rolls dripping with melted butter.
Dancing Queen!

Great show that would make you want to get on your feet and dance with ABbA's catchy tunes from the late 70's.  Although I have not seen their performance in Las Vegas (are they still in Las Vegas?) I have seen this musical 3x elsewhere. Once at the Orpheum in San Francisco in 2001 and twice at the California Musical Theatre in 2005 and 2012! Great show and funny story.

The show is nothing about the band at all. I am familiar with the songs from ABba and I thought it was clever to produce a musical based on the songs and tell an original story. It is a feel-good musical featuring more than 20 classic ABBA hits you may or may not be familiar with, including "Dancing Queen", "S.O.S." "Mamma Mia", "Take a Chance on Me", Chiquitita", "The Name of the Game", "Winner Take It All", "Money, Money, Money" and "Does Your Mother Know".  The cast was great... I will always be biased and favor the cast ensemble from the first time I watched it. The costumes were great and the show takes you to flashback 70's.  Fantastic and fun finale!

Review #0338
Easily one of my favorite restaurants -- anywhere.  The food is always so good and fun.  We always get mussels and the baked goat cheese app.  I can't think of anything I've ever ordered that I haven't thought was quite good.  And everyone I've ever taken has loved the place.  The place has a good mix of menu items to keep everyone happy.  (We even went  here after my law schol graduation!)  Just thinking about it makes me hungry.   

The prices are a solid good deal.  Beer list is good, they make good brunch cocktails, and the wine list is solid.  The place is small and cozy and the service is friendly (though sometimes a bit slower than you might like).  If you go for brunch, be aware that a line will form outside before the place even opens -- yeah, it's that good!
Really a unique neighborhood cafe. Beach decor with lively music. The happy hour specials are worth the trip. Just a fun place with nice friendly wait staff.
New to Charlotte.  I think that makes a difference in how you feel about this event.  I thought it was OK.  There were corporate sponsors mixed in with local restaurants, and the coins to purchase food with were a bit pricey, and there was a huge crowd, and it was hot, but this is comparable with most events of this type.  I liked that I was able to sample a bunch of restaurants with relatively little investment and research and talk to lots of people since I just relocated here.  I don't know if I'd go again next year, but it was definitely a good choice at the time.  Some of the lines for meat-based dishes were expectedly long (like bacon-wrapped steak) , but overall,  I didn't have to wait too long for anything I wanted.  I did like seeing local performers doing belly dancing, capoeira, and aerial dance.  This gave me a better sense of the kinds of activities that are available here. Your mileage may vary, but if you want a general sense of what's in Charlotte,  I think it's worth a few hours.
I think I actually want to give China Palace four stars, but I am not sure yet... 

I avoided this place for awhile because of its generic sounding name. Once I saw the extensive menu, with vast vegetarian selections, I realized that there is hope for a vegetarian in need of a quick fix. And I have found the food to be well above average American-Chinese takeout . 

I really like the chewy consistency of their soy protein. I am a fan of chewy...I know it's not for everybody. 

They do have brown rice! At least, they do now, and it's mighty good. A little chewy, too. 

Last night, I tried the "Sizzling Sensation" wheat gluten (mock beef). The sauce was not as spicy or peppery as I would have liked, but it was flavorful and the texture of the gluten was pleasantly soft and chewy (not as hard as the soy protein, though my dining companion who is not a fan of the chewy likened it to gristle). I also had the broccoli with garlic sauce, which is the dish I usually count on in Chinese fare, and it was a delicious compliment to the other dish. Unlike the broccoli and garlic sauce of most places, the broccoli was not swimming in goop and it actually tasted garlicky and even tangy. The broccoli was crisp and fresh. The meal was entirely satisfying and I will order both of these dishes again. 

Speaking of dishes, one entree that I can warn against is the "Taro Bowl A-La-King." Looks and tastes as if cooked in dish water... 

If you do not like greasy food, order from the selection of steamed dishes, or "weight watchers" items. That goes for just about anywhere! 

Delivery from China Palace has been quick in my experience, almost unbelievably so! In-house service is also quick and notably friendly.
Indifferent oversalted chicken Rosemary pie, terrible soggy overdressed salad. 

Nice staff though.
Great pizza and wings for the prize. Great flavor! Wings were very good. Timely in the order.
coffees good, plenty of cream and sugar on the table so you wont have to ask for more.
the full menus available all day minus soups but only because they might not be ready. 

Nice clean place from floor to ceiling. Feels.really big and open. The log cabin feel is great reminds me of little diners up the California coast. 

The food portions are great and the price is good. 10.99 seems to be the average breakfast price. It taste good and flavorful. doesn't have that frozen reheated taste you get else where.
Holy Value! Sushi is very well done and LARGE. A lunch with appetizer and bottled water cost around 10 bones. Very clean and comfortable. Elegant and simple in the Japanese tradition.
What a treat to be a member of Hand and Stone massage.  The staff and masseuse are always friendly and the quality of the massage is the BEST!  I have had the opportunity to have experienced quite of few of their massage therapists and I can say the degree of quality over other spas is very obvious, even the resorts that we have access too, and a much better price!! Thanks
Beers on the patio 

Working out a place to have a beer with a few friends after work we stopped by for a few cold ones at Gordon's.

The menu has a nice extensive beer range with beers on draft and bottle. They also have some great beers that are company brewed. The brown ale they have has a great taste and is highly recommended.

The layout has a great seating area at the rear for groups with the center containing booths and tables for 4. The bar and high top seating complements the front of house with a great patio that can be awesome on a nice warm night.

I have eaten here once before grabbing a GB cheeseburger, as I remember it being  a great tasting burger that was extremely satisfying. The fries that came with the burger were a little dried out and a little tasteless.

High chairs available with a little kids menu to go with.

Overall

Good service 
Clean business 
Decent food
Great beer
I'm no pizza expert, but this place is a small slice of heaven!

Never been much of a pizza bloke as I felt being full by of average crusts and semi cold delivered pizza from the big boys of Pizza, Pizza Hut etc wasn't really healthy or satisfying.

Situated in Boca park next to Cheesecake Factory, Embers and Kona Grill. grimaldi's has a great layout with stool style seating, sit down dining area and a small patio area out the front to boot. The pizza is a Coal Brick oven style that unlike a lot of other places sets up for topping priority tasting dish.

Having been here a few times I've always found the Antipasti a great starter with a nice serving of bread with olive oil and vinegar.

Ordering a Sausage, Pepperoni, Ricotta cheese pizza, the medium size pizza was enough for 3 people easy. Presentation is always top notch and competes with most pizza joints locally.

The service here is prompt but also it can be sometimes a little wait to get a table as it's always fairly busy most day\/nights of the week. 

One of the only cons is even though they had high chairs for children, the menu didn't really have much flexibility for what the little ones can be served. I asked if they had a pasta dish that could be served in a smaller portion but the server pretty much nix anything that was asked..
Put moar of deez breads in my mouf. 

Turkey pesto sandwich: delicious.
Roast beast sandwich: so good (roast beef was rare, could have used a little more seasoning)

The pumpkin chocolate bread was so, so good. It was more like a pound cake than a normal bread--you could totally eat it for dessert.

I got a sample of caramel apple bread (something like that) and it was also super delish. 

My mom lives in this area and I'm glad, because I will absolutely be back.
Needs serious updating. Nowhere near enough outlets to charge electronics and a lot of the outlets don't work. Also needs additional eating options. The restaurants need better ventilation. I am sitting at gate B15 and I can smell a mixture of Burrito and bagels. One bathroom had hand dryers at counter top level so that when the woman I standing next to was drying her hands, the water was spraying all over me.  I'm surprised that a city that caters to tourists would have an airport in this condition.
Just  had a great dim sum experience.  There were 12 of us for their dim sum lunch on Saturday.  Everyone enjoyed the quality and variety of offerings.  I had called ahead for reservations as I wanted to be sure they could accommodate all 12 of us at one table.  No problem, the table was ready when we arrived.  Having a lazy Susan as the center of the table, makes it easy to distribute the food.  The various carts filled with goodies are continuously circling the room so you can pace your eating and select the things that appeal to you.  All of the food was well prepared and met or exceeded our expectations.  If there is a negative its that with several carts all with different varieties of food, there is too little time between the carts to select and eat before the next cart is there.  All of us enjoyed the experience and several were surprise at how reasonably priced the meal was. Definitely a fun meal.
Poorly designed combination of mall and power center (giant strip mall) with confusing "through streets" in the meandering parking lot and tricky access to and from the freeway.  They've had a LOT of stores close (mostly the mall-type chain clothing stores in "The District") and several restaurants have flipped multiple times (the Irish pub, Cadillac Ranch).  Some places are showing their age already (Dave and Buster's).

One time my family and I circled the entire place on a Saturday night and there wasn't one single parking space open!  Even Chandler Fashion Center will have some spaces (by Sears, heh).  I am NOT a fan of slapping parking in the middle of a retail center, and prefer surrounding parking garages or even the "sea of asphalt" that Chandler Fashion Center has (they were going to build a garage while moving to a more upscale retail mix but that blew up with the recession).  Thankfully, the parking situation near Harkins is pretty simple.

I imagine Tempe Marketplace is nice for locals in the immediate neighborhoods as it gives them big box stores and the movie theater, and they're putting an H&M in to help fix the mass exodus of apparel stores, but between superior super-regional malls (Chandler Fashion Center closer to here for "normal" or Scottsdale Fashion Square for selection and luxury) and the plethora of more convenient shopping centers closer to me, I don't personally have a need to ever go here other than when meeting friends.
We made reservations for brunch on Christmas morning. This place is not something you will find by accident. It is hidden away near the Tower Suites.

Our table was not ready when we arrived so we sat down at the bar for pre-brunch drinks. This place has a unique look and feel. It has a lot of character. We ended up with a table in the round room, up against the glass. It was a very good spot with a view of the pool area.

Throughout our experience the service was very good. Each staff member was attentive and friendly. I ordered the Traditional Eggs Benedict. It comes with the Tableau Potato. The Eggs Benedict was quite tasty. Every component added a nice flavor including the Canadian bacon. They also did a very good job with the presentation aspect of it.

For my beverage I chose a cappuccino. I was not disappointed. It had good flavor and was satisfying.
Came here after trying to get service at a gourmet ice cream\/coffee bar. The staff was helpful and moved the large line quickly. In and out within 15 minutes for a party of 10.  Love this place!!!!
Horrible gel mani\/pedi. It was not only rushed but it was poorly done and the tips were incredibly crooked. Never again will I come here.
This place is a go to place for me. I like their kabab and rice. Lean snd tidy place.
YUM! I've had the split roasted porchetta and porchetta salad and it is so good! 

Split roasted porchetta - comes on a delicious crispy on the outside, soft on the inside bun. This is also beautifully packaged! It is the perfect portion size for me and every bite is so flavorful and you do not feel gross after you've eaten this. The meat is so juicy!

Porchetta salad - comes in a big container with large chunks of porchetta. You have the option of garden greek or ceaser salad. I chose garden and the salad was crispy and not overly dressed with dressing (I loved they went light on the dressing). Meat was generous and delicious!

Great service and decor. 

Recommendation: order ahead so you don't have to wait, they can take a bit of time to make.
Now that was a serious workout. I jogged for almost seven miles over the jagged and slippery terrain. While most people would use the trail for hiking, I wanted to get a challenging run in and so I did. Hiking-wise, I would say this is not a difficult trail, but fun just the same. There are some dangerous drops depending on which trail you take. If I ever make it back to Scottsdale, I would do it all over again.
Vegan sandwiches are one of my favorite things to eat so I was prepared for guaranteed love for this place. But the selection is so utterly uninspired, I had trouble figuring out which option was the least boring. I went with the roasted vegetable, and at $10, I was not super pleased. Would have been better off ordering the ubiquitous "veggie sandwich" of any 'ole place where a sandwich may be purchased. Though, the bread was better than average. According to the counter-staff-person, all of the sandwiches have the same bruschetta topping and tahini dressing, except for the TLT. So my first suggestion for improvement is to make each sandwich more unique by dressing them differently. Special sandwiches "of the day" would also be appealing for those who would be frequent customers. Then, at $10, at least give a small side like some slaw, or even just a pickle spear. And one last thing, potatoes are an unpleasantly weird thing to include on a sandwich. 

I guess this is perhaps an excellent place to get a salad, but I think I'd just pick up fresh veggies from one of the many affordable produce markets in the area and throw that together myself.
Troy is great .. very relaxing environment with a tasty variety of Mediterranean dishes.
*The inside was spacious and not crazy loud in here. 
*I can actually hold a proper conversation and don't have to walk out with a major headache stare at Guu. The atmosphere was relaxing and the staff was super friendly, except they forgot our water until the end of the meal.
*I must mention how I was sitting near the grilling station, and I walked out with 0 smell! So kudos to their ventilation system

-Takara plum wine - $11 (glass)
The Takara plum wine had a sweet, fruity flavor without a strong alcoholic taste. 

-Tori Karaage (japanese style deep fried chicken w\/ house special wasabi sauce) - $12
The deep fried chicken was not oily, still juicy and remained succulent when cold. However it would have been better if there was a bit more batter as I found the chicken's exterior wasn't crispy enough. I really enjoyed the wasabi in the dipping sauce as it added just a kick to the chicken karaage, a delicious combination! The picked ginger and cabbage was a nice addition to tone down the heat as well.

-Taco Wasabi (wasabi marinated octopus) - $8
The octopus was chewy, but hard, slimy (in a good way) and full of wasabi heat without leaving a burning aftertaste in my mouth. The addition of seaweed was quite nice to cut the heat, but as always, more please as there were only 5 pieces

-Set A Yakitori - $16
--Sanmainiku (pork belly): A bit too salty for me but D said it was ok for him. The pork was juicy and not too fatty, just perfect!
--Cheese Mune (chicken breast with cheese): The chicken was dry and bland. The cheese didn't really help either.
--Eringi (king mushroom): King mushroom don't have much flavor so it needs a lot of "help." Again this was bland..
--Karubi (beef strip loin): juicy and just melt in your mouth.
--Scallop: cooked just right and had good seasoning.

-Mochi Bacon (bacon wrapped rice cake) - $5
It was a bit odd to see that the rice cake was dduk (Korean rice cake) instead of mochi. Nonetheless it was probably one of the better skewer of the night. The bacon was slightly crispy and went well with the rice cake without making it too salty.

-Gyu Tataki (lightly seared beef) - $16
I thought the beef pieces were a bit too thick and tough to chew on. Also, isn't this supposed to be served with a citrus-soy dipping sauce? The beef was quite bland so it really needed some kind of sauce to flavor it up!
I came here for lunch on Friday and was very impressed. The staff was really helpful and knowledgeable. Was seated immediately with no wait. The food was just as good. To add, they have both a sushi bar and wine bar. 

Our food came out in a reasonable timeframe in which we both ordered the custom bento boxes. We both enjoyed our meals. I had the firecracker roll and she had the blackened tuna roll which both was really good. I also had the blackened mahi mahi taco which was lacking a little bit on flavor so it was just ok to me. She also had the Mongolian beef which was good and they serve you a lot of it too. 

Overall it's a great sushi spot to hang out at. And what makes it even better, there's a movie theater literally in walking distance.
I left only slightly impressed with District. The atmosphere and decor is fabulous, but the places seems to be insanely larger than it needs to be. I came with a group of approximately 15 and it felt like we snuck in at night for a snack. There was almost no one there - at 8pm on a Friday.

Our service was a little slow, especially towards the end when we were trying to get our bill so we could head to another venue at Arizona Center in time for some geeky karaoke fun. 

I did have a great pineapple muddled drink and the scallops with potato pancakes were delicious. Overall the menu really didn't stand out enough in my mind to force myself another go, but it wasn't so bad I would avoid it.
Vic & Blue are the best!!!Vic & Blue are the best!!! Great costumer service, and amazing personalities. Never fails they know my order whenever I walk in.
Okay, first off, I'm a vegetarian so the only thing I ever order at Mexican restaurant is a bean and cheese burrito with a side of rice.  And this was the most average version since my Taco Bell day's circa 1999.  Margarita's were average too, and our group was disappointed to hear that they don't do pitchers of margarita's anymore.  On a good note, the chips and salsa is great and you get a bean and cheese dip to go with it too.
Dr. Wachtel and staff are top notch. They are professional, friendly and very knowledgeable in their field. I also appreciate their appointment availability including late afternoons and some Saturdays. As a working lady, I need this kind of flexibility to establish a good relationship with any office. 

It is no easy task to walk in to an orthodontist's office as an adult -- it can be intimidating and it is a big step to undergo treatment. Dr. Wachtel is well worth the cost and I am so excited to start my Invisalign adventure!
I love this Subway location because they have pastrami! The employees are always friendly too! If you're ever in the area and want great service (and pastrami) or any other sub go here!
This entire stay was amazing. They have an amazing valet service that is always quick and efficient. There is a small resteraunt and Starbucks at this location. Also a small business center to go online. We got checked in by holly. Our room wasn't ready we had a suite. We explained that we were getting married and needed to get ready and right away she found a room. I really appreciated her hospitality during the whole check in. She made the entire experience amazing. We will definitely be staying here again when in Vegas!
Deux fois par année (automne et printemps), les invités privilégiés de Mtl et les environs deviennent fou à l'idée de cette vente. Pendant plusieurs années, je faisais  ma recherche pour avoir une invitation...et souvent sans succès..mais maintenant cela est chose du passé, car les invitations sont envoyés électroniquement et à notre tour on peut envoyer l'invitation à 2 autres personnes. Attention, chaque invitation donne le droit à y retourner 2 fois et y aller avec une autre personne. De plus, vous ne pouvez pas dépenser plus que 600$ et il y a une certaine quantité de produit à respecter. 

Bref, autrefois la vente accueillait beaucoup moins de gens et les prix valaient vraiment la peine. Maintenant, c'est un peu plus dispendieux...les prix sont bon mais pas toujours des 50-60%. À part les vernis Essi à 2$ OMG!! 
Faites-vous un budget avant d'y aller...car ça monte vite!!! Et n'oubliez pas de prendre un sac à l'entrée...pour pas avoir les mains pleines....les paniers sont difficiles à trouver...
I am not vegan and this place is legit! I have driven past numerous times before venturing into this "health" spot. One day, after being sick for a few weeks, I thought I'd be adventurous and stop in for a fresh juice that might help fight the cold. Man was I in for a treat and it has since become a favorite spot of mine!

Still a skeptic, I thought to myself, "I better try this place a few times before writing a review." Now that I've been several times, I feel like I can truly vouch for this place. I can't believe their meatless dishes are so delicious and flavorful! So far, I have tried the following:

-Hangry Tacos - Really good! Not the largest portion but still a good size. I was full after eating this dish. They looked dry and unappealing but don't let that discourage you from biting in and experiencing all the flavor!
-Raw Tree of Life Salad -- Huge!! Enough to split. So many interesting flavors. I prefer it with their vinaigrette over the tahini dressing.
-Portobello Cheese Steak Sandwich -- I was truly a skeptic of this dish and almost didn't try it. I am SO glad I did. It is by far my favorite dish and I can't wait to order it again.

Most of the juices I tried were primarily selected to help me get over a cold and were full of ginger, beets, carrots, and a few other Vitamin C packed fruits\/veggies. If you want a sweet, yummy juice, the Blue Pom Bomb is really tasty. They can give you great recommendations on juices depending on exactly what you're looking for...

Which brings me to their service. I am so impressed. All the staff I encountered were super friendly and willing to answer any of my questions. They provided excellent recommendations and because of this, I have tried great dishes I wouldn't have selected on my own. 

I also like the layout of this place and it's always clean. They even have a cute, little, comfy corner nook with seating if you want to chill, read, or just hangout. It's also nice they offer both indoor and outdoor patio seating. 

Even if you're not a health nut, one day when you're feeling adventurous, give this place a shot!
I love mangoes because of this place. The mango curry dish is out of this world!!!! Followed by the mango sticky rice. You cannot go wrong here. 

When in Madison, this is a must do!!! If you're lucky enough to live nearby, beware! It can be addicting. 

You've been warned.
This location has the most upmarket men's selection I have found in a TJ Maxx or Marshalls, and you don't have to deal with the ridiculousness of mostly made-for-outlet and private label Off Fifth Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom Rack have degenerated into.

Brands I have seen include D&G, Armani, Corneliani, John Varvatos, Versace Collection, Valentino, Diesel Black Gold, McQ Alexander McQueen, Ralph Lauren black label, and even several Fendi tees and polos!

They even had some (too small for me) off-white Dior Homme pants!

Their underwear selection often has higher-end items too (D&G, Versace), plus lots of Calvin Klein, Michael Kors, and the like.

Several contemporary designer and luxury denim labels are sprinkled in, like theory, Hudson, Joe's, and AG.

They also carry a very wide variety of mid and low brands, from Polo Ralph Lauren to U.S. Polo.  Macy's staples like Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Nautica, Guess, Tommy Bahama, Perry Ellis, and Kenneth Cole are all well represented, plus Adidas, Nike, and Underarmour athletic clothing.

Minus one star for the selection being hit-or-miss and having to share parking with Last Chance.

Note that for some reason, Ralph Lauren anything carries a premium in pricing here.
Recently had lunch at Cosmos Cafe in uptown. I ordered the Steak Frites and wasn't asked how I'd like the steak cooked. It came prepared okay, but the meat was exceptionally gristly.

Food and service alone would be a perfectly average 3-stars. However, we were seated next to some piece of wall art at a two-top. A large flying type of bug (flying ant, maybe?) made it's way onto our table twice, from underneath the wall art. I flicked it to the floor, and about two minutes later, another one emerged from behind the art, hovering next to our table. I could imagine the first one was a wayward insect that had flown in the restaurant, but when I saw a second one I began to suspect that there might be an infestation in the restaurant. I won't be dining at this Cosmos location again.
Stopped in here this evening for a drink. Bar was packed. We managed to squeeze up to the bar and order a drink. We had to take our drinks to a table as there was nowhere at the bar to sit.

The bartender noticed us as soon as we came in. She got us each a drink, although she didn't seem none to friendly about it. She had that I hate my job personality.

Definitely not a friendly vibe in here. Had the feeling if you're not gambling you're not welcome.
Legume is a beautiful restaurant with an extremely quaint and relaxing atmosphere.  You really get the "home comfort" feeling here and the service is great.  The menu being updated basically daily is a definite plus and you can taste this in the freshness of their preparation in the restaurants dishes.  For an appetizer I enjoyed the Chicken Liver and Bacon bits, it was just so perfect an amazing sauce and done on a crostini, the way liver should be presented. For an  Entree I enjoyed their halibut and the girlfriend had the Yellowfin Tuna, both were excellent.  Perfectly tempered, well seasoned and accompanied well.  To speak for the Halibut it was very light but a good portion size and presented well with the summer squash and mushrooms.

The only disappointment was due to the fact that the restaurant prepares all meals fresh and only as many as they think will be served nightly the result is a few dishes selling out for a saturday night.  For example we were unable to try the Beef Tartar because they had just run out half an hour earlier and The Beef Liver entree was sold out aswell.  I grabbed the last Chicken Liver App.  Next visit will be at an earlier time than 8pm to try all this great restaurant has to offer.  One of the best in pittsburgh and a great wines by the glass selection.
The food is super tasty! I made my own waffle + it was cooked to perfection! I also really liked the coffee. The wait staff was friendly and even let us stay past closing to finish our coffee + order dessert without making us feel rushed or rude. Definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the area!
The food was delicious, the service was phenomenal and the price was good! I definitely recommend the penne de pollo.
As you may know, Vietnam was colonized by the French for many, many long years, so it has a French influence (like in the french bread Vietnamese sandwiches made famous by Lee's Sandwiches, which are franchised everywhere). 

So here in Montreal, it is only natural to find many Vietnamese restaurants, just like in France. 

Nhu Y restaurant is known for its Chef, who was trained in French cooking schools in Vietnam. The 2 dishes this restaurant is famous for according to the local Vietnamese diaspora is Canh Chua Ca Bong Lau, or sweet and sour Catfish Soup, which has a great mix of flavors. And the other is their signature appetizer, Chicken Wings, marinated in Nuoc Mam (fish sauce) and crisped up for a great combination of texture and flavor. 

Tres Delicieux!
Literally the best doughnuts, ever. I have now lived in NJ, Philly, Boston, and Pittsburgh and would keep going back to Better Maid if there was one in every location. Please go. Do it for yourself.
I eat at Chima's once a month. Good place if your hungry. Never disappoints. It took me a couple of times to understand what is the best thing to eat. You don't want to stuff your self with bunch of salad or sausages. Be patience and figure out the meat selection. The rack of lamb and the fillet mignon is great. Make sure to check out the upstairs bar. Have a drink before your dinner and enjoy the view:) Free valet
Had the BEST time here with my husband celebrating our anniversary! We had oysters, crab dip, ahi tuna burger, and French sea bass. Everything was phenomenal. The food came out quickly and staff was friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back again!!
Just walked out of this place never to come back! We asked if they were open and the man said yes so we asked if they could do a half hour massage and he said no, so we told him we only had half hour available,  and he said no because they charge for hour. My husband, trying to explain it to him, offered him 20,00 for the half hour (when that's the price for the whole hour), just so I could get a 30 min massage and then he said it wouldn't be possible because they didn't have people to do it - tho he said they were open. Very disappointed. We were not trying to get it cheaper, that's why we offered the full price for a shorter massage but then it went from "we're open" to "we don't have people". 
Also we notice a small sign that show how much you should tip after the massage and the least is 100%, that absurd!! I really DON'T recommend this place.
I am editing my review from a 4 stars to a 1 star because tonight was my final straw of screw ups. I went to Ulta tonight to get some more Redken because it was on sale with that ad they said you also get a free pump (cool, but whatever). So when i went to check out and the cashier is EXTREMELY caddy (like usually here) so i kept our convo short. But when she told me the told it sounded a little high, she seemed in a rush so i checked my receipt when i got home. She put 2 bottle pumps into my bag without telling me then charged me $6 dollars for them! For something i did not want or was told i was being charged for! It would be somewhat ok if this wasn't the second time in the row that they over charged me for something. A few months ago the cashier with the same attitude charged me for the same nail polish 4 times. They really need to teach these girls at the front how to be nice to customers and how to ring up items because it is getting really annoying to be over charged at the same store each time i go. The only thing i will come back for is the Benefit Brow Bar and the salon, at lease those people now how to treat customers.
Crazy. Awesome. Good. I cannot believe it took me this long to try some Short Leash Dogs!!

The truck is adorable and the service is top notch. I don't have to repeat things 50 times and the service is much quicker than I expected.

I ordered the Lady dog which has onions, fried pickles and chipotle cream cheese sauce. I got it on an all beef dog. I added mushrooms to it for something extra.  When I got it, it was piping hot in bread that I think is naan, and if not, is something pretty damn close. It was so good, I didn't want it to end. I didn't want to admit that I had an empty dish in front of me. I wanted to get in line and buy another. But it was enough for a complete meal and I knew I had no one to roll me into my house even if I managed to make it to my car.

It was piping hot, which was good but that combined with the bread made it a little hard to hold. I'm not complaining though. Next time I'll just have to knife and fork it, which is completely fine by me. 

Additionally they have pepsi in a bottle, which is hard core. I'm a fan!
Sephora is always five stars. Blows Ulta out of the makeup supermarket stores ;)
Music just a bit too loud when I was here yesterday, especially at 10am.
Staff is always available for help, well staffed so when you need a sample or a color match it's makes shopping here quite simple.
Now, about that Dyson hairdryer :)  see my picture please!
This was my first time here. When you first walk in the first thing you see are the deli cases, the display cases with the bakery items, and a variety of bagels. They have several different kinds of cream cheese, cakes, pastries, meats, salads, etc. We were told to seat ourselves and a waitress would come to the table. I also noticed there were a few people waiting for take-out at the counter. The menu is huge. It pretty much has everything you would expect at a deli of this size.

I'll go over each item.

Pastrami Ruben: The bread was too greasy from too much butter. The pastrami was definitely not made in house. The sandwich was okay. I probably wouldn't order it again. The fries they serve are pretty awesome though. I definitely like the fries! I also like the cucumber salad they serve on the side. Oh and their deli style pickles are also freakin' awesome!! Great pickles.

Matzo Ball Soup: I never had it before. It was pretty much chicken noodle soup with two dumplings. It was okay, but not something I would order again.

Lox & Bagel: The platter came with the smoked salmon, tomatoes, onion, capers, cream cheese, and bagel. Everything on the platter was excellent except for the bagel. It did not taste like a fresh made bagel. It was more like something from the store. It was not bad, but I was expecting better.

The potato knish and the potato pancake were very good. This was the first time I ever ate a knish. I would probably order it again.

The service was good. Our server was very pleasant. Overall the food was not anything spectacular. Sorry to disappoint all the reviewers who gave them 4 and 5 stars, but I didn't eat anything that made me want to rush back here. It was just okay.
Good food and pretty fast service. But the place smells pretty gross, almost like someone took a dump in ceiling and they never cleaned it out. Floors usually sticky, and tables sticky as well. Dirty plates and glasses for use. Only giving 3 stars because the food is good for take out
Not enough words to write a review for The Palm. Just one of the best steak houses in North America. Sign up for the 837 Club.  Accumulate enough points to get your portrait painted on the wall.
Been a couple times. Basil chicken was a bit salty. Cashew chicken was good. Service was decent. Not bad but likely would prefer other spots in the area.
You know how friends from out of town always ask "What is the best place to eat Poutine in Mtl?" And most of the time people will say "Go to La Banquise!", which ironically is right across from Ma Poule Mouillee. To that question I'd answer ditch the lineup and come wait here instead (yup, lines are long here too). But it's so worth it, trust me. First of all, they don't skimp on meat. It's probably equal parts roasted Portuguese chicken, chorizo and fries. Then there's the spicy sauce. And the San Jorge cheese. Heaven for poutine-a-holics. 

I shared the Louis Cyr (half chicken +fries and salad) and small Poutine with my bf and we were so full afterwards. 

Long lineups, but you can skip the line if you plan a bit ahead and order by phone. Small (10 tables at most) but turnover is pretty quick. If you're only here for the natas then skip the line and head straight to the pastries counter at the back. You won't be disappointed!
aaaaahhh-MAIZE-ing!!! And, no... this place is not over-hyped! This little taco shack on the corner of Green & 1st is life changing. Friendly staff that serve up fresh, hot, flavorful food with smiles! Yes, it is tiny and cramped (bar seating for less than 15 people). Yes, the parking lot sucks. Yes, there are times where the line is out the door and around the building. But it is all worth it!! 

I'd highly recommend the Volcanes. Grilled cheese taco with your choice of meat... It's like a quesadilla and taco had a tasty love baby. Yummy! I really enjoyed the carne asada, pastor and chorizo. The chips and salsa were delicious, too! 

Btw... just found out that they are opening a second location this summer on Chestnut where Luna used to be!

Peace, love & tacos!
If you want the best Kothu roti in town, order from here! I'm obsessed with this dish from the particular location.
I think The Village Spa has a special place in my heart since I came here with my matron of honour just before my wedding for manicures and pedicures.  I quite enjoyed that time, despite being slightly shocked by the price (I go for a pedicure maybe once a year), but when you think about it, pedicures are usually upwards of $50 when you go downtown, so a $45 pedicure uptown isn't that bad.

On this most recent trip, I had a really great time with Tracey.  We chatted through the whole appointment, and she was so personable and a lot of fun.  Most importantly, she did a fabulous job with my nail polish.

Gift certificates to The Village Spa make an excellent gift, which is why I went there in the first place.  Don't forget to take flip-flops and allow for drying time, though $4 for flip-flops isn't bad.  Also, nail polishes are titled by sassy phrases like "I'm not a waitress", not number codes, so if you ask for the colour, that's what you'll get in response!
Great staff,friendly,attentive and clean restaurant. I never come to chili's but decided to for the all day happy hour on sunday.you can't beat the prices and at least you can see some sunshine and not be tempted by any gaming. It was a fun Sunday drinking and eating their nachos and onion jalapeno strings.I'm coming back next Sunday:)
I want to give this place five stars, and I would if some items were cleaned up.  I'll get to that later.  Regardless, I really liked this place during my Friday lunch visit.

I liked the menu.  It was similar to a more hipster place on Shiloh, with a nice selection of burgers, wings, and other "better" munchies.  They also had Lenten specials.  Lots of different draft beers and tons of bottles from what I could see.  The bartender wasn't overly friendly (Problem #1... he seemed not too happy to be at work which is a definite turn off.)  

I ordered a crab sake sandwich, given it was Friday in Lent and it was a staple on their menu I wanted to see what they were workin' with.  I think the crab cake is the "end all be all" of a restaurant--if it is fresh you know the food is good.  If it is a dense puck of breading then you know what the restaurant is like.  It was phenomial.  I got the sweet potato fries which were just so-so (it's hard to find good SP fries, IMO).  The bread that it was served on was SO FRESH that I had a hard time not picking at my pieces.  The portions were reasonable and you could tell the main dish was the star of the show because they side portions were perfect.  

Sitting at the bar was the classic Mt Washington crowd-- the obnoxious frat guys, the mt washington natives, young professionals.  I really liked this atmosphere but Problem #2 is that the obnoxious frat guys kind of turned the environment .  I mean, there is no need to state loudly (for all the bar to hear, at noon-or any time of the day) "Worthless Yinzers" during a conversation with your buddy.  I mean, you really aren't impressing anyone.  

The draft beers are expensive to my no-longer-a-city-dweller perspective, with two beers and a sandwich costing a little over $20, but I would go back again for the food.  It was awesome.
Kim was fantastic - as ALWAYS! She has been my esthetician since January when I NEEDED somebody to help my face! I was pregnant and having terrible hormonal acne. We were very limited as to what treatments she could try on me because of my pregnancy. We did what we could, and after only a short time, the difference was night and day! A complete 180! 

I had a hydra facial for the first time (now that I'm no longer pregnant or breastfeeding) and my face looks like I have new skin two days later!! Most definitely my favorite treatment we've done so far. 

All the staff is always so sweet and get to know you on a personal level so they can have meaningful conversation while you wait. They even remembered my sons name! I will never go anywhere else for my facials, and I will recommend Kim to anybody and everybody! 

Check out some before\/after photos below. 
The first photo was today (two days after my hydra facial), the second was back in April and the third is the two next to one another for easier comparison. I'm not being dramatic when I say Kim has done a complete 180 on my face.
I work in the area so have eaten at this location numerous times.

The location is right across from the Mandalay Bay.

The staff at this location changes constantly. But no matter how often the staff changes you can always count on them being inept. 

If you have to eat here I'd suggest walking inside. The drive through is always a long wait.

The food is typical McDonalds except for their french fries. At most McDonalds I love their fries...not at this place. They're always old and it taste as if they never change the oil in their fryer.  I've never had a good french fry at this place.

If you're really craving McDonalds I'd suggest you try another one.
I just tried  the Humble Lion today. 
I had a regular coffee and my friend tried the Latte erable (Maple Latte) and we were both pleased with our drinks. The coffee had a great flavour and was very fresh. 
It was tough to find a spot to sit because the place was so packed and the cafe doesn't have much seating. We weren't particularly impressed with the barista's attitudes but the great music definitely made up for it. 

Over all, nothing too special, great ambience and decent coffee, I would definitely give the place another try.
I really like this Salvation Army.  They always have a lot of books and a lot of furniture to choose from.  They have 50% off everything on most Saturdays and it is pretty well organized.  I love to browse thrift stores for good finds and I have done well on cookware, dishes and books here.  One thing that is kind of annoying is the back corner is sometimes a mess because of toys and sporting equipment being thrown all over the floor.  This makes it difficult to get to some of the book shelves.
Free books, free movies, free mags, free wifi, comfy chairs with foot stools, self checkout, drive thru pick up and drop off, coffee, very separate children's area...ahhh....true love.  

First off, the building is gorgeous with a zen-like front outdoor sitting area complete with the sound of running water.  It's open and airy, and just a relaxing place to be.  The set up is great - children have their own area with plenty to look at and explore, while adults have their own place to study or enjoy a book in some peace and quiet.  Definitely my favorite Scottsdale library, and yes, I've been to them all.   

Note:  You may want to avoid after school from around 3:30 - 6:00pm....those kiddies from across the street can get noisy, giggly, and sometimes obnoxious.
Great place for intimate dinners romantic dinners great atmosphere clean the waiters and waitresses are awesome the bartender is great the food was phenomenal
So my date and I stopped by for a late dinner. It wasnt busy in the resturaunt or bar yet it was still noisy. Odd. Our server was adequate and made frequent visits. The burger took a while and I imagine it's because I ordered everything and the kitchen sink on my burger:  i.e. 1\/2 lb angus beef with sautéed onions, peppers, mushrooms; pickles, lettuce, jalapeños, onions, tomatoes, bacon, pineapple, fried egg, cheeses: cheddar, provolone, jack, Gruyere, and Swiss; bbq sauce on an artisan bun. My date played it smart and ordered a few items on her burger. She subbed in fries instead of homemade chips for a couple of $$. 
Overall, the meal was rather ordinary, my burger as well. I would rate it 2.5 out of 5 stars. My date's burger bun ripped at first bite and the tangy chipotle sauce was more like bbq sauce. It seems like a glorified sports bar that charges more $$$ for their food. 
Fortunately, I already have one of those that I like. 

Tip:  Wednesday's are Create your own burger night with any\/all toppings for $12.
This was the first place in Charlotte my guy went to get his hair cut. With all the glowing 5-star reviews, we figured this would be an awesome place. I guess you get what you pay for... $10 is definitely VERY cheap but the cut wasn't good. The neckline was crooked (my biggest pet peeve!) and the lady, while very talkative and nice, was really rough when cutting. Maybe it was a fluke but we won't going back.
I'll keep this short and sweet- I came with a friend for HH one night and liked the vibe, food and service. The sushi rolls here are above average and I liked the variety. The surf and turf roll was really delicious and I would recommend it. The prices here were pretty high so be prepared.
I came here last weekend and had a great meal. We sat at the sushi bar and the bartender (I can't remember her name but she was pregnant) was absolutely fantastic. She was super quick and we had wanted mules but she didn't have anymore cups. As soon as one turned up she brought us mules .... on the house! So kind! We enjoyed a lobster role and some tuna sashimi which was to die for. So fresh and delicious. I had such a great night, my boyfriend wanted to come back the following night so it was a winner in my bo
Was in town for CES -- this place was magnificent! The bone in ribeye was one of, if not the best, that I've ever had.

The one 'vice' I have about this place is that they only served a sweet\/chocolate bread and an olive bread. For someone who is a huge bread connoisseur  was pretty disappointed that there wasn't a nice crusty sourdough or even just a baguette.. Their breads were disappointing.

Would I come back? Absolutely. The price was definately better than any of the casinos, and you don't have to listen to the slots in the background (+1 takes care of the bad bread)
Classic 2012 Halloween brawl WSHH (youtube.com\/watch?v=1XoT6VQE0q8). 

Good tasting pho (get the 101 or 102, don't get the meat balls one) and vermicelli. Their service is usually pretty fast so no complaints there. Pretty dirty but standard for Chinatown. Try to get the booths\/seatings right next to wall, it helps with enjoying the food. 

For drinks get the avocado shake, its actually prettyyyy good.

Note: Substitute for egg noodle is free for all the pho items. Be sure to get it if you hate wide rice noodles.
The kitchen was backed up, the service was very slow, but the bloody Mary's were great. The food was very pricy and they charge extra for everything and th don't tell you. will we will not ever go back there again except for a drink
My go to coffee place when I'm around college-spadina. I love their coffee, but I love their food more.

They have these earl grey cookies, which is not too sweet and makes a perfect weekend treat. Their paninis are also good. While it's not at the level of Nadege sandwich, it is still one of the best in Toronto. It tastes like one of those artisan-made sandwich that you'd expect from an artisan bakery.

This place seems to be quite active and have a lot of events. It also seems to be where writers gather. Can't blame them when the atmosphere is that good. It's a cozy and homey hole in the wall kind of place.
I have not been here in a long time. The last time I went it was still called Gonoe. Have not been back often because the service was not the best. We use to come here for the unique dishes like live octopus and flounder sashimi, which were both very fresh and good. I recently went because I needed a quick lunch. Lunch on a weekday was pretty packed. I decided to order take out and it was prepared pretty quickly. Also, the lunch specials were a great deal with a lot of variety. I got the roll bento box and it was $10.95 with 6 pc of california roll, 6 pc of crab roll, 3 pc of spicy salmon roll, two pc of tofu, and small serving of japchae. I have ordered something similar at the Markham location, but the quality here is so much better. In addition, I ordered a spicy salmon handroll and it was nicely packed with salmon and not too much rice. Lastly, if you pay cash you get a 10% discount. Will definitely be coming back!
I love sushi. I love Sakana. First off, their sushi is typically on point. I've only ever had one item I disliked and that's the seabass. Not a fan. One item that's a must have is their house smoked salmon nigiri. Holy effing awesome. I always want to eat like a dozen orders of that stuff. 

The best reason of all for Sakana though, is that they are open on Sundays and have a happy hour. For some reason I am always craving sushi on Sundays and there is a huge lack of good places open. Sakana saved me and I will return the favor by telling of its awesome.
James helped me with a problem I had with a frame.  He was courteous, professional, friendly, and solved the problem in a very timely manner.  I highly recommend him and the great customer service he provides.  Thanks James!
THEY RUINED MY WEDDING! 

I do not recommend this "bridal boutique" to anyone! If I could rate this i would rate this place a -1000 
They caused me so much unnecessary stress and tears. 

1st. I ordered my gown 12 months in advance to avoid stress. And 6 months before my wedding they give me a call saying they lost my gown and then told me HELEN the previous manager STOLE MY GOWN! 
SHE STOLE MY GOWN. VEIL, AND SASH! 

2. They told my they'd order me a new one but didn't offer a rush at first. And when they did they made it seem like they were doing me a tremendous favor. When they should have covered that regardless. LINDSAY told me me that the designer MIA SOLANO herself was going to personally make my gown herself. 

3. When the 2nd gown came in, it looked horrible! It was made poorly and it was then When I was told that the warehouse made it AND that they aren't perfect. 

4. They had to order me A 3RD WEDDING GOWN 4 MONTHS BEFORE MY WEDDING! 
4 months with no guarantee that it would be perfect like the 1st one ( the one that got stolen UNDER their watch)

At this point I was furious, 4 months before my wedding and I had no wedding dress! I had to re arrange my alterations and that was difficult to Do! 

LUV bridal inconvenienced me, my family, my fiance, they are liars, they are UNRELIABLE, UNPROFESSIONAL,  and  will refuse to DO THE Right thing. 

They only care about the money and not about the bride and the customer service. 
God forbid something goes wrong they will try to make you feel responsible for their mistakes and treat you horrible afterwards. They don't own up to their mistakes, and if it was easy for my gown to get stolen who's to say your wedding dress won't get stolen or given to the wrong bride. 
Their management is horrible. And security system is also horrible. 
I had to call them to get my refund which they did not process until a week later. They will tell you they are offering a great deal and doing you a favor when I. Reality, they do nothing for you. 

PLEASE AVOID
This place if you want to save yourself the extra stress, tears, heartache. The way things are managed are poorly, UNPROFESSIONAL and a shame.
Awesome turtle cheesecake cupcake. It was delicious!!! Nothing else has to be said beyond that.
Oh yeah!!!! (Pause for dramatic effect)

I'm going to make this short because there are enough reviews about how awesome this place is. In fact I had seen about 3 police cars pull up as I was walking out, you know it's good !!!

Fat Elvis is pretty much the greatest donut ever made. In fact any of these donuts are top notch!!!! I'm not gonna lie, the best donuts in Nevada, actually prob the west coast United States!!

Now opened 24\/7.... You can't go wrong with a fresh pink box (donut)

Ok one bad thing is your waist will be destroyed by this place, but at least you'll be fat and happy
Went for Friday happy hour with a good friend.  Absolutely loved it.  Tried two of the 3 oz samples (Spanish wines, I believe).  Then asked the bartender for a recommendation -- an outstanding Italian red.  We had the hoppy pickles, chorizo and some manchego.  Delish, especially the pickles.  My total bill was $23 before the tip -- such a good deal.  We'll be back!
I had a photo shoot done here with Scott Hays Photography and also took an acting class here with Linda Waymire. The space is well designed and bright in a great location. Susan the photographer who holds the lease is extremely nice. She specializes in pet photography. As a space it's wonderful. As my experiences here in this space is with Linda Waymire and Scott Hays Photography, I will be reviewing them under separate and their own individual reviews.
I'm not sure how to review this place.  The service my friend and I got was excellent.  The appetizer we had (I can't remember what it was called - veggies breaded with various dipping sauces) was delicious, but they didn't have any eggplant parmesan left (that was the dish I really wanted).  So, I ordered a garlicky pasta dish.  It was tasty, but unfortunately I felt sick all night.  I know it wasn't the appetizer because the friend I dined with had no problems whatsoever.  Perhaps if I'd gotten the meal I wanted, I wouldn't have been sleepless until 5:30 am because I felt like I was going to throw up.  I've never had a bad experience at TCF before, so I'm going to view this as a fluke happenstance.  All the same, I don't intend to dine at this particular locale again.
Been coming to their service department since purchasing my new 2013 Prius. Outstanding customer service and Ricardo in sales made my buying experience great.
I thought this place was too good to be true for a while. Cheap drinks, good food, great service...O.H.S.O. is the total package. They have an amazing selection of beer and a great happy hour ($6 for a pitcher?!) We love their dog-friendly patio, especially during the winter\/spring months in AZ. Brunch on the weekends is also fantastic. $10 for your meal and a monster mimosa. LOVE this place!
Sandra Morals was an outstanding employee for this establishment. Its always good to have an employee who shows pride and enthusiasm for their job.
Called and Daniel arrived within forty minutes! He's friendly and did the job quickly! A+++++ 
Had a number of questions for him and Daniel did not mind checking everything out! Filters, filters, filters ;)  showed me some quick, helpful tips so I don't need a plumber! 
Go Daniel!
I have given this place 3 chances to get it right for me and unfortunately, they struck out! I think the service is attentive yet their employees are annoying and try too hard to keep a conversation. I appreciate the "Hi, how's your day going?" but these guys just take it to another level...and not one I'm comfortable with I guess. I do not like the fact it is drive thru only and that you can't go in and sit down. Isn't that what a coffee shop is supposed to be? Most importantly, I just do not like their product.

I have tried 2 of their infusion teas and their chai tea latte. The first tea I tried was a green tea mixed with blackberry and pomegranate syrups. I thought it was very watered down and didn't taste sweet enough. The second tea was also a green tea but had raspberry and pomegranate syrups. This tea was too sweet and just not good. I went again and decided to get their chai tea, which is my favorite tea, and was extremely underwhelemed. It tasted like their was NO chai tea at all, absolutely no spice whatsoever...all I could taste was the milk and maybe a little honey. Honestly, it was the worst chai tea latte I've ever had! 

Maybe if I only wanted a cup of coffee, this place would do it for me. But, I don't like coffee and like trying coffee shops for their teas and lemonades. Overall, this place just doesn't impress me at all and I would much rather spend my money at Starbucks or a local coffee shop.
We love this place! I only dock a point because the salad bar is plentiful but weak in quality. But, it is *only* the salad bar- the real quality is in the stir fry. Mix together your own bowl of meat, veggies, and sauces- then watch them splash it on a hot grill and cook it to your liking. You get to control your own quantities within each bowl, so it doesn't end up mostly veggies like most Chinese delivery places. You can go one bowl or unlimited. For unlimited it is absolutely worth the price. Both options include the salad bar, which has soup, salad, and fruit.
Arrived for an early dinner! One other customer and us. The chips and salsa were good and bad. First basket warm fresh and especially tasty with the house salsa. Second basket cold stale and left in the basket. Service was also good and bad. Our order was taken promptly and served equally as fast. Unfortunately, we waited longer for our check and to cash than it took to order and get our food. The Carmallita's Burrito was ordered with shredded chicken and was very satisfying. The Tequila Burrito was prepared with chicken breast with a smokey mesquite sauce. The chicken was diced so small it was crunchy and the lack of sauce made the dish a solid "2 stars". Inconsistencies made our experience a 2.5 star experience but...it is what it is!
Headline: Simple, little fro yo shop. 

Almost too simple for my taste. 

They were closed last time I tired to visit. I found out that they were remodeling. I learned they recently changed ownership. The interior is small. They had a list of fro yo flavors on a chalk board. Some of them said scoop next to the flavor. I was confused, so the guy at the counter clarified that they actually scoop the fro yo out of a container. That's a first for me. I tried the original tart and the peanut butter chocolate, which was scooped. I didn't much care for the texture of the scooped fro yo. The original tart was nice and tart so I went with that. I wasn't the largest fan of the texture. A bit too icy for my taste. Their pricing is set by size but I didn't like how they charge 50 cents per topping. A cup of fro yo can get pricey quick that way. I was intrigued by the taro mochi but disappointed after trying it. Way too gummy in texture and, except for being purple, didn't remind me of taro at all.

I'd be willing to try them again next time I'm up in Noda, but they don't make my list of favorites for fro yo. 

Note: Seating is a challenge and the sidewalk outside the shop gets really crowded when it's busy.
Amazing start to finish. I brought wine for my date and I and I don't know if they just forgot or were nice to us being locals, but we weren't charged a corkage fee. Everything was delicious. I couldn't pick a fave!
We've been bringing our gorgeous Great Dane for several months now, and have been pretty impressed with the dog park.  The grass is still green and it's kept quite clean.  Thank you City of Chandler!

Plus, they have a clearly posted sign that children 12 and under are not allowed and I've seen the police actually enforce that law!  It's a great, much needed law since I've seen children under 8 come in and take off running through the park with their dog, only to have 5 other dogs chase after them too.  Come on parents - get a clue!!  I don't want to be held responsible if my Great Dane tramples a child that's running at high speed!
I've lived in Vegas nearly 40 years and have seen man;y shows over that time. 

This was the worst I've seen. Boring Boring Boring. I guess for being in a major hotel I expected a lot more out of it.

I've seen smaller shows in smaller venues that were more entertaining. They were probably less expensive to put together put at least it was fun seeing the performers put their all into a low budget production.

I spent a fair chunk of the show visiting with the bartender. He was more entertaining than the show.

Don't waste your money on this show. From a local I can tell you for a fact that there are much better ways to blow your money in this town.
Corny statement of the day: I've never actually had a second cup at Second Cup.

Your average Second Cup with about a dozen tables and a few armchair sections. 

Really nothing to say except it's a good location to plug-in if you're in the area, as it's relatively quiet with plenty of room and power outlets. 

Not sure what Jenn K is referring to when she says it's one of the better ones, 'cause food and bevy wise, it's your typical Second Cup fare. There's also a Starbucks (@ the Chapters) and a Tim Hortons around the corner if you prefer those flavors of Joe.
Bollywood Bites is both so wonderful, and so ghastly messed up that it's hard to write a proper review that reflects how wildly it swings to both sides of the spectrum.

I happened to be driving right past the location today so I stopped in to pick up some chaat, just a quick little snack. It is indeed nearly impossible to find the restaurant. Just when you're about to give up, drive 100 feet farther and it's on your left.

The woman in the front was nice and smiled a lot, but understood very little I asked, so I just went with an order of Samosas and an order of Aloo Tiki. She told me, "No credit card." I said fine, that I'd brought cash.  She said she would go drop off my order in the kitchen and come ring me up.   I stood at the counter for five minutes before I decided to sit in one of the plastic chairs. I realized she wasn't coming back for awhile.

She brought out my food about ten minutes later and told me it would be $7. I handed her a $20. She went in the back, then came back and asked me if I didn't have $7 exactly. I said I didn't, and asked if she'd take a check or something. (Lots of miming with my checkbook here.) She shook her head and made a phone call. I spent another 5-10 minutes waiting while she was in the back with my $20 trying to figure out what to do with it.

Finally she came back to the front and went over to the cash register, that had been ignored throughout this whole time. While still on the phone she tentatively pressed a button twice and *woosh!* the cash register drawer flew open and her eyes lit up. Yes, she had to make a phone call to figure out how to get change for a $20.

I left, amused at how screwy this place was and expecting never to return. Then I got home, and I tried the food. 

Here's the deal, the Aloo Tikki was the most flavorful Aloo Tikki I've ever had in my life. The Samosas were incredible. It is quite clear that there is a master in the kitchen at Bollywood Bites.

But it is equally clear that the management of this little hole-in-the-wall restaurant is horribly inept. Both from the reviews here, and from my own personal experience trying to simply order $7 worth of food from them. 

Whoever is running the show has made a series of bad decisions and wrong turns. The location is terrible. The lack of tables is ridiculous. Leaving a woman to manage the orders who can't communicate and doesn't know how to open a cash register is laughable.

I don't know whether to love Bollywood Bites or hate it. I am absolutely sure I will be back to try more of the delicious food, but I won't get too attached to the restaurant. It just doesn't feel like a place that's going to be there more than a couple of years at the rate it's being managed.
Unlike Hello Bistro, I was not impressed with Delicious Raw.  I've been wanting to try this place out since it opened, and I finally made it over only to be enormously disappointed. The staff was friendly enough, but my smoothy was horrible! I couldn't even finish it, and for $8, I was pretty unhappy about not drinking every last drop.. but I just couldnt. I have a pretty well rounded and cultured taste for food and drink, and I just didn't love.. or even like.. delicious raw.   I'll admit that some of my colleagues have been there a time or two and seem to have a different opinion, but for me, it was a no go, and a never again.
Nice classy, perfect spot for catching up with the bestie. Bellini's, Mimosa's and Bruschetta Assorted Board was Divine.
Stumbled upon this one day - thought I would give it a try.

Typical sushi place - sushi was pretty good. Price is decent.

Party trays are decent. =)
I'm going all in on this one. And it is due to more than just amazing food. Our server was a professional--that was clear from the start. We ordered a date milkshake to split and the lovely young lady brought us our milkshake to share divided between two cute glass drinking cups, each with its own spoon and straw. Now that is what you call service. I was very pleased. I was even more delighted after I tasted the concoction, which easily rates 5 stars in my book. Rich vanilla ice cream with bits of dates throughout, giving the shake a little taste of heaven in every sip. Yum. 

I ordered the Louisiana Shrimp Burger. This was my second visit to Flipside, but I had not been there in over a year, I would say. The burger was divine. Succulent shrimp in a thick patty form, with pickles, a tomato, and lettuce. The only things that were less than great I avoided. These were 1)a fried green tomato that looked to be overly greasy. Because my stomach reacts unwell to greasy fare, I de-fried it by removing the breaded and fried part of the green tomato. The other qualm was a creamy sauce on the side that came with the shrimp burger. I do not like cream sauces and so I passed on that puppy. 

Otherwise this place rocks. Will return.
Came here to avoid having to cook for a night... best idea ever! I ordered the 12in Big "EZ", which had steak, bacon and chiptole sauce.  You get to choose from a variety of ingredients to include in your sandwich.  I ended up getting so much in it that the sandwich couldn't even close! The sandwich was a bit pricey $16 or so I believe, but it tasted great so no complaints there. I'd say a 12in would be able to feed 2 ppl who eat less, but if you're coming here alone I'd suggest getting the 8in.
Should be called house of deliciousness!

I could go on and on about this item, that item, blah blah blah but I dont really waznt to. This is good food, done creatively, and in my mind presented in a casual yet sophisticated manner without any pretensiousness. The chef here creates inspirational dishes that seem to meld asian and southwestern flavors seemlessly. Ok so now I realize this are not all real words but after eating here and developing a drunken state of mind who really cares anyhow?

The lowdown is the food is good and priced fair for what you get. Our service was great and on top of everything we truly had an amazing time on a rainy Saturday evening. Next time hopefully we can enjoy the killer outdoor bar and patio seating.
I cant wait to go back and eat our way through the new menu.

The custom cocktails were delightful and the wine list is pretty spot on.
Came here for a birthday dinner and it was good.  The restaurant is clean and the service was on point.  I ordered the veal parmesan with the pasta side.  The veal was crispy and the pasta was the perfect texture.  The price was reasonable ($22).  I also got the Nodine, these were very good, crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  I look forward to coming back for more pasta soon!
I would recommend reservations, especially during peak hours on weekends. The line system they have for walk ups is a little inefficient. That being said this is a good casual option.

The decor is cool, and well appointed. Once we were sat the experience was very good. Our server was attentive and friendly. Our seat was conveniently on the outer edge so we got to do some quality people watching.

For my meal I ordered the Huevos Rancheros with no black beans. It consisted of a crisp tortilla topped with chorizo, cheddar cheese and Hickman's Farms eggs. It was a good brunch sized portion. The flavors combined together nicely. I am a little biased though as I do love chorizo.
Cute visit to this ranch the weekend before Halloween. I brought my 18mo old to pick out a pumpkin and see the sights. She went crazy for the petting zoo (we might be adopting a pig one day) and she liked the hay maze too.

We arrived right at 9am when they opened which I was pleased with. Not only was it still hot that day but by the time we left around 10:30, it was very busy. Pumpkins are picked out a short hayride\/train ride from the main premises. If you have really little ones, it's probably not the most convenient but it was fine for toddlers.

We'll go back next year!
We decided to try out Strip House since we were going straight to Peep Show after.  I always forget it is there since it is upstairs.

The ambiance and decor are nice.

The service was good.  Our server was attentive and friendly.

We started with the Warm Garlic Bread.  It is long rectangular strips of fried bread.  It comes with a Gorgonzola Fondue for dipping.  The taste and texture of the bread is great.  The fondue is creamy and mild.  We all enjoyed it.

The house bread basket comes with three types of bread.  I only tried the pretzel bread, but it was excellent.  The others seemed happy with the other two options.

I chose the 8 oz. filet for my main course.  It was prepared as requested, medium rare.   The meat was tender and tasty.  The seasoned salt and pepper crust gave it added flavor and texture.

We ordered a couple sides.  The Potatoes Romanoff were tasty with nice contrasting textures.  The others tried the Steamed Asparagus and told me it was good.

They have diverse options for wine.  They also offer some unique mixed drinks.
So I went here tonight after reading some reviews.  It is always hard to sell a new place to my husband, he is super picky.  We went and there was a nice ambience as you enter. We got menus right away. Getting water and drinks took a little longer. There were only 4 groups there with one being a larger group. The service was a little slow but they treated us nicely.  

We will start with the appetizer. Muenster cheese and chorizo fondu with 4 mini loaves of pretzel bread with a squirt of spicy mustard in one corner.  We all loved it and my husband kept getting more even after the pretzel bread ran out.

We then went into dinner. The daughter had the spinach, kale, & quinoa salad. She ate it up and enjoyed it, I tried it and liked it.  The husband had the wedge with steak and actually used the word good when describing it.  I had the Sonoran filet with asparagus, fingerling potatoes, portobello mushrooms with a chili coulis. Every bite was delicious. Everyone had a bite and loved the flavor in the chili coulis.

It was a little pricey but the food was good and the husband said we should go back. This is high praise from him.
I've been seen in Beanscene before, supping a post-work brew with a friend. On that occasion, I rather enjoyed the wood, the worn leather sofas, the summer sunlight through a glass wall that opens wide onto the street on hot days. We didn't stick around long but I wondered what it would be like for a spot of breakfast one morning. Having done some heavy suitcase-lugging before work today, I popped in to find out.

Friends: sadness ensues.

I was met with sullen weariness by the girl at the counter. Bearing in mind that it was only 9.15am, I can't in all fairness put it down to "maybe she had had a bad day" as I ordinarily might. Having placed my order - tea and a bacon sandwich, please - I went to sit down, opting not to sit in the big comfy sofa but instead by the (closed) glass wall to watch the morning go by for a few minutes.

A goodly number of these minutes later, the young lady plonked my tea in front of me and wordlessly turned away to straighten the cushions on the sofa. "Excuse me," I asked her back, tentatively. "Is there any sugar?"

She pointed. "Over by the trash."

Ah. I trundled over and picked up a couple of sachets, noting that it was, indeed, in an intimate spatial relationship with the greasy, flip-lid bin.

The arrival of the bacon sandwich was as unceremonious as that of the tea. Two slices of floppy granary bread appeared before me, with something baconish-looking just discernible between them, and a knife. Perhaps it's out of consideration for those who are fussy about triangles\/rectangles, but otherwise I shouldn't have thought it was beyond a cafe to cut one's sandwich before delivering it.

The bacon itself would have been good - nice and crispy - but it was cold; there are a few tricks to a hot bacon sandwich, one of which is not using ketchup straight out of the fridge. This sandwich was a glum disappointment.

I am reminded that I had a nice enough time here when just having a cup of tea in the summer, but that memory is, alas, insufficient to cheer my grieving inner breakfaster.
I have enjoyed this bowling alley for many years and it was also a frequent hang out for when I was in middle school! It has gotten a lot more trendy and commercial with time but that is to be expected, the shoes are always kept up very nice, there is no shortage in bowling balls, their food is spectacular and the people are pretty nice too! The lanes have been kept up very well! They also have an arcade in the building as well as a bar for lanes or an entire bar for just bar goers! That is pretty gosh-darn nifty! The bar is a little more towny and also has karaoke on some nights (Friday night when I was there) but they have a cool loft with 2 pool tables and 2 dart boards. It was a lot of fun! This place has to be one of the nicer bowling alleys i've been to in my time and I will always come back to good 'ol Ten Pin. Oh... one another thing... it is $11 for 2 games... Which, is kind of a lot but isn't the end of the world, Friday nights there are also $1.50 miller and bud taps! So it can work itself out!
It's good. As much as I love my desserts I was excited to try the famous Spinkles cupcakes. I guess since they are the reason why cupcakes became an overwhelming trend, everyone that has opened up a bakery up'd the goodness level. So what I'm trying to say is that, I've had better. Lol
I've been meaning to try this place since our family live close by but it was always so packed that we did not get to try it until today. We wanted to see what the fuss is all about. 

If you go here on the weekends, expect a longer wait time. We waited for a table for around 45 minutes even though we were advised that it will only be a 20-minute wait. When we were finally seated, we were attended to right away. I liked the motif of the interior especially the spinning umbrellas on the ceilings. Our food came out right away, which was great. I ordered the corned beef hash - a classic, how can you mess that up. The flavor is better than most breakfast places that I have tried but I do not like the texture. It was chopped ham with onions and mashed potatoes (supposedly hash brown). It was a little disappointing. Everything else that we ordered were meh. Nothing really stands out. The waffle was too doughy. The orange juice tasted like it was not freshly juiced and it was a little sweet like it was mixed with concentrate (this is just my guess). 

I would still recommend this place. I might come back and give it a second opinion, maybe try their steak and eggs or their pancakes. I think since Rise and Shine is really the ONLY breakfast place in the area (I mean you can get breakfast food at The Lodge except it's a bar), a lot of people would be willing to wait for a table here. I personally think it was not worth the wait. They need to open more breakfast places in this side of town.
So many people told us that the pool parties were the place to be so we decided to check out Rehab on Sunday. I was a little nervous at first because everyone was saying that you have to dress to impress (makeup, jewelry, hot bathing suits with high heals, etc) and that if you didn't then you wouldn't make it in. Nerveless we decided to just see what happens. So we got there about 30 minutes after it opened and there was a 45 minute wait. Lucky it was just the two of us so we got pulled out of the line and brought up front making the wait only 5 minutes. The price to get in was $30 for guys $20 for girls (yes just to walk into the pool area) and $5 for a locker. Luckily we found two chairs right by the pool that were free!!!! (You usually have to pay $200 for a chair). The drinks were awesome and so was the food. We spend the whole day laying out and dancing to the DJ. As far as the people who were there it was about 50\/50. 50% were average and the other 50% were wearing nothing with stripper high heals and their make up and hair done like they were going to a photo shoot. They were right; it was defiantly the hottest pool party in Vegas!
I usually come in twice a year.  Chain places have never been my thing (unless it's those Golden Arches and I need those fries).  
It's busy, but doesn't mean it's A+.  I've been seated in the patio, at a table inside or at the bar.  Service is always mediocre, as well as the food. 
That's all I can really write about it. It's simply just there. As for this location in Town Square, I gravitate more towards that whiskey place across the way:)
Ok, I get it. Woodman's is cheap. Still, it's not worth the filth and the long lines. I want my groceries from a clean establishment.

See you at Cub.
A friend lives out this way, so I ventured over  here.  I'm a fan of this theater now! Four stars, no recliners. What can you do ha!  
First off, the staff has friendly personalities. Meaning, I can't say that for some their theaters in town. Clean, fresh popcorn and enough theaters for all the movies currently and not so currently out:)  Starbucks coffee, Coca Cola (that's a minus for me, I'm a Pepsi drinker).  Great sound system and last night's showing of the Sausage Party was not crowded. Heads up parents, this 'cartoon' movie is not for children. Note the 'R' rating.
Came here a couple nights ago to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Had their happy hour menu out in the patio area.

My friend and I split some dishes.  We had the soft shell crab sandwich, the beef sandwich, and the sea bass skewer from the robata grill.  All tiny portions for $5 . . . and that was fine with us since the quality and flavor of each dish was EXCELLENT.  

We were very happy with our selections and talked about coming back to sample the rest of the dishes on the happy hour menu!
The most amazing, delectable, savory pile of bullshit I've ever attempted to obtain sustenance from. Right now I'm laying in my bed upstairs in the Rio, writhing around in pain due to the almost certain food poisoning ill be receiving from my $35 dog slop courtesy of the carnival world buffet. After writing this review ill probably try to go throw up to get these disease-ridden, rancid animal carcasses out of my body that they try to pass off as edible food. 

I found a duck tooth in the serving tray, mentioned it to my friend, and an employee hurriedly ran over and tried to hide the fact that one of these foul, rotten pond creatures had lost a molar in my dinner to be. 

Our waiter came over and was touching the food on my plate with his bare hands in an attempt to give me some unwarranted advice on opening the soggy, atrophied crap they were calling crab legs.

Our server sat me one foot away from a pile of trash and crab detris the size of a dinner plate on the bench seat next to where I was supposed to be able to eat, which of course was impossible due to the rancid fumes coming off this bullshit.

What topped off my terrible experience was looking across the dining hall and seeing a server with his hand deep down the back of his pants, scratching his ass crack, after which he got right back into handling food and drinks. 

Ohh yea, forgot to mention that they let some snobby old woman bring her little dog into the restaurant, just to have it shit all over the place and not get cleaned up for 20 minutes. 

I'm very surprised the rio is still allowed to be open and hasn't killed anyone yet. Ohh wait, that will probably be me in 30 mins. My last words on this earth will be to prevent any would be patrons from dining here. The Rio's World Carnival Buffet is the sickest, most diseased, foul crap I've ever laid my eyes upon
I"ve seen many movies here. The place is always spotless. Staff is friendly, prompt and courteous.

Never a problem here. I"m sure I"ll be back many times.
We were in the neighborhood and my husband hit Yelp to try to find a good place for lunch. Las Margaritas' 4 and 5 star reviews stood out. It was Cinco de Mayo, and Mexican seemed like an ideal choice.

The menu is good, and the lunch specials are available even on weekends. We each ordered one of the lunch specials for $5-$6. My husband ordered the Arroz con Pollo (his standard) and I tried a dish new to me... "Chilaquile" or something like that. I was in it for the tomatillo sauce. Kind of like an open faced burrito with corn tortillas.

The beer was cold. The salsa (both a veggie based slaw-type salsa and a regular thin medium tomato-based salsa) was good. The chips were fresh and warm. Our food was excellent, and portion sizes were generous for the prices we paid at lunchtime. Service was fantastic and a great soccer game was on the telly.

For me, a 5-star rating means there's nothing I can find fault with or suggest improvement upon. Las Margaritas is a humble strip mall Mexican restaurant that serves delicious food at great prices and with attentive service. For what it is, I can suggest nothing at all to improve upon. If we're ever in the neighborhood, we'll be back!
Best place for Korean confort food! Have not been in years but food and service is still great! The Chicken Dakgalbi with cheese and ramen was the best combination!!
If you are looking for a non-casino hotel near the strip this is a good choice.  It is just south of Mandalay Bay.  The rooms are good and there is a full kitchen.  If you are looking to save money on meals this would be helpful.

The breakfast was barely ok.  The food was bland and there is a severe lack of options.  I did see a man load up a huge tray of food to take back to his room.  He should have been thrown out, but I had no such luck.

There is a shuttle to the strip but it ends at midnight.  That is not helpful at all.
Call me weird, but I have an issue with long toe nails. It weirds me out. So when I went in for a pedicure appointment with DeAnna and was hoping for some minx, which looks better on long toe nails, she was up front with me and let me do a custom glitter bling job instead. Not only did she mix up a glitter just for me (I'm sure the color isn't hard to guess), but she gave me the extra to use at home!!!

Great service and such an adorable place, Downtown Scottsdale Hair & Nails will definitely pamper you and make you feel at home!!
I tried to make an Online Walmart purchase for a tv stand on behalf of my brother in law.
It was the worst, most unprofessional experience I have ever encountered in recent memory. The employee's were helpful and respectful but are hamstrung by a dysfunctional system. I never received the table and could never get a definitive answer as to the status on two different attempts. What they say will happen Online is absolutely not true, the tracking system is useless and the notification system is non existent. I do not recommend an Online Walmart transaction to anyone and will be saying so at every opportunity.
I was a member for over 2 years. I signed a personal training contract. Over the course of the past year I have been through 3 trainers who have quit or who were fired. The trainers were excellent and knowledgable. After the 3rd one left I was fed up with the turnover. I contacted the Arrowhead training manager to be let out of my remaining training sessions. My schedule had drastically changed after starting a new business and it was increasingly harder to make it on a regular basis. Add to that the thought of starting all over again with yet another trainer. I was told by the manager Brian that he would speak to the VP. After 3-4 emails to Brian I emailed the VP Mario. I emailed him twice about the situation  at Arrowhead location. I explained my situation in detail. I NEVER got any response from either email. I also called VP Mario on 2 separate occasions, left a voice mail. Again NO response or call. I then called and asked to speak to the owner or president. I was told I could not have their emails. They told me Mario was the one to talk to about complaints or concerns. I explained that Mario had chosen to ignore all 4 of my attempts to contact him. I got one phone message from Mario and told him when I could be reached...no attempt was made on his part to reach me again. 

This is the final ( and 3rd) email I sent. I have NEVER gotten any response. 

WHAT A DISGRACEFUL COMPANY. Taking money for services not rendered, not responding to a member's concerns. I KNOW I am not the only one who has encountered this. 

SHAME ON YOU MOUNTAINSIDE FITNESS!!!!

October 4, 2017
Mario - 

I am sorry I missed your call Monday afternoon at 3:45 p.m. I was in a meeting. I e-mailed you that I would be available after 4:15 p.m. I did not hear from you either via e-mail or phone. I also did not hear from you the next day to follow-up.

To say that I am frustrated is an understatement. I have been trying to deal with and get resolution to my issues since August 14.  I e-mailed back and forth with Brian with no results or true actions. On August 28 I decided to deal with you with the expectation that the VP would certainly be more concerned about his clientele and be professional in his actions and response times. 

I e-mailed you on August 28 and then about 5-7 days later. I received no acknowledgement that you had even read or received my e-mails and my concerns. I then called you on September 18 and left voicemail for you. I again called and left a voicemail for you on September 25. Again there was no response. 

So now it is 4 weeks since my communication efforts with you have started and 6 weeks since this entire situation started. 

I have asked to be refunded for my remaining 93 sessions and have just been told I could be provided another trainer. Brian said if I could not make my appointments he would have some resolution for me. ( That was the e-mail from late August ).

Personal training, by nature, requires personal attention. The health and fitness industry is a service based industry. Clients need to feel they are valued, respected and have a positive and encouraging relationship with the trainer and the other gym personnel.  Sadly this appears not to be the case or priority with Mountainside Fitness. 

How have your actions and your team members accomplished this? They haven't and you haven't. I feel like my concerns and my issues are being swept under the rug in hopes of it just going away. To have this as the culture in your managers and this company is so sad. 

This very poorly handled situation has fractured our client relationship beyond repair. There has been no respect, no efforts, and definitely no customer service. 

I can't truly believe that under these circumstances you will not honor my request. Would you really ask that I continue to work out in such a negative environment? Are you really going to keep the money for the services you could no longer provide me in a suitable manner? 

I simply want final resolution to this manner in the form of the refund for the 93 sessions. It has been 6 weeks with no efforts on the part of this company.  Refunding the sessions will take very little effort on your part.  If this cannot be resolved in accordance with what I am asking then I will have to pursue more formal  avenues of resolution that will bring public awareness of the poor overall culture at this company. 

Sincerely,
Leigh Ann Stastny
AMAZING!! The food is just great. I didn't know about this place until some of my coworkers had them. I live in North Las Vegas and I never heard of this place.  Their "The Cobra" is to die for!!!! They are in an odd location, but well worth it!!!

YOU MUST GO NOW!!!!
Hannys is SUCH a great bar for so many reasons. It's an old men's department store-and I can only imagine what is was like back in the day... it has a very classy and trendy atmosphere. There are some creepy things that you should seek out while you are there... go downstairs and checkout the old glass floor elevator... oh and good luck getting lost finding the bathroom... (you'll be okay with being lost). The food is great! Salads are huuuuge portions. The prosciutto pizza is my absolute favorite! The snack plate is great, and the onion strings are also a huge portion that can be shared by a table. Love all the drinks I've had here as well... champagne Bellini and French 75 are my favs :):) they serve food til 1, drinks til 1:30 and  at midnight they serve delish lil martinis..!!
We stopped in on our walk from Cosmo to NY NY for the Cirque show. awesome draft list for Vegas, the food didnt blow me away but it wasnt bad either and since I was there for the beer anyway its just an added bonus. I will def be hittin this place up next time Im back
Store and gas station itself are fine but OMG panhandlers outside were very aggressive and I did not feel safe.  Complained to person inside and he kind of just shrugged his shoulders and basically said it is what it is.  I understand he is just a minimum wage guy trying to get through the day but I would at least expect someone higher up here to try to regulate things.  Out of control.
We stopped in here for a quick meal. We had somewhere we needed to be so we sat at the bar. Our bartender was friendly and took our order fairly quickly. He was attentive and helpful.

To help speed the process along I ordered a pepperoni pizza. It came out quickly. The pizza was larger than I expected. It had a thin, crisp crust. I enjoyed it. I would have likely enjoyed it even more if I had more time to eat it at a normal pace. The pizza was a decent price for Las Vegas.

At some point I will have to come by and try real meal at a table so I can give a more helpful review.
We ordered the steak pizza without green peppers. They may seem a little pricey, but the quality is very good and they give you a lot of toppings. The pizza was not greasy at all and it had a very good flavor. Simple and not overpowering. I could've probably ate the whole large pie!
So happy we came into this place!! We live right around the corner and have never been before... Boy what a mistake!! This will be our new spot for sure!! Service was great. Rocia was so sweet!!! Good was amazing everything we order was perfect!! Can't wait to come back!
Okay, I am a Marriott fan, and used to great Marriott service. Meeting the family in Scottsdale for Thanksgiving, 6 of us, so we had 2 two bedroom suites. Solid hotel, not the Ritz, but perfect for the six of us. Great Marriott service, clean and efficient and quite reasonable with breakfast and coffee throughout the day included. In a nice convenient area of Scottsdale, many attractions and dining choices close by. As always, besides cleanliness, superior customer service and pleasant staff such as Kim and all at the front desk were great representatives of superb customer service, kudos to the breakfast staff and housekeeping staff, top notch even giving up their own Thanksgiving to take care of the guests.  Marriott is a solid brand, and this economical choice of the brand does not disappoint, will be back!
Came highly recommended by a friend for dinner. Lots of Indian mainstays on the menu. Very impressive selection of Naan. I, for one, had the garlic variety which was excellent with my lamb masala.  The place was immaculate in terms of cleanliness, and we came in after the typical dinner rush. Waitstaff were very friendly and accommodating. Will be returning soon.
Abridged: Aside from the inconsistency with deals and pricing, it's a great wax. Worth the trip.

Unabridged: European Wax Center was recommended to me by my new stylist when I ended up falling in love with a hair salon that didn't do waxing. I have to admit that when I entered the location for the first time, I thought I was signing up for a cult. Just gave me one of those odd feelings. 

That ended when I went back though and had my eyebrows waxed. It was the least painful waxing I've ever had. The room was clean, my waxer was nice and friendly. She made sure I wasn't allergic to anything. It was very pleasant and the price is super reasonable. 

After my first visit, I was told about a plan I could sign up for. I declined, but was told if I booked my next appointment in advance now, I'd get $5 off. What I wasn't told, was that there was a piece of paper or something I needed to have in order to redeem that, and when I returned a few weeks later, I wasn't given my discount. I was assured I will next time, but we'll see what happens. If the third time proves to have no discount attached, it may be enough for me to leave. I want to come back, but I also don't like being toyed with.
I've been to the Rose and Crown a handful of times, usually after improv events, as it seems to be the go to place. Never have I sat inside, which is always an indicator to me that a place is worthy of repeat visits. Patios are in... indoors are out!

The selection is typical pub, and always has something I want, but I do always get sad face when a place doesn't carry ginger ale. Ginger ale is not only easy to make (and no, I'm not referring to the fake make it with coke way.. WTF is that?) but a fantastic mixer with all types of alcohol. 

If you want a good place to socialize that's kinda crazy but not too crazy, this is a great choice!
For 10 years we have been going to Dr.Winston for all of our pets. Fortunately for the past 4 years we haven't had to see him, but in the past month we have had a couple of visits. 
Dr Winston is the most caring and gracious man and doctor. He truly cares about each animal and the owners. He has gone out of his way for us, seeing our fur baby on the weekend..no charge by the way... and does whatever it takes to make each animal and owner happy. I can't say enough about this man!
I wouldnt go anywhere else!!!
New favorite date night spot: classy & fresh quality sushi, sashimi & nigiri! 

My hubs and I have been here twice and really enjoyed the cocktails: Thai Heat martini was my favorite but I tried the pear martini which was well balanced.

Summary:
The baked lobster roll- rich & creamy
Yellowtail- fresh
Dragon roll- gorgeous & yummy
Freshwater eel: amazing
Sea eel: ok

We sat inside the first time and patio the second- which I prefer indoors due to the random families & people passing by staring at your food. Love the weather through!  Maybe next time well try sitting in the bar area.

The service is very consistent!  Both gals who took care of us were polite, helpful, well timed, and accurate.
Carbonara's is a wonderful family restaurant. Located on mt Lebanon Blvd, they serve many classic Italian dishes, toasted subs (ahhhhmazing), salads, soups,etc. every time we go here the service is prompt, friendly, and personable. They are always busy with takeout and In house orders. Their pizza is delicious for a quick pick up! They have a full bar and tons of parking.
I've been going to Great Clips for years.  I've always left very happy.  I highly recommend Lavern!
Did someone say sushi?!  Oh wait, that's my daily craving!  It was New Year Day and guess what I wanted to have for dinner to ring in the Mew Year?  you guessed it, sushi!

Originally, I was going to go to another sushi joint which I will not name here cause I don't want to start a sushi rivalry but the other joint was closed on New Year Day. 

As it turns out, it was a blessing in disguise since Squid Ink is located right next to the ice skating rink so we were able to have dinner then walk right over to go skating- so convenient!

We had quite a feast.  Chicken teriyaki bowl for my son, chicken teriyaki noodle for his friend, edamame, shisito peppers, 3 California rolls, 1 spicy Salmon roll, miso cod.  Oh, did you think the rolls were for me?  

Of course not!  My growing boy ate his chicken teriyaki bowl then proceeded to eat the California rolls and the spicy salmon roll. After some gentle reminders, I did get a few pieces from each of the different rolls. 

It's a good thing when my son heartily eats (since for a young'n, he has a pretty good palate) and we are fighting,hmm I mean sharing happily our sushi!

Michele M. who also joined us for dinner ordered gyoza, fried tofu, California roll, fried shrimp tempura roll also enjoyed her selections. 

My fav out of them all was the miso cod. 4 thin slices, perfectly cooked so the cod was still tender and moist. Hmmm, just thinking about it makes me what to have it again.

Service is amicable. Staff friendly. Glad to have come here- and will come again!
Purchasing my new Infiniti has been such a pleasant experience! Steven and Lon were amazing with helping me learn everything I needed to know about my new Q50. They truly went over and beyond my expectations. I would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a new vehicle.
canes sauce is what this place is all about! there chicken all ways comes out hot and fresh. there was one better chicken place called rock n roll chicken fingers in tempe but there gone now, so this is the best chicken fingers in the valley right now for sure.
Oh man... Black Dog... I wish you were closer!! Though I'm considering driving down to Champaign just to indulge in your tasty 'que and brews! Just thinking about you is making my mouth water!

This is a great joint in your are looking for some solid BBQ   They also have a nice selection of microbrews. Get ready to wait though... We went at 3pm on Saturday and we still waited for a solid 20 minutes! Though the wait during peak lunch and dinner hours is way worse... It's almost painful watching plates of mouthwatering meats pass by you while you stand there helplessly. But trust me, the wait is worth it!
Alright. . . ticking off the list:

1)  Nice atmosphere
2)  Good service
3)  meh food

It's new, and pretty, and while it's a "diner", it's a diner that was built in the last three months, so the decor is pretty sweet, everything is all clean and gleaming brushed stainless and muted colors.  No patina of cigarette smoke and coffee stains, like the tried and true diners of old.  Which is a good thing.

The service was good, I don't recall her being particularly knowledgeable, but how knowledgeable could she have been since we ate there two weeks after they opened?  I also don't remember her being NOT knowledgeable.  So. . . YAY!

Now for the bad. . . 

I ordered a reuben.  My friend remarked that it's hard to find a place that has a good reuben.  I didn't necessarily agree, but said nothing.  We both got it.  We were both surprised to see it served open face, which, upon asking the manager (we'll come back to him in a minute) was because, "It's the chef's interpretation of a reuben.  He wanted to make it unique."  

It WAS unique.  But unique in a way that sucked.  Like if the chef interpreted a hot dog by saying, "HERE we serve our hot dogs with the mustard in your hand instead of on the dog. "  It was a stupid interpretation.  Messy.  And not good.  Because the sauerkraut was kind of slippery, and the cheese was kind of melty, and the dressing was very heavy handed, so when you used your knife to cut it you ended up with half the sandwich still on the plate because it wouldn't stick on the fork, so you had a bite of cheese and dressing, then went back for a bite of bread and saurkraut and meat.  It was sloppy and I ended up scooping most of the dressing onto the side of the plate so it was tolerable.  And on the plus side there was a lot of food. . . but the negative of that was it was really hard to cut without food dropping off the side of the plate while you sawed at the sandwich through the meat.  

So then the manager came to our table, which I generally liked, but he was so aggressively wanting to nip any issues in the bud that he came across a little. . . militantly servile.  "Did everything exceed your expectations?" he asked.  Then when our grunts of polite assent didn't suffice, he addressed each of us individually. . . it was uncomfortable.  I just wanted to be left to eat my shitty sandwich in peace.  I felt uncomfortable complaining about my shitty sandwich, because it was, of course, ON PURPOSE.  Did it exceed my expectations?  No!  But I didn't really want to interrupt my meal to have a discussion about it.  I bought his departure by saying that I didn't really have any expectations coming in, so I couldn't really judge whether they'd been exceeded.  Which was a lie.

When we paid our bill. . . the manager was at the cash register. . . eagerly waiting to ask, once more, "Did your experience exceed your expectations?"  UGGGGHHHH!  I just wanted to leave.  "I don't know, yes. . . yes, it was fine!"  

Ultimately, I will return.  It was really close to work, and it's my own fault for not reading that they serve the reuben open faced.  I assume it's on the menu that way.  And next time I'll just tell the manager to go away because he's bothering me, which is more my speed. . . I was just caught a little off guard.

If my next experience is. . . better (which will exceed my expectations) I'll update my review and add a star or two to it.  Until then though. . . it was "meh".  Diner food.
The worst "Mexican" food I've had, sadly.  It's also the most Caucasian (not counting the likes of Taco Bell).  The second worst was Del Taco, which had a far uglier interior and was in a worse neighborhood, but at least that was edible.

The enchiladas have a massive (ridiculously massive!) amount of white onion inside them, which I hated.  Their red sauce is not flavorful.  Their cheese is very low quality, and greasy too, while the tortillas aren't really anything of note.

This is on my "won't ever go there again" list, sadly.  For fast Mexican food just go to Los Favoritos by Bashas' down the street, or run into the mall food court for Rubio's.
I came to Sedona Lounge based on some local knowledge, and it turned out to be a great meal!  It's slightly off-Strip and located in Summerlin, but a quick drive on the 215 will get you there in no time.  It's slightly dim on the inside, but it feels much nicer and more upscale than the menu prices would indicate.  Supposedly Andre Agassi eats here from time to time.

Mrs. C continued her string of unbelievable ordering.  She got the cheapest dish, but it was also the best.  How does she do it??  The 3-course menu for about $30 consisted of:
- chicken consomme, brought out in a fancy teapot and then poured into a small bowl of mushrooms tableside
-seared scallops with a bacon and mushroom cream sauce
-creme brulee
There are other 3-course menu choices, but that's how she rolls in Vegas.

I got the NY Strip, and college classmate's mom, (who now lives in Vegas and whose suggestion it was to try Sedona Lounge) got the fillet mignon.  Here's the scoop, tho - on Sunday evenings, the steak menu is 50% off!  We got a great deal on a dinner that night!  I would have liked it if i could have ordered a baked potato with my steak instead of the small roasted ones, but that's a minor complaint when you consider the quality of the food being served.  A great deal, but made even better on Sundays!
Unlike it's neighboring store, this place actually has cute vintage stuff and AC! I liked the fact that "I Love Lucy" was playing on old TV's and set up just like a living room from 1950. There were also 2 adorable bathrooms with kitchy stuff inside to buy. I also liked the snack table, which included free popcorn, candy and cookies. How clever! I didn't end up buying anything here but really liked it. Just be careful walking around...very tight spaces and stuff everywhere! I would probably return.
I've used this place many times. I've gone in a few times for coffee or some other small item, but usually I get gas here and rarely need to go inside.

I've never had a problem and will continue to use this place.
Had the most amazing massage today by Laura. Unfortunately I don't live in the area, but if I did, I would be back regularly!! She gave a wonderful massage, the perfect blend between deep tissue work and truly therapeutic relaxation techniques. She was attentive and incredibly professional. 

I had been searching for a spa\/massage salon for my boyfriend and I and randomly found this one. I was pleasantly surprised by the spa-like ambiance - soothing spa music, aromatherapy, dim lighting, calming aesthetics... this was such a gem of a find!

I cannot praise Laura enough! Book with her!!
I love this place. The hummus is great, the people are great. The lamb pies are absolutely incredible. This place will teach you anything you want to know about middle eastern food! A good friend of mine is Egyptian and moved here a few years ago and this place is the closest he said he's come to home. Have to respect that!
Location, location, location is the strength of this eatery! Views of the lake, a great outdoor bar and lots of parking for your truck or your yacht. Friday night the restaurant was slow and we were seated promptly. A very engaging hostess as well as the wait staff. 

The menu offers a variety of items mostly fried choices. Eating lite, I ordered a small bowl of chili and a quesadilla. The chili was served luke warm, mild\/bland flavor and beanless, as advertised. The quesadilla was soggy. Other guests ordered a fried chicken sandwiches which were "ok", ribs "to die for" and a salad which looked wilted. 

One of our guests was looking for a specific item which was missing from the menu. The waiter said the item had been dropped. The manager was quick to followup with an explanation "Chef is upgrading the menu" and the item was no longer available. Made the guest feel appreciated other than a flat "no got"!

Our friends live near by and say this is one of the better places to eat in the area and there's the lake. Once the sun sets T-Bones is just a red neck bar( no offense intended) with a great view of the lake and below average food.  If you've been on the lake all day, in a swim suit and tee shirt this may be the perfect choice. By the way.....they do have live music on weekends!

PS: the ever present armed Sheriff Department officer patrolling the inside of the restaurant\/bar gave one a nice secure feeling!
I had passed this place many times and was always interested, so we stopped in for dinner one Friday night.  It was very average.  The salad was really small and mostly just wet lettuce, the bread tasted store-bought, and the meals lacked great flavor.  It was quick, our service was fine, and the price was reasonable.  I have no reason to go back, though.
David and Corey were incredibly friendly and gave my wife and I the price we were looking for. Although car buying is a process, they made the process very simple and easy. Jim from finance was also top notch.  He made the contract signing a breeze. I would recommend automation Honda to all of my friends and family. We'll be back in 3 years.
I have never been to a pumpkin patch, so we decided to go to one this year! We went on a Friday (and I wish we would have come on Saturday or Sunday!) 
We didn't know exactly what to do or where to go, so we asked the lady sitting at the register. She was super sweet and explained everything! 
We grabbed a wagon and headed off to find our pumpkin! We ended up getting two smaller sized ones, and a medium size (we live in a townhome so we don't have much walkway space). We checked out the farm animals as well. They had some chickens, little horses, goats, pigs, sheep, and I think regular sized horses. On the weekends they sell food and holiday beverages (cider and hot chocolate) as well as do hay rides!
When you pay they have a sizing chart, and you pay what you think you should pay. You just tell her how much and she swipes your card! Easy as pumpkin pie. 
Overall this place is great for younger kids (as it is a large piece of land and they will get tired by the time the leave!) and it was a great first experience.
Came here last night. Service was great and the food was just as good. They have a full bar but also have a wine selection as well. I had the buffalo chicken flatbread which was really good and different for me. This place is pretty new so it looks great inside and has a nice ambiance too. This is a place where you can come and hangout with the homies and watch a game or take someone out for a low key date for good food and conversation. There's plenty of different types of seat selections too.

They also had live jazz music last night, where local musician Harvey Cummings and his band did a great job mixing traditional jazz music with a little bit of RnB and neo soul. 

Overall, had a great time and I'll definitely be back.
I've visited the store in NY and realized I didn't get to try their hot chocolate.  After a disappointing lunch at Trevi, we walked to Max Brenner's for some dessert and opted for their famous hot chocolate (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=MuutN42Qrw60UIsoR86PsQ).  A thick and rich hot chocolate it was good but a bit too sweet for me.  I only had maybe 1\/4 of the cup and already felt jittery from the sugar high.  I also sampled some of their chocolate pecans which was very good, also adding to my sugar high.  A disappointing thing was that I was unable to pick my assortment of chocolates as I had done so in NY.  Apparently they closed this section down since it was holiday season.
Yummy spot. I like that it's downtown Tempe and a nice sit down restaurant with a more restaurant vibe than a bar vibe. It's located right off Mill so be prepared to pay for parking. Outdoor seating is available for people watching. Nice place for families. High chairs weren't filthy like some places. 

This was my second time coming here and I liked the food. Tried the chef's soup special which was a creamy crab bisque with corn and it had the perfect amount of spice to it. Ordered the bowl so I'll have left overs for lunch tomorrow :) Mushroom enchiladas are so yummy - not something I'd normally order but my husband had them last time and after trying his I've been craving them ever since - which is a large reason why I wanted to come back today :) Enchiladas come with rice and beans and a mango salsa. They also served us a corn bread in a cast iron skillet - on the house - with our soup. I didn't care for it too much but my husband liked it. 

Service was good as waiter was quite attentive. Pleasantly surprised with the quality of food and service. It wasn't very busy at all but I believe both times I came on weekday evenings. Will definitely come back :)
Dr. Pierce has been my doctor for many years, he and his staff are always very helpful, knowledgeable, and a pleasure to work with. I am very comfortable in the care of Ageless Forever!
We are regulars for over 3 years, once a week we would come here and eat sushi. The service has declined a lot. We were just there a couple weeks ago and we had terrible service. We were the only people there, they had two waitresses and one sushi chef. Took forever to get refills and our check. I had to seek out the waitress to get our check, only to find her chit chatting with a fellow co-worker. I waited a bit before I had to stop her mid-sentence to ask for our check.

Plus side, the sushi is fantastic, delicious and fresh. The staff are friendly and the waitress is nice, she remembered us every time we came in.

Deal breaker-Service! You can only deal so much with bad service. Especially, when we were the only people in the restaurant, there is no reason for such terrible service. We have given this place multiple chances hoping the service would change.
We just took a hospital tour here because my wife and I are planning on delivering our baby there. I'm not too familiar with hospitals but I think it's really cool that they even offer a tour so that you can familiarize yourself with the whole process. They also offer a ton of parental classes which we plan on taking. And I love how they have it set up to where your baby never leaves your sight after delivery.
This place is disgusting. Rude staff that never smiles or greets their customers. They just stand around and look lost! Food does not look fresh. Dining area is now well kept. Today they looked at me like I was crazy because I needed my receipt. Not my problem your credit card machine was out of paper. Suggestion try being more organized. Also, try limiting the number of customers that smell like weed. I nearly left this afternoon from contact buzz. Never going back, I'd take my chances with the "all you can eat" pancakes at the biker bar down the street.
Good place to grab a quick bite. Wanted to see if the hype was indeed real. Service wasn't slow. Had myself The Earl's Club. The sandwich is indeed spectacular. A tad pricey, but it's better than a subway sandwich.  I would say the sandwich was like 8 inches.  Would definitely come back and try the other offerings.
I sort of want to give this place 3-1\/2 stars, but oh well. 

This weird little nook, way down on Sheppard, is barely noticeable if you drive by. I've gotten their take out a few times and also eaten in once. 

I've had their chicken shwarma and falafel pitas and sampled some other dishes. Generally, I find the portions quite large and the food quite good, but it's a bit of a crap shoot with the chicken shwarma. I've had it a couple of times where it has been very good and another time I thought the meat was chewy, fatty and full of gristle. It's being cut off of a big hunk on a spit, so I guess you get whatever comes off at that time. 

The service has always been great and very pleasant.
Visited from Cali with a basketball team and loved this place.  The place was clean and well decorated.  When we walked in the customer service was professional and friendly.  They greeted us right away and offered to put tables together for us. Awesome customer service. And we've received great customer service from Arizonians during our stay.   

I order the 2 meat with brisket and ribs.   The sides were corn bread and mac and cheese.   I've tried the potato salad as well.   As we were enjoying, the gentleman handed out samples of turkey. My husband also had to chopped chicken and i stole a piece of hot link from one of the players plates when he went to get a drink.   

Everything was so good!!!  The brisket was perfectly done. It was moist and flavorful.  I hate overcooked brisket.   The ribs were delicious.   They were not over seasoned or over sauced.   You can appreciate the meat.   The mac and cheese, well all the kids loved it. The pot salad was good too. Not too much dressing.   The chicken was also moist and full of flavor. My picky son loved it.  The turkey samples made me regret not ordering it. It was so good.   I should've ordered it.

My recommendation is the brisket.   I couldn't get enough of it. When my non meat eater daughter likes it, then it's good.   One thing would have liked to see is the corn bread having a crust on top.   That sweet crust would have really been nice and maybe serve with butter. 

There are a lot of pics of the food already posted.   But pics don't do it justice.  Go there. Smell the aroma.  Eat the food. Leave happy.   I posted pics of the team enjoying the food.
Greeted in the parking lot by Gianfranco! I kid you not. Never been to the place before but made to feel as if I was family. Ordered the Branzino (one of several unreal daily specials) and it was probably the best Branzino I have had off the Adriatic. Tried several of the other dishes that were just as good. Service is some of the best I have experienced. Very knowledgeable and not pushy. Waiter suggested excellent Italian wine from Montepulciano that was actually very reasonably priced. Will return and definitely recommend.
The girl at the counter was friendly and she got our order right. 
The place is clean but dated. Which seems to be changing as they have signs up warning about some contruction work.
I have gone to this location many times as it is super close toy home. I have never had the experience the last reviewer had. 
This is a food chain I feel bad for as they never seem to be very busy. But the food is different and good. Not just a McDonald's clone
Fancy thai bar. Great food for quick lunches. Ambience. Dim. Fast and friendly service. Young professional central, everyone in their suits.
They have a large pizza special. Call them, but be patient on the phone, they can be kinda rude. Walking in is another option if you're around the campus. Quality is what you expect from a mom-pop pizza, "good enough". Open very late. Iconic.

Roomier dining area than Cora's.
Marilyn is the bomb!! HTC in Tempe was my former go to place and I'm so excited there's now an Uptown location too. I was getting a little tired of my industrial, and when it fell out recently, I used it as a perfect excuse to go in and get something else done. Marilyn helped me decide an anti-tragus would be perfect. And it is. It healed perfectly and I was recently able to go in and size it down a bit, at which point a photo was taken for their gallery.

There's usually only one staff member working at a time here, so there can be a line, but I think it's well worth it. It's clean, the staff is awesome and friendly and it's right by some amazing shops if you want to wander a bit on those crowded days.
A girl friend and I headed here before our trip to shop for a wedding dress - I needed the half bottle of wine we ordered!  Was there a happy hour menu?  Happy hour prices?  We didn't ask, but didn't see anything advertised either.

We shared the plate of cheeses, bread, fruit, etc., and it was pretty tasty.  Loved the dried figs.  We also each ordered the greek (Uro? Oro?) salad, and agreed on the deliciousness of it.  I would definitely order that again.  

Service was a little on the slow side, but we were chatting so much that it was no biggie.  I would love to return and try a few more menu items!
Trekked here for lunch one day with some work folk. It left an eh in my mind. Not a bad eh, which is usually a 2 for me, but more like an I'll-come-back-here-if-someone-else-is-dying-to eh, which leaves it at a 3.

I can say that the cornbread is exquisite. It's what cornbread should be. Corn and bread. It's not cornmeal trying to be cornbread. It's not some yuppie metropolitan height of sophistication's chef trying to be country. It's the no shit real deal. I appreciate that. I just have to remember to appreciate it in small quantities.

The service was pretty on par for it being lunch on a Monday. 

My main dish was the seafood enchilada which was pretty on point, but not as good as the one at Blue Adobe. I was pretty annoyed to see it came with tomato even though tomato was listed nowhere on the menu. I will remember that. I may just return and order cornbread with a side of cornbread.
The subs are good, the bread is fresh, and they deliver late.  This is a great combination in my book!  The prices are good and they have a lot of different kinds of subs.  They do lack in side dishes.
I've passed SideBar on several occasions but entered the establishment with a group of about 10 for the first time last night as the 2nd half of the last part of my birthday festivities. I walked out happy, which means it was a success. 

The highlights? Plenty.

I made new friends. And hey, who doesn't like new partners in crime?

The decor was a great compliment to the night of sexy pretentiousness that preceded it. The couches were fairly comfortable. I loved the exposed brick, the low lighting, the fixtures, the movies, and the music. Speaking of music, songs from the Fugees album The Score were on frequently throughout the night making me want to listen to the whole album so badly that when I got back to my car I spent 10 minutes digging through my glove box to find my copy. I'm still listening to it today.

The service was pretty damn skippy from what I saw. I never had to get up to get my own drink thanks to my amazing friends, but I always seemed to get them quickly. 

The drinks I had were very well made. On the suggestion of the bartender I tried a White Rabbit and also had a lemon drop shot. I usually am put off by chocolate based drinks as I'm not a huge chocolate fan and they always taste fake, but the White Rabbit delivered. I could drink it in a gallon pitcher. With a big bendy straw. And an umbrella. The lemon drop was the best I've had. 

What do I wish was better?

I'd love to see Frambroise *and* Guinness on tap so I could have a red velvet made (my favorite beverage). The up side was I got a can of Guinness and a bottle of Frambroise and was able to make 2 of my own which also meant I could use the proportions i like (30% Frambroise, 70% Guinness).

After my workout earlier in the day the stairs were hell. However, that anger went away quickly.
I'm visiting from Florida so I'm trying to hit all the vegan spots while I'm here. Am I ever glad I stopped into Urban Herbivore. Great menu. As soon you walk in the door the wonderful aromas permeate your nostrils. I ordered the Moroccan Stew with grilled seitian. It was absolutely to die for. I was completely stuffed. I'll be going back for sure.
The hostess was exceptionally helpful.  Due to traffic, I was 45 minutes late for my reservation, but they worked to accommodate us.  Customer service there is exceptional.

The waiter was attentive and friendly, but did seem very busy.

The restaurant is crowded and you sit quite close to your neighbors, but its tolerable.

The appetizer came out very quickly.  We got the Spinach Artichoke Dip with Pita Chips.  It was tasty.  The entrees took a little longer to come out.  I had the Cedar Planked Salmon with Fingerling Potatoes.  It was also tasty.  My date got the Pasta Marina with Mushrooms.  Lots of mushrooms.  After tasting her dish, I commented that I could probably make that same thing at home but better tasting.  

We each had two cocktails.  She had sangria and I had vodka "iced tea".  I didn't care for her drink.  It was overly sweet and syrupy.  However, I did like my Raspberry Vodka "Iced Teas" that were garnished with a blackberry and a lime.  I didn't even feel like drinking, but I am glad I ordered those.

The menu all fits on one page, but has a lot of variety and caters well to individuals with dietary restrictions.  We were impressed with the selection.

However, the total bill was $90.  In my opinion, the food and the drinks were over-priced.  For a restaurant of its class located on East 4th Street, perhaps it is appropriately priced, but don't expect amazing food.  Expect food that tastes good, nothing more.
Typical McDonalds. Food was typical. Employees were typical. Wait time was typical. Clientele was typical. Typical.
Worst customer service I have ever received in my life.

I bought a nonrefundable online coupon for 3 of their LipoLaser treatments. The front desk lady, Debbie, was beyond nasty to me every time we spoke. I decided I'd rather lose out on the money than ever step foot in that place again. 

When I called to set up the consultation, it was about 6 weeks before the expiration date. I tried asking Debbie if I would have enough time to get all the treatments in if I waited a week because of my work schedule. ( I knew nothing about the LipoLaser stuff, like how long to wait between appts.)  She retorted snottily with how she doesn't know my schedule and that can't tell me when to make my appointment. So rude!!

Regardless, I made an appointment for the consultation for the following week. Upon arriving there was no one at the front desk or in the waiting room.  I stood at the front desk for about 3 mins before Dr. Gallagher greeted me and told me to have a seat and "Debbie knew I was coming and should be right back."  I waited for over 10 minutes wondering why I wasn't filling out paperwork or something proactive. Debbie never showed.  The Doc came back out and gave me some forms to fill out.  I did that. Then waited another 8 mins or so. It finally became apparent that Debbie was not coming back so the Doc gave me a brief tour. He was friendly enough, the consultation seemed pointless and definitely unorganized.  The "tour" took about 5 mins.  I made an appt. for my first session the following week. 

I gave myself 30 mins to get there for what would be normally a 15 drive.  However, it happened to be the crazy fluke day that it started snowing in Scottsdale. Traffic was significantly worse than normal.  Five mins before my appt. time I called Touch of Health, trying to be considerate and explain that because of the random insane weather I may be a few mins late.  Debbie answered. I explained that I've been sitting on the 101 for 20 mins and could be a few mins a late.  She snapped at me and said "Well, I'm sitting here waiting on you!"  I was flabbergasted and appalled. I wasn't even late yet, and I was being scolded by a receptionist?! I couldn't even handle the rudeness anymore. So I responded with "Well, funny. I was waiting on you for my consultation..." She cut me off and got super defensive with how "No, no. You're weren't waiting on me. The Doctor helped you!"  I realized it was pointless to argue with this awful receptionist, yet I was enraged at this moment. I told her I certainly wasn't planning on traffic being awful and the situation. "We'll if you're more than 15 mins late you'll have to reschedule.'' I decided to just forget it at this point, and told her I wanted to reschedule. I had no desire to be yelled at further by this lady with a severe attitude problem.  Instead of rescheduling me then, she told me to call back tomorrow. 

I did not call back.  What a terrible experience from beginning to end.  The coupon I  bought was not cheap but I refuse to have any interaction with Debbie again.  She made me feel unappreciated and just plan awful with her nasty tone and nasty words. I don't know if I received such awful treatment because I was using the coupon, but I should've been treated with the same respect as everybody else.  I don't know how the place would still be open if Debbie treats all patients\/customers in such a rude despicable manner. 

I wish I could leave no stars!
RUDE RUDE RUDE!!!

Oh did I mention these are the rudest people I have ever encountered! Even rude by LV standards.  Don't support these people.

Came here after a day of wild flower hunting in the Superstitions- it was a Wed. so all of us ordered the baby back bbq rib special.  Not especially memorable.  What I did like was the cole slaw made from purple cabbage and vinegar with some black pepper.  No mayo, extremely light, healthy and delicious.  The cole slaw was the saving grace.  This place was so unmemorable to me that I forgot the name of the restaurant and had to do a search for bbq in Chandler.  When I can't remember the name of a restaurant, that tells it all
$6.  Three huge tacos.  

One was pulled chicken which was noting to write home about.  I topped it with one of the really spicy sauces which had my nose running.  The sauce was awesome.  

One was pulled pork.  Wow.  To die for.  So good.  I topped that with a milder sauce (I can't remember which one).  The pork was tender and cooked to perfection.  Plus the corn tortillas.  So fresh.  Squeezed some lime on top.  Fantastic.

One was chorizo.  It was a little heavier than I would have preferred (i.e., greasy) but I guess I kind-of asked for it.  I topped that with the avocado sauce.  It helped cool the spicy chorizo (and my still burning mouth).  Added more lime.  I would like to buy a chorizo and make it with eggs the next morning.

Friendly staff.  Quick service--they fry the tortillas right in front of you.  The corn tortillas are awesome too. You dress your tacos yourself.
I went here for the first time the other day and I loved it! I loved the ease of ordering. I love the cool soda machine and I love the atmosphere. It feels like a real burger joint to me. 

I will be going here again. I do agree with some of these yelp reviews, it is a little pricey.
Hipster-y, just like everything else in this area. Captain Jerk and the Atomic Burger are certified goodness. The cheese in the Atomic Burger was something I craved for days after. Fries were fresh and the dips were good. Plenty of seatings for dine ins.
I loved the Wynn!!! It was worth the splurge. The whole hotel is great, and the rooms were very nice. The rooms have the same amenities for a suite. Lots of shops and a good buffet for brunch.
My wife and I love Sprouts and now we have one within 10 minutes of us. We went today for the grand opening and everyone was so friendly. It's beautiful inside and if you're looking for a healthier lifestyle, GO TO SPROUTS!
Start with the the good news, my breakfast burrito was made with fresh ingredients and was very tasty. The server(s) were friendly, knowledgeable and attentive keeping the coffee and water full. Unfortunately, a fellow diner was served  home fries swimming in grease! When asked for a separate dish to remove the fries from the grease she assisted with the rescue mission and added "that's just not right". What would have been right would be replace the breakfast. The place was empty and will stay that way if they continue to serve substandard quality food at the upper end of the pricing scale. I've visited a sister location and have found quality food with very high prices. No value here today!
You have to try to deep fried mushrooms. They are so good when dipped in ranch. The atmosphere in this place is friendly and fun. And the menus build to custom order. So if you have someone in your life that simply cannot order straight off the menu they would like this dinner
Good for quick snacks, chicken on the rocks is pretty good. They smothered the chicken with garlic sauce, deliciouso. The portions are also generous though I can't really tell the difference between the large and the medium.
I thought I would stop by here after leaving the Baguette Cafe, just so I could scratch it off my list. It was just down the street so we grabbed a couple of juices.

The store was clean, but some of the table tops could have used a wipe down. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Unfortunately it is just another over priced juice bar to me. $18 for two juices that were not even juiced to order. They were juiced early that morning, so I was told. The juice was good, but if I am paying $9 per drink, I would like to see the ingredients be fed into the juicer.

We tried the 24 Carrot and the Apple Spice. The Apple Spice had apples, ginger, and lemon. The 24 carrot was apples, carrots, and ginger.

Both drinks were good, but I am giving three stars because they don't juice your drinks to order.
Date & Time: at least once a week

Expect nothing but great service, I would say around dinner time the price for two people is about $60, they offer stamp cards if you are frequent customer.

I been going to this place since it opened back in 2008ish. This is my go to place when it comes to sushi. They are super friendly and super fast service, I can't complain.

Favorite Rolls:
-Salmon loves lemon
-Spiderman
-Angry Ninja
-& most of the nigiri :)
Beautifully authentic classy mexican food vegas style!! My girl friend and I felt right at home with Eduardo and his lovely team mates.

Chips and salsa arrive quickly as we decide on a casa margarita and jalapeño margarita.  Fancy handshaken margaritas for the win. I also try the Mexican margarita which is with fresh lime only which I prefer to the jalapeño margarita.

My shrimp Javier's chopped salad was yummy!! They managed not to overcook the shrimp.  My friend loves her crispy taco and enchilada combo.

Wish we could come back soon!! Aria has a great variety of spots.  This restaurant was happening and we really appreciated the lovely service and spacious booth for 2 female diners.
Not a fan of the citrus that they put in with their flan and cakes.

My custard bun was pretty lackluster.  It had a strange aftertaste I couldn't figure out and was not very eggy or vanilla-infused.  It had very little filling.  It could not hold up to other custard buns sold at Lee Lee or Asahi Bakery.

They would sell a lot more bread if they bought a slicer.  The cashier said many people ask them to slice the bread and I am positive they would sell more loaves.

The $6 minimum charge to use a credit card is also annoying.
This is pretty nostalgic for me, my sister and I used to come here and buy the dumbest things.  Like making smoke come out your fingers. It was a fun ride back home. I was 12, that was a very very long time ago. Come to think about it nothing much has changed, I still buy the dumbest things I don't need..

For example, recently I purchased mozzarella cheese making kit that i wil never have time to use or make and poopurri (check it out, hilarious commercial on YouTube)well the poopurri is well worth it..
After several visits to partake of the lunch buffet over the years, I'm still happy to return for some of the best saag paneer I've tried in Vegas. The vegetable korma and the great fluffy basmati rice are also standouts. Gladly would I give greater praise but for the following:

Fresh naan delivered to the table would be most welcome, instead of the rather dried out naan that sits in the heater tray in the buffet line. Also, while it is certainly quite authentic to serve water without ice (I experienced this repeatedly in India years ago), I should not have to ask (multiple times) for a glass of ice in which to pour my room temperature water (call me an American snob). Lastly, the buffet items should be served at a higher temperature. It's all in the details....
My family has been going to this place since it first opened and we love it! It is not your authentic Italian feel, nor is it a nice quiet dinner. But it is good food and a friendly staff. 

The white pizza is amazing (sorry to the other reviewer that did not like it). A quick call on the way home from work will ensure it is ready for you when you arrive to take home. The staff is very friendly and quick to respond to any need you may have. 

Try the penne palermo. It is my standard if I am not in a pizza mood. The sausage and penne are topped with freshly cut mozzarella (delicious!)
My niece came in from LA for the day and since she was staying at the Ritz, I suggested the MercBar.

Always liked this place and still do.  My niece and I had some great conversations over some dirty mules.  

She's a drink aficionado and apparently, the MercBar made the dirty mule to her liking . . .
This place has changed for the worse. They are more focused on scamming you with hidden fees than they are with the members.

I won't even waste my time updating this review. They know they are crooks and I will make sure I tell everyone not to join Gold's Gym. This chain used to be one of the last of the real gyms to train at, what a shame.
Went for happy hour, serve a great menu, get the pretzels with fondue, and home made chips with onion dip, nice draft beer. Environment was bright, cheerful and active. Great stop after shopping at the mall across the street. Will return soon! Ps- manager even took time out to thank me for my review- very nice guy!
I will always have fond memories of my many, many days at Villari's. It's conveniently located for students, and the staff is super cool, friendly, and knowledgeable. 

I spent a lot of time in college kickboxing away the freshman 15 (or 20, as the case may have been). It was fun, and I always looked forward to going back. You'll spend your class doing the perfect combination of shadowboxing and bag work to loud, fun music.

Villari's was by far the best martial arts studio experience I've ever had.
Awesome. Oldies with a chopstick licking good twist, great drinks and vibe.

During a quick trip back to TO, a friend mentioned I should try this new joint that serves up Chinese Jamaican food. Not having had Chinese food nor Jamaican food in a while I wandered up to Bathurst and Dundas to find a small joint with a fun, modern deco Caribbean vibe - not exactly what I expected in the area. 

Starting with some TGIF drinks, they had a decent beer menu, but the cocktails were awesome. You can even get them in a "teapot" which is not only cute, but great value - I think there were like 6 or 7 drinks in there. Try the one with 5 spice and ginger beer, and thank me later. (seriously, Yelp Thank You's are appreciated :) )

Between a few of us we tried a lot, but the real winners here are the Dirty Fried Rice, the Jerk Chicken, Double Down Patty and burger. 
 
You know when you expecting something to be a certain way, but then it's not? Like when you're sure your parents bought you another sweater for Christmas, the box is the right size and shape, but you open it up and you find out it was a camouflaged box and inside is the most awesomest Ninja Turtles toy ever (true story). That's my impression of Patios. Everything has a familiarity to it - but with a twist that makes you think, "wow, that's different". 

Case in point, the fried rice: looking at it you think, "this is going to taste like every other fried rice I've had in my life", but when you take that first bite: BAM. It's got this nice sweet twist that I can't put my finger on. But it that makes you think, why isn't fried rice always made like this? 

Now the burger... man... the burger is done with a pineapple bun (in Chinese, it's called a bo lo bao), this awesome Chinese bread with a slightly sweet\/crunchy\/bready topping that just about every Chinese kid loved growing up. Throw a double patty in the middle of that thing? Brilliant. 

If you're like me and have a thing for rotisserie chicken, you'll love the jerk. It's not your typical jerk chicken that's slathered in sauce, but it's well spiced, a good flavor without being overwhelming, and juicy as heck from the rotisserie. Pair it with a spicy (as heck) sauce, and you got a winner. 

The double-down patty is twist on Colonel Sander's invention, throwing a thick slab of good-ol bacon and melted cheese between two Jamaican patties. Seriously, throwing those ingredients together is like using a cheat code. 

Being away from Toronto for a few months and coming back, it quickly reminded me of the awesome food we have here and the familiarity of the food gave me a sense of deja vu, combining oldies I loved with a new twist.
Great because it's close, food is good and prices are fair. They serve Illy coffee(yay), I get the chicken and waffles or rib eye chiliquilles. By 9am is busy and wait is 30-45 min on weekends, we usually go past brunch time. Thats when i wake up anyway on weekends.So it works out perfectly....hehe
I use to love it here when it first opened and i meet the owner & his wife. But now it is way overcrowded. The coffee taste burnt but is pretty. The last time i was here i had the man taking my order talk down to me. I know the ways espresso is served (not just starbucks) like he said. I do not need a 17 year old being extremely rude to me ABOUT COFFEE. No thanks.
I do my business banking here and find it to be more pleasant than the average bank. The staff is plentiful and cheerful. They have a sort-of middle person who approaches you as you enter to help direct you to the right place - it often seems like overkill, maybe a little patronizing, but I am sure lots of people enter banks not knowing exactly what to do or who to see. It even has character, such as the security guard who loafs around, cracks jokes and participates in what seems to be a mandatory friendly greeting policy within this branch. They also keep a water bowl out front for thirsty critters. Now if only they handed out glasses of wine to customers...

On my last visit, I had to leave a message for a specific employee who was working out of a different branch that day; he called me within the hour! The same person has previously made it clear that it's ok to call his cell, even on the weekend while he was out golfing. 

I do not like to support the golf habits of bankers, nor do I agree with many of the policies of big banks, but this particular branch glosses over all that bad stuff with admirable expertise.
You get what you pay for, so I wasn't expecting anything extravagant. In the future, I'd definitely pay a little more for nicer rooms.

Pros:
- Location is great. You can walk to a bunch of other casinos, clubs, shopping, etc. Caesar's and The Forum Shops are just across the street.
- The pool party is a lot of fun! It's the 21+ pool, good music, lots of people, drinks, etc. Lots of people in their 20's and early 30's.
- Carlos 'n' Charlie's and Margaritaville are inside, and they're both good places to eat and drink. Carlos 'n' Charlie's was a lot of fun.
- Free parking for guests.
- Relatively inexpensive rooms.
- Real flamingos are outside!

Cons:
- Parking is HORRIBLE. It took us about 40 minutes to find a space in the garage.
- The walls are paper thin. I swear, the people in the room next to us never left their room and were always talking loudly. We could hear them anytime we stopped in our room, when we went to bed, and were woken up early by them.
- The rooms are just okay - definitely felt a little dingy\/dirty. The carpets in the halls definitely need a major cleaning or just replaced all together.
- We booked a room with 2 queen beds, and somehow we ended up with a room with 1 king bed. They said they did not have any with 2 beds available at all. That was weird. We didn't mind sharing the bed, but what if we had come with 4 people supposed to share 2 beds? It was Fourth of July weekend, so I guess I understand. But I don't know. It was just annoying.
I have walked by this place numerous times and finally had a chance to go inside. They offer free admission but their hours are fairly limited. 

Built in Scottsdale's first school house, the museum's friendly volunteers explained the structure of the building is original and the roof was replaced more recently. You can walk through the small exhibit in about 10 to 15 minutes. It includes an example of an old classroom. One thing that was pretty neat was the display of the original rules school house teachers had to abide by, back in the day. They were pretty intense and crazy strict (especially for female teachers)! 

The two elderly volunteers were very friendly and eager to tell you all about Scottsdale history. A+ for enthusiasm!

I wouldn't make a special trip to this place but if you happen to be walking along Scottsdale Mall and stumble upon it while they are open, stop in and check them out!
Good service, good pizza (the spicy sausage was fantastic), but ridiculously loud music.  I've only ever been in maybe one restaurant in my life that blasted music near this volume (Joyride Tacos).  The music genre and selections also did not agree with me at all.  It wasn't a relaxing experience, and while the waiter was apologetic and even lowered the music a little for me, it just wasn't a good atmosphere to wind down after a stressful day at work.  Next time I will order my food to go.
I have to say that this is probably one of my favorite spots now! So here is the thing that everybody needs to know about Brews Brothers or what I want you to know... When you think of Brew Brothers, don't think gourmet meal or anything. 

Think, awesome burger and great beer with your friends after work and just letting the aches and pains of the day run through you like your 20oz beer does. Now for Wisconsinites, here is why it is fantastic; BEER. Beer, beer and more beer. There are so many beer choices and GOOD beer choices that it takes me literally 5-10 minutes to decide. It's cheap, plentiful, and delicious and there is a beer there for everybody (including cider for those not bold enough). The food is better than I expected and REALLY good for a place, that I like to call, "a dive-chain." What do you mean Colin?! You're not making any sense! Well I mean, Brews Brothers is in fact a chain. It's not a LARGE chain, with only two locations, but in the sense of the word it is. 

Now the reason I call it a dive-chain is because it really isn't taking itself too seriously. They really make you feel hey, grab a couple beers, have a burger, laugh with your friends, and we'll see you next week. They exhibit their beers in front of you as you walk up to the bar as if it were a museum or parade of beer and it is something to be marveled at. So many beer taps striving for your attention. The greasy smell of burgers attacking your nose urging you to have one. It is simply a relaxing place to go. Staff? INCREDIBLY friendly and really make you feel like a regular. Now for those who know my posts etc. They know I love it when a place makes you feel as though you've never left and thats exactly how they make you feel. 

Now I REALLY really want to give this 5 stars but there are two big things that are nagging me. The first is the location, it is in sort of an odd place which is in between a sub shop and salad shop with a Yoga studio upstairs in a strip mall. It would be great if they were lucky enough to have a stand alone building but, such is life. The second is that I feel in this age and in Madison, even a beer bar needs to offer some liquor. I have had friends join me at this wonderful spot to be really disappointed that they didn't offer any sort of liquor. They settled for cider (simply because they don't drink beer) which is crazy to most but I understood it.\

Simply put by their own slogan (on the back of their shirts, and yes, one that I bought...) "Brews Brothers: Where good people drink good beer
Got my garage door fixed on Friday morning ! Quick response, Excellent service and great job by Perry from neighborhood garage door service.
Amazing place.  Their food is fantastic and the vibes make it the perfect place to sit down and socialize, chill, or do work.
I had the spinach enchilada, and it was delicious!  The service my friends and I received here was also great.  The server was very friendly and attentive.  If I lived in Phoenix, I'd likely be back here.  (Only small complaint: wish they had more for vegetarians!)
I went in to look for a protector sleeve for my 17" laptop, but they only carry for Macbooks. Oh well, I won't get any support here. But, in all honesty, the guys that work there are as helpful as they can be. Very friendly. Stop in for a visit...especially if you're waiting for your sisters while shopping for shoes lol
If you can only go to one mall in Arizona- this is it. Catering to tourists this mall is anchored by Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Macy's, and Dillard's.  Of course I only really need Nordstrom of those- but FYI.

The parking is a pain so I opt for the Nordstrom (blue garage) parking structure or if visiting during an off peak time the open lot near Starbucks and yard house works well.  If I park in the open lot I'll enter through anthropologie right near that lot.

You can walk forever in this mall and it can be overwhelming for first time visitors.

I like the food across the street in the waterfront area better than the mall chain restaurants.  I suggest lunch at Olive & Ivy and then walk to Nordstrom and get to the mall through there.
I've been hearing great things about this restaurant through friends and reviews, so I finally had to go try it myself and it was so good! We heard the omakase was very good, but we wanted to try some items off the menu for our first visit. Here is what we ordered: Spider Roll, Foie Gras Sushi, Tempura Dinner, and Chirashi Deluxe. The Spider Roll which has soft crab shell in it, was very mediocre. So don't think we will be ordering maki in our future visit. I have had Foie Gras Sushi at other Japanese restaurants, but this one was the best! A must order! Torched perfectly and just melts in your mouth. The Tempura Dinner was very good. Everything was nicely battered and great portions. It came with 6 pieces of shrimps, and a good variety of vegetables like mushrooms, taro, eggplant, yam, and zucchini. I would also highly recommend the Chirashi Deluxe, the sashimi was so fresh and so much variety. There was salmon, toro, uni, amber jack, roe, unagi, octopus, shrimp, and more! Also the sushi rice was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. So happy to have an authentic Japanese restaurant in the 905. I heard the Chef trained Sushi Kaji.I would have given it a 5 if the roll was a little better and they used fresh wasabi.
Yum!  We met a couple friends at the Vig for their new Monday $5 burger and fries special - what a steal!  Add that to great happy hour specials and you've got a night out on a budget!

I started with the lemonade while everyone else had a beer, and my husband was happy to see the Dogfish 90 minute on the menu. 

For dinner, I went with the greek salad with a side of sweet potato fries (of course!).  The greek salad was huge and came with some pita bread, so this was definitely a great choice for an entree.  The sweet potato fries were delicious, but I was not a fan of the yellow dipping sauce they came with.  What even was that?  No one could figure it out.  The boys loved their burgers and fries.  Definitely big portions!  

Our service was so-so, but nobody seemed to mind.  It allowed us plenty of time to chat and just relax, which was nice.  

I wish there were more choices like this in Chandler!  Until then, we'll definitely take the trek back to the Vig, especially when it gets cooler and we can take advantage of the patio.
Came in the other night with a group of friends, we had time to kill after a wedding and we were waiting on the reception. The waitress was very attentive, each couple ordered chicken fingers to share and it was plenty of food, and the best chicken fingers I've ever had! Wish this place wasn't so far from where we lived or we would come back ASAP!
Amazing GRILL chicken wings. Over price but good cold beer. Awesome place to watch sports.
If you're looking for an authentic Caribbean experience this spot delivers. The jerk chicken was on point. Very good jerk sauce snd tender chicken. Red rice. Plantains. This place is definitely a hole in the wall and service can sometimes be slow but I'll be back.
I usually don't write reviews. I will make an exception in this case. Sone was able to fix my car the first day I brought it to them. They are very trustworthy. I was satisfied. I highly recommend them to anyone that needs their car repaired. I live in the Boston area and wish I could use them myself. I brought my sister-in-law's car down when I recently was on a visit and noticed it did have a significant issue with it. Thank you Sone.
This is your classic dive-asian-restaurant-take-out-buffet-joint-and-ma-pa-convenience-store. 

This places specializes in quick take out food, with a steam table of rice and other Vietnamese deli foods to make assorted Com dishes.
There are also a few shelves of desserts and deli\/convenience foods.  

But it has about 6 tables to sit and eat, and you can watch the TV with a DVD playing over and over again the traditional Vietnamese outfit contest portion of the Miss Universe Pageant in Nha Trang, Vietnam,

They have a decent smattering of Vietnamese fair in a grungy envirnment devoid of any charm, but the food is pretty good. Khai Vi, Pho Bo (about 17 combos) Hu Tieu, Mi Xao, Com Dia, Che, and special dishes like Bun Bo Hue, Bun Rieu,  Banh Cuon, Goi Du Du, Nem Nuong Cuon, etc. 

They also have Boba drinks, coffees, etc.

Don't expect great service. 

The Pho Tai Bo Vien and Pho Tai came in quite large bowls, with full size rounds of rare beef and decent size meat balls. There was also a lot of noodles, more than most places. Only $4.99, good price even for San Jose or Little Saigon. 

If you want quick to go Viet food, or a cheap and large bowl of Pho in Las Vegas, try here. It is in a 2 story strip mall just below Korean Garden BBQ.

Open 7 days a week, 9 AM til 9 PM.
Who doesn't appreciate convenience!
Drive-thru, mobile app and the need for obtaining and digesting caffeine is easy at this location :)
Very   nice     bar     !!!      Belle  ambiance  !!!  Vraiment  conviviale
yum yum yum!

Went with a party of four - we were seated immediately. The waitress was quick and polite and answered all of our questions. The owner was really sweet and came over to our table to explain a dish to us since we weren't familiar with burmese food. 

Everyone was really happy with their meals and extra points for so many veggie options! 

Definitely will be back again!
It was on the spur of the moment that we decided to try this place.  There was a wait and we were starving.  We almost decided to go somewhere else.  I am so glad we stayed.  My family loves pizza but I am not as big a fan.  I will tell you that if you love pizza you should try this place.  It was the best pizza I have ever tasted.  My husband loved every bite and agreed that it was the best.  Their homemade sauce was at the center of this delicious masterpiece.  We started with the spinach salad and the bread and oil.  These were perfect starters and both totally delicious.  We got the Italian Stallion and the Salvatore to share.  They were both delicious and I found myself wanting more.  My in-laws got the lasagna and the chicken marsala.  I was able to try both of these and they were also both delicious.  We got the plain cheesecake and the raspberry drizzled cheesecake as well as the cannoli.  They again were all divine.  The next day we all started discussing when we should go back.  I surely can't wait.
I haven't had any of the food here yet, but the wine and drinks are amazing!  The bartenders are all great - friendly and attentive, and of course, they make very yummy mixed drinks.  Look forward to coming back here and sampling some of the cuisine...
worse customer service ever. 
Manager on duty was rude. She didn't care that I had negative feelings about this place when I said that I would never come back again!
Restaurant has gone downhill since they renovated!!
I really love the service at this local spot. I pop in for lunch and they are fast and friendly. The burgers are amazing. I suggest trying the hangover burger with the fried egg and the poblano pepper. Even the smaller burger is huge. I love the assortment of buns and the spicy ketchup. They have a nice relaxed atmosphere where you will want to stay a while and relax. The decor looks like it belongs on a beach and the people are fantastic. It is always clean and food arrives quickly.
We were in Vegas looking for a cafe to eat something small and affordable before we started our day. I yelped this place and didn't realize it was in a mall until we arrived. I don't ever think mall food is good BUT THIS PLACE WAS SOOOOO DELICIOUS!!! SO GOOD THAT WE ATE HERE BOTH DAYS WE WERE IN VEGAS. The chicken salad sandwich on croissant bread is to die for. The horrchata is good as well. Very nice and friendly people. I highly recommend this little gem in Vegas, off the strip.
Located in the Sanctuary Resort at Camelback Mountain, this bar has comfy seating to take in awesome views of the surrounding mountains. It's also nice to walk around the resort and take in all the beautiful scenic fountains, fire pits and lighting, especially at night. 

I heard this was an excellent spot to watch the sunset so my husband and I wanted to make sure we got there early enough to do so. We arrived around 5pm on a Saturday to get a good seat. I was a little surprised and disappointed because the bar doesn't actually face west so there really wasn't a view of the sun setting. The ambience and service were nice but we didn't get that "wow" sunset view like we were expecting. 

Menu here is the same as the one offered at Elements restaurant, adjacent to Jade Bar. It changes to the dinner menu around 5:30pm. To me the two menus looked very very similar. Pricey and not a tremendous amount of exciting selections. We decided to split the Jade Bar Burger, which came served with fries. To me it wasn't worth $19 - but steep prices are to be expected at a touristy resort, I guess.

All in all, very nice property to check out but I'm not sure this would be my go-to for dinner, tapas or views in the future. Still, a very nice spot in the valley.
*Opened by the same owners as Kingyo Izakaya. 
*The restaurant was decently sized with Asian inspired decorations, open kitchen by the front and a dragon mural along one side of the wall

-Deep fried pork gyoza - $5.2
These had a nice crispy skin while having a great filling packed with flavors.

-Takoyaki - $4.8
These takoyaki from ramen Isshin were undoubtedly the best takoyaki that I have had in Toronto so far. They were crispy on the outside, yet still soft and moist and not-fully-cooked on the inside. There were a big chunks of perfectly cooked and tender octopus tentacles inside each takoyaki as well! I also loved how prominent the flavor of the bonito flakes and mayonnaise were, while the takoyaki sauce was just sweet enough to balance out the flavors.

-Chicken Karaage - $4.9
Thought the chicken karaage were perfectly seasoned and tasty, they weren't the best I've had. I found the karaage to be too a bit too oily and the batter wasn't as crispy as the one I had at Gushi.

-White sesame shio ramen: $9.6
Friend ordered this which came with a pestle and mortar to grind your own seeds and put into the ramen yourself. To be honest, I thought the sesame seeds didn't have the rich aroma and flavor I expected, thus it really didn't add much to the ramen. It was also quite difficult to grind the seeds, but kudos on giving this experience to their customers.

-Red Dragon Ramen - $14.9
 The noodle came with a thick noodles that were bouncy and cooked in right texture. The broth had just the right amount of spiciness and it was more fatty compared to the shio or shoyu ramen. Actually, I found that the broth here had a more delicate flavor and they weren't as oily as other places - which is my personal preference when it comes to ramen broth. Their chasu is about 90% meat and 10% fat, and they tasted amazing! It was tender yet chewy at the same time. I also noticed how the bamboo shoots were pretty much the basic topping for all the ramen here.

The only complain I would have about my ramen was how salty it was, but not MSG salty! I actually had to ask the server for a bowl of plain soup to add into bowl, which should reduce the saltiness but even then, it was still too much for me to handle.
When you're drunk and hungry from walking so much and also craving for seafood? Then try out this place. I'm a huge seafood person and not going to lie there are better places out there for seafood but first time here I really like their crab legs and sushi. I think its fresh ether that or I was too drunk to notice the difference haahha over all I'd come back here when I'm in town again. :)
I really enjoy this Starbucks and wish it was closer to my home. Most Starbucks are created equal as far as product goes but this location offers superb customer service. The employee working the drive-thru is always incredibly friendly and makes small talk..a nice gesture that doesn't happen very often anymore. Will return whenever I can for my caramel macchiato!
With a young toddler running around, we badly needed our TV mounted. Mythic was one of the first places we called. The customer service was stellar! We received an immediate quote and they were able to schedule service within the week. It took about 90 minutes and the end result was perfection. Our setup looks great and it really opened up our living room. I also can breathe of a sign of relief not having to worry about our little one and a TV accident. Thanks for making our house safer and providing a great experience! No hesitation giving Mythic 5 stars.
We don't go out to eat a lot but when we do we like places that are a little different. This evening after a quick search on the net we discovered this place and thought we'd give it a try.

I had the Rambo Burger and my girlfriend had the Cheesy Burger. Both items were awesome. I was a little worried that the fries wouldn't be to good having read some of the reviews. We found them to be just fine. No complaints from us.

The decor was great and the service was fantastic. We'll definitely visit this place again.
Beautiful fields and a brand new facility. This is a great place to catch a spring training game. The food is pretty standard fare with a few curve balls (get it?) that showcase Arizona culture. Looking forward to next spring!
Worst Wendy's ever for being close to the strip this Wendy's sucks ass the had me wait for fresh fries and once I got my order fried were soaked in oil, and my burger was far beyond well done. Discussing never going back and not even a bother to complain if it's the whole store!! Nasty as Wendy's I wonder how there cooking at home is
I was really hoping to enjoy this place.  Great location in a modern building. The problem was more with the kitchen than anything else.

Came when there wasn't a crowd and was asked to sit inside or outside. Chose inside and was seated quickly in the middle of a long row of tables.  Waitress was very friendly and the service was quite good. We ordered and waited.

My stepdaughter had the Kobe burger and asked for it to be 'medium', it was rare. My girlfriend asked for the Turkey burger, it was under cooked with a soft white center and had to be sent back to the kitchen. I had the Samburger which as a burger with bacon on it. I asked for it to be medium rare and got it very rare.  I like rare anyway, but not what I had asked for. The buns were nice and soft and the flavor was ok.  On the bright side, the loaded fries were very good, according to my stepdaughter.

There is a lot of new competition in Gilbert and not performing well is not going to help. I am sure other Yelpers liked this place, but it will not be one of my top picks.  I will try it again in a month or two to see if they have fixed their kitchen. I can cook faster and better than these guys. AND, I am not classically trained.
I was hoping the new ownership would bring a newer, more efficiently run restaurant, but that was far from the case. They open at 11am on Saturday's....I know this because that's when I went in to have an early lunch. We were the first table sat outside on their mosquito infested patio. I saw one other table inside with a older couple at it. We ordered drinks, and then quickly ordered our food because we were hungry. 45 minutes later, empty water glass in front of me and still no food. Waitress declares she is doing everything she can but one of the steak entrees takes a long time. I wait 15 more minutes, making my total time at this restaurant 1 hour and 18 minutes. I finally had to get up and walk out because I had prior engagements to be some where and never imagined a simple lunch taking this long. So, NO LUNCH! Unreal how disappointed I was in the wait for food, as well as the lack of eagerness to earn back my business when I was leaving and let them know to cancel my food. Never again.
The ambience of Kazmierz is cool, I like the fact that it's dark inside and looks like a basement wine cellar (with a bar and dance floor of course!) It is pretty laid back and loungy, so nothing like the crazy club scene some of Old Town Scottsdale has going on. I love coming here with friends to enjoy wine and appetizers. Every time I have been, we have had good service and have listened to good live music. I like bringing new people too because they always seem to enjoy it just as much as I do!
Unlike the real Cleopatra who swooned her subjects with her beauty and majestic presence, this Cleopatra is a plain Jane from the exterior.  It's in a non-descript strip mall next to Winco and from the exterior, it looks like a sad, forgotten bar.  And we were a little confused by their hours of operation from 3pm-midnight.
Luckily, this Cleopatra is anything but plain Jane when you walk thru the front door.  It's by no means fancy.  Instead, I felt like minutes before I was in Phoenix, AZ and now I am in another country, more specifically Turkey.
The interior of the restaurant is what I imagine a restaurant in Turkey would be set up.  To the left, big seating area with couches for those communal pipes and drinking of coffee and tea by men.  To the right, lots of table and chairs with numbers on them for what I assume is for karoke singing and dancing as to the right side back there is a band setup, karoke machine, and a dance floor.
The best surprise, which every restaurant strives for and what costumers to write about is that the FOOD was delicious, excellent, and mouth watering yum, yum!
We ordered the Cleopatra salad, spinach pie, falafel, lamb chops and chicken kabob.
The salad dressing on the salad had just the right amount of herbs and tanginess that it opened up our appetite.  My son devoured the chicken kabob and asked if we could get the recipe from the restaurant.  My husband and I loved the spinach pie, falafel, and I loved the lamb chops.  The lamp chops were perfectly grilled.  And the falafels were possibly the best I've ever had.  Slightly crispy on the outside but oh so delicate, moist and flaky on the inside.
Throughout our dinner, we commented that we were soooo happy to have come here, what a pleasant surprise the food was as from the exterior, we did not expect much and how we would definitely return again as good Mediterranean food is hard to find in the Valley.
So Cleopatra, thanks for a wonderful dining experience and see you soon again!
Tiny place in the Greenland food court. Decent bibimbop that was a tad skimpy on the meat but overall satisfying especially with the hot sauce and I added kimchi that took it up a notch. The bulgogi serving was huge, and pollack soup had a nice mild flavor. Banchan consisted of only kinchi, pickled radish and sprouts, so they could do better there, but overall a good meal in the cafeteria. Family was happy with everything.
Love their shoyu ramen with runny yolk soy marinated egg. Tried the cheese and garlic ramen, but did not like it one bit. Good but overpriced gyoza. Good Japanese beer selection.

Only cons: overpriced for the amount of time I had to stand in line on the cold. You can't wait inside because the place is too small.
WHERE IS MY SLICE OF FRENCH BAGUETTE?  I  like their salad, I like their soup, but---their ads both in their literature and their lighted board at the restaurant states that I will receive a "slice of French baguette" with their soup.  What I did get was  a pull-apart roll.  A doughy, cold, pull-apart roll is not anywhere a French baguette slice!  Either provide what you advertise or tape over the board and flyers. Some would call it FALSE ADVERTISING!
Clean store. Staff was nice. They had lots of christmas clerance toys yay!
The service is like 1 out 5 .. the food was alright ordered the beef and taste like rubber it doesn't taste like beef at all  .. I ordered an appetizer egg roll, I didn't receive it and when I ask for the tab it wasn't even ranged up I mean she repeated the order why wasn't serve ? Smh I went thru the review that's why I wanted to try this place I guess it wasn't that accurate at all
This is a small predominantly Japanese market with a small selection of frozen items to compliment the large selection of boxed and canned groceries.

New Tokyo is the closest store to me that has a decent daifuku mochi, so they get stars for that.  They also carry Lotte Mochi Ice, a lighter (lower fat) version of your usual mochi ice cream.  And yes, they carry mochi ice cream too!

I've also purchased fish cake, S&S instant dashi, ponzu sauce, ramen noodles, Portuguese sausage, and other assorted items from here.  They carry a selection of Gatsby Moving Rubber men's hair product, which is a nice alternative to ordering it on Amazon.

I can't give them a 5, since they are often out of items I am looking for (white black bean daifuku mochi), but on the other hand, the owner and employees are extremely nice, and there's always parking.  I highly reccomend checking New Tokyo out!
Brooke is amazing. Normally when you get a haircut from a salon owner it costs a lot of money but I've never paid more than $30 for a haircut from Brooke. It looks perfect every time! I've also had my nails done with Amber and they came out great the two times I got them done. This is an excellent, small place. It's also convenient to downtown so I usually go over after getting off work!
We reserved a table at Cafe Monte last Saturday for a special occasion dinner. The front half of the restaurant really does feel like a french bistro, and with a wonderful duet of a trumpet player and a piano player, the music was great.

Service was attentive. We brought a bottle of wine from our cellar and corkage was $15. Our server noticed the bottle in its neoprene carrier as soon as she showed up and asked if we had white or red, and what style glasses we wanted. 

My husband and I were both dying to try the steak frites, since we loved that dish in our favorite restaurant Paris. He ordered his au poivre, and I ordered mine with Bearnaise sauce. I'm docking Cafe Monte one star because they completely undercooked my steak. I ordered it medium, and I received a steak that was rare, as in cool in the middle. My husband ordered his medium rare and he also received a rare steak.

I prefer my steaks medium, but will eat just about any steak on either end of the spectrum of doneness so as to avoid sending it back and risking spit, so I kept my mouth shut. Be prepared to have your steak undercooked if you eat here.

Aside from that one issue, everything was great. Hopefully they'll get some more knowledgeable cooks in the kitchen in the future.
This is a really good find! It's a small, little restaurant with sort of demented decor, but the food is excellent. 

I went with my sister and husband and we were sat down in the small space. Ethiopian is eaten with your hands, so I went to the bathroom to wash my hands. The bathroom is upstairs where there is another upper part of the restaurant and a small bar. 

The bathroom was clean, although I did notice a cockroach trap in the corner. I want to specify that the washroom was perfectly clean and I never saw any bugs. It was mildly disconcerting, but you'd probably be hard pressed to find any restaurant in downtown without a stray roach SOMEWHERE kicking around in it. Let's just be real!

Anyway, myself and my sister ordered a combo dish of a small portion of all of their veggie options, for two. My husband ordered their "special",which was a chicken dish, served with a whole, hard boiled egg.

Our meals arrived and my sister and my meal, was served on a large platter, with spoonfuls of the various dishes all around and a small salad in the middle. Certain parts were better than others, but that's probably a personal preference and nothing was bad. Just good and GOODER (yeah, I KNOW it's not a word).

The prices were also extremely reasonable. The portions of injera (the flat bread you eat the food with) were large and we were given 2 pieces each. That's ALL you would need, but if you're REALLY hungry, the food is served on a large piece of it, so you can literally eat your plate. 

Those are the good things. Now onto the not so good things.

The service was a little lacking. We ordered their special coffee at the beginning of the meal, as requested in the menu, only to be told they were not serving it anymore that day. We were there at around 8:30 and the restaurant closes at 11pm, according to their website. Why was it no longer being served??

Our waitress seemed sort of displeased with us being there in general. She was not very friendly. She avoided eye contact with us most of the night, which made it really hard to get her attention to get the bill and to pay. 

My sister and I were sitting across from each other and when our food was served our injera was on one plate. I asked if I could have another plate, to put my injera on and I got the dirtiest look you could imagine and the waitress turned on her heel without a word. She did get us a plate though. 

Normally, this type of service would be a real turn-off, but honestly the food was so damn good and the prices so damn good, I'm not even going to let it deter me! 

I WILL be back Ethiopian House Waitress! You can't keep me away!
I mean, here's the thing....the pizza was really delicious. BUT they do indeed cheap out with the ingredients, as others have said. 

We ordered the Margherita pizza from their "gourmet" pizza menu. It describes the pizza as extra virgin olive oil, mozzarella, provolone, tomatoes, basil, parmesan. The pizza was cheesy and delicious...but there was about one tomato per slice of pizza and the basil was the dried, "spice" kind that you shake out of a jar, instead of fresh basil. So I mean the ingredients are anything but gourmet. But it was still really yummy, I won't deny. 

The garlic parm bread was like a slightly classier, better crazy bread from Little Caesars. Also good. 

I won't hesitate to come back here, but it won't be a go-to. The prices aren't cheap and the ingredients not what I would expect given the prices...and the descriptions.
I am bringing all of suits and dress shirts here from now on. This place actually tailors your clothes properly so they fit you. I wish I would have known about this place before I let the people at Men's Warehouse ruin my suits I purchased from there.

From now on when I purchase suits I am bringing them straight here. The lady here is a professional and does an excellent job!!
Mmmm, bacon cheeseburger and fries. I'm very critical of burgers because I'm a burg hag.

With that said, Sidewalk Cafe has one of the tastiest bacon cheeseburger I've ever had! Deeeeelish.

The service is pretty quick too. This isn't McDonald's; everything here is made to order so you do have to wait. But it's worth it and this is coming from someone who is impatient.

Eat in the diner or go through the drive-thru and you won't be disappointed!
Nice patio overlooking Camelback Mountain. Unfortunately the flies were so aggressive we had to move to a table inside midway through our meal. 

Took advantage of the Happy Hour menu and tried a bunch of the apps. Here is my impression of each:

Chicken tacos- kinda dry and needed a dipping sauce. Over abundance of weird lettuce filling and not much else other than little chunks of chicken.

Soft pretzels- ok. Not the best in this region. Dipping sauce was also just ok. 

Chicken wings - pretty good. Unique flavor. 

Calamari- ok. No dipping sauce but came with a red pepper drizzle. Not super flavorful. 

Overall the food was nothing spectacular. Outdoor ambience would've been nice if the flies weren't attacking us. Indoor is cute.
I was misled into this place thinking it was a revolving sushi bar but when I walked inside, it was clearly not. I was seated in a booth and my waitress did not speak very good English. I had to call her over every time I wanted to order or needed a refill on my water. I did come in for lunch and was told about the all you can eat lunch. I felt this was a good deal so I ordered. The flavor of the sushi was just OK- nothing tasted great. 

I would not return.
My husband and I are in the market for a new SUV.  Well, new to us since I don't believe in buying a brand new car (hello depreciation!).  After some searching, we found a 2008 LX 470 at this dealership and made an appointment with Brian to check it out.  

Upon arrival, Brian was finally tracked down and told me he thought we didn't have an appointment until later.....nope, not the case.  He was busy with another customer, and passed us on to someone else.  Not a good first impression.  

The salesman we did work with was great.  Here's the thing.  I grew up in the car industry with my dad owning a GM dealership, so I know how these things work.  He did a good job of trying to sell us without over doing it and turning us off.  Ultimately, the SUV wasn't what we were looking for, but if they get another one in that's a better fit we'll probably return.  

In addition - the dealership is gorgeous and you can tell they take care of their customers!
Amazing Hotel. Haw can anyone not like this place. Great service, great rooms, great tables, this was everything you could wish for. 
Went to the pool as well, hard to find anywhere to sit, but 3 - 4 pools so loads of space to swim and relax.
Right in the centre of the strip so great location, and fountains are icing on cake. 

If I can afford it would stay here again.
Ok ok so I may have been dragging my feet on writing this review. I wanted to keep Deep Sea all to myself!! Muah hahahah...

This place is amazing. Deep Sea is a seafood market that sells the freshest seafood around, from 11-2 Monday through Saturday it turns into a lunch spot. It is quite unassuming from the outside. You walk into a simple, clean space. The menu changes daily depending on what is fresh that day. There are a few items that you will always see on the menu. My favorites so far... Any version of the tuna Sandwich, Mahi Mahi Tacos, and the Blackened Catfish Po'Boy. You have two options for sides, steak fries or cilantro slaw. I always get the cilantro slaw. Which is fresh and not mayo heavy. The cilantro adds a pleasant zing to the side. I would be really excited it they added more side choices - maybe a salad or soup option would be nice. 

They have a small seating area with 5 tables total. The tables fill up during peak lunch times. My suggestion, grab your lunch to go and find a nice bench to eat it on and enjoy the outdoors. The man at the counter seems a bit gruff and unfriendly but he is a good guy.

Pricey, and I feel the quality used to be higher...the instant hot chocolate mix I had was very light and sugary, as opposed to more chocolatey like Starbucks' and some of the specialty Belgian brands at AJ's.

Their packaging is still quite nice, though it's basic when you buy only a few individual pieces from the case.  I have a feeling the store's products are much fresher than the department store's boxed displays.  They also offer a much broader variety than department and big box stores that carry the line.

One of the male employees was very friendly when I popped in one evening, and I was able to try a tasty tiny sample of their peppermint bark.  Too bad I had already refilled my Williams-Sonoma tin with a year's supply from Costco...

Overall, a nice compliment to See's in the mall.  It's a bit fancier and has a more luxurious air to it, making it a pretty safe gift destination.
Went here with seven friends. We were greeted warmly. Staff has always been friendly and efficient. Everyone loved what they ordered. Food is well prepared, attractively presented and the portions are more than ample. Several of us had their S5 which consists of noodles, vegtables, shrimp, chicken and pork. Delicious combination. Others had a curry, chicken dish that they enjoyed. One had a pork chop dish that looked every interesting C3.  Nothing was left on their plate.
It's a small restaurant which can be busy at times but it's worth the wait.
My girlfriend and I have lived in Vegas nearly 40 years. We've been through Boulder City many times but never actually stopped anywhere other than to get gas.

Today we decided to play tourist in Boulder City. Most of the shops had friendly staff this was not one of them.

I had a empty coffee cup from another establishment. Upon entering the store I saw a trash can behind the counter. I inquired as to whether or not I could throw my empty cup in the can or was it a antique?

The clerk made some rude comment about yeah go ahead that's all we're good for apparently. I asked her to to repeat herself as I thought perhaps I misunderstood her. She just glared at me.

Needless to say we left after a very short look around.

Overall we had a great time in Boulder City today and plan on returning but we'll definitely skip this place.
Okay, for every negative there is a positive with this place. And I put the 'positive' part after 'negative' because it's really not BAD at all. In any sense of the word. 

I'm always a fan of BYOB places...so there's that.

The place is small but the service is very quick and eager (perhaps too much...she checked on us way too much and there was a definite feeling of her trying really hard to come across as super friendly and nice. It kind of felt like she was part of our conversations). It has a friendly atmosphere and a comfortable vibe to it.

My boyfriend got the pork chops which I'm never a fan of but it was well prepared and the cabbage\/mashed potato bed it was on was delicious. Reminded me of a German eisbein.

I got the beet and bleu cheese salad and it was delicious.  Wayyyyyyy too many beets but I love a little beet dish by itself so I'm really not complaining. Really, it's a great salad. I also got the mussel appetizer and they were the biggest mussels I've ever seen. The only negative is that they were extremely gritty and I felt way too many times like I was crunching on sand and I couldn't finish as it was turning my stomach.

Side note: they have an interesting dip for their bread...a white bean puree in balsamic vinegar and oil. It would have been better had they 86ed the white bean puree. Just really an addition without adding anything.
I think this place is pretty solid. I've been there probably about 10x after moving to area , but i love Asian food. Everything has been fresh tasty. Soups are really good also. Don't know about any msg , didn't ask lol
Jean Philippe storefront is located in front of the elevators to the hotel rooms (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/aQab9yLDDP_R9ZgRDt7MfA?select=EXVvx1O49t64AWTO_zM0CQ).  Perfect for those who stay at Aria as one does not have to go far in order to pick up some breakfast items.  Didn't dine there as there were tons of people enjoying coffee and danishes with no open tables.  Opted to take my coffee and Nutella brioche back to the room to enjoy (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/aQab9yLDDP_R9ZgRDt7MfA?select=Ajg1uOP4C7Q6b1cwbwJ65g). For people that love Nutella, this is a must!  The brioche bread was light and fluffy and was filled with Nutella.  Coffee was good as well and will be back tomorrow to pick up some items to take back home with me (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/aQab9yLDDP_R9ZgRDt7MfA?select=G0sFpyrVp_EIrj4KdG8CHg).

Also picked up some of their macaroons....tried one and it's only ok.  Paulette and Payard's are much better in my opinion.

Okay...if you're a vegan...my apologies.  Probably you don't have a lot of awesome "dining out" experiences that aren't in Tibet, and unfortunately I suspect this is one more venue to get more of the same not awesomeness.  But I need to preface this review with a couple caveats.  

1)  I don't know what "good" tofu tastes like.  I suppose it is hypothetically possible that the tofu I had was good, or even great and that gross texture and vaguely egg-like taste is considered fine tofu dining.
2)  I've never had Jasmine tea.  

Okay...so the good:

The place is new (ish), nicely decorated, and clean as a whistle.  The tables are these polished white lacquer affairs that are so shiny clean you feel like you can eat directly off of them.  

The service was very friendly.

The crispy rolls were great.  I don't know what was in them...as a non-vegan, it wasn't important, because I just wanted to try them, but if there is something that is typically IN a spring roll\/egg roll that deveganizes it...they should just eliminate it in all of them because these were just as good as any "normal" egg roll\/spring rolls.

Okay, so I ordered tea with my meal.  The little old man asked me if I wanted Green tea or Jaasdfdfasdafadsf tea.  I spell it that way because the two or three times I asked him to repeat I couldn't figure out what he was saying, and only after he brought it to the table did I put it together that he was saying jasmine.  He said it would have more flavor and it did.

It also had a lovely floral aroma, except that after inhaling near it, I stopped short and offered a whiff across the table to my lunch companions.

"Smell this." 

One girl took it and inhaled.  "Oh!  That is flowery..., but...."

"Say it," I said.

She looked vaguely uneasy.

"SAY IT!" I repeated.

"It sorta smells like a bathroom air freshener."

"Yeah," I said, "It DOES".  

So this is where my inexperience with Jasmine tea comes in.  MAYBE...maybe jasmine tea is SUPPOSED to smell like a men's room urinal cake.  I don't know.  Maybe it's just an unfortunate Pavlovian association that when I smell jasmine, I think of urinal cakes because so many urinal cakes come standard with "jasmine scent".  So the image that the commercial portray about the woman enjoying the early morning hours with closed eyes, her cup of tea raised gently to her lips, her face enwreathed in aromatic steam...the camera switches over to a summer rain falling softly in a green meadow???  Well when I closed my eyes and put the cup to my lips...the vision that popped into my mind was sitting in the men's room drinking tea from the crapper.  So that was sorta an appetite killer.

The other girl bought a sweet and sour chicken that she said she liked.  The 'soy protein' chicken LOOKED like chicken.  She said it more or less tasted like chicken too, but "Maybe a little gummier."  Okay...I could have dealt with that.  My 'soy protein' was brown...and had an odd texture.  I think it was intended to resemble beef, but if we can return for a moment to my previous men's room analogy...it more resembled something found THERE.  It was a little tough, and I didn't love the taste.

The broth in my soup though?  Spicy and tasted pretty good! 

Okay...so some mistakes were made on MY part.  Jasmine tea = NO.  Bon Hue (what I ordered) = NO.  BUT...I would go again.  I like to try new things, and I feel like there were other things on the menu that offered more promise than the selections I made.  

I give it two stars, but reserve the right to change my mind if at some point (maybe six months from now or so) I return and try something that I like even a LITTLE more than what I selected.
We stopped in here for some coffee to wake us up and warm us up. The line to order was short. That is where the good part ends. There were only 6-8 people in front of us on the other end waiting for drinks, so it seemed like it would not be too long of a wait. Oh was I wrong. The wait was far too lengthy and the staff did not seem eager to fix that. The manager casually strolled around clearly not noticing the back up. The two staff members making the drinks seemed to be enjoying themselves, but in no hurry to get the job done.

After finally receiving my coffee I was then again disappointed. It tasted burnt and I could not detect any of the elaborate flavors in its description. Also please note that I waited that long for a coffee, not a latte or cappuccino.

Had it been busier I would have understood, but the issue seemed to be the staffs ineffectiveness and disregard for getting work done.
While I really enjoyed the noodles, their signature pork buns, which seemed to be something everyone orders and raves about, I did not like at all. The pork was pure fat and while it wasn't gristly, it was SO greasy, the grease positively dripped all over your hands. It was hugely unappetizing. I couldn't taste the cucumbers and didn't see any evidence of scallions. It was basically just pure fat, wrapped in a bland "bun". So I guess if you enjoy really fatty, greasy appetizers, this is the right deal. (Really, I can't stress enough how fatty the pork was...it was purely, white, greasy fat! Either change the name of the dish to pork fat buns, or please add some actual pork!)

The noodles however, were quite good and I liked the flavour combinations. I had the dan dan noodles, which is spicy pork, dried scallops and peanuts. I enjoyed that you could really taste the peanuts. I was a little disappointed that the pork was ground pork, instead of shredded pork. It made the dish seem cheaper and less inspired. 

I liked the atmosphere, but the seating is at long tables and so you share the space with whoever they place next to you. The seats are long benches, so if you're in the middle of the bench, you have to lift your leg over...I saw guys struggling to do this...now imagine being a girl, wearing a skirt and having to do this. No graceful way to go about that!

To be honest, this place just didn't blow me away enough to make a conscious effort to return. It certainly wasn't terrible, but it wasn't really good either.
This hidden, beautiful, delicious restaurant is exactly why I L-O-V-E Yelp!  Last week the boyfriend suggested we go on a "date" and try something new, but preferably in Tempe since that's where we would be shopping prior.  Nothing came to mind, so I browsed Yelp and found Classic Italian Pizza.  It was love at first read.  

Thanks to the prior reviews we were able to find it by searching for the Big Lots sign, and were greeted by a mostly vacant parking lot.  There, in the corner, the restaurant was glowing and inviting.  Upon entering we were surprised to find only 3 other tables full, and this was a Friday night.  Yippee!  No wait!  

We started with the yummy brick oven bread, Caprese salad, a glass of pinot grigio, and Warka (polish beer)....which all came out quickly.  The bread held up to it's expectations - it was the perfect texture of chewy dough and light flavor, brought with a plate of marinara sauce and balsamic.  Next it was on to the pizza - Margharita for me and Pepperoni for the boyfriend.  Both were yummy, hot, and flavorful.  Every table has it's own bottle of olive oil, balsamic, parmesean, and red pepper so we were able to spice our pizza's up just how we like.  Mmmm!

For me, it's not only about the food it's about the ambiance and this place definitely has both.  It's cozy, pleasant, and when you're there you really feel like someone invited you to be in on the secret.
We selected a pie to take to a friend's house for dinner. The crust was delicious and flaky and the filling was REAL .. I've only had the Cherry pie, but I will absolutely be back for more. This place seems like the perfect place to order pies for special occasions such as thanksgiving, Easter, etc. I can promise you they will always be a hit if you take them as a contribution to a meal... my friends all had two slices!

Update I purchased several goodies for a dessert at a friend's house and everything was delicious! We purchased tarts, brownies, truffles, and cookies!
I've been a loyal customer at Aloha Nails for the past five years. Over that time, I've been in probably 100+ times to have my "solar nails" (aka pink & white, aka acrylics, etc. nails) put on, taken off, or maintained.

Today, I'm finally dropping my review from 5 stars to 2 stars. The sole reason? I can't go between visits without these weak nails breaking completely, several times over. 

When I first started going to Aloha Nails, I was also training for a century ride, as a cyclist. I was impressed so much the first time I was pumping up a tire and the inflating hose blew off, slamming me in my hand. My nails didn't suffer so much as a crack!

But for the last four months, I'm finding that 2-3 weeks in between visits isn't enough for me to keep these false nails in even DECENT shape. Since December, I had about four major nail breaks. When I go in to get my nails redone\/repaired, fixing the breaks is often painful, with them wedging the gel\/material off my nailbed using another sharp-edged artificial nail. Now, I've had artificial nails for months on end, and what I can tell you is that the nailbed under the artificial nail is EXCEPTIONALLY sensitive!

So, basically, every visit has featured some amount of pain since December.

This last visit, I found that my pinky nail just flew off while I was closing a car door. Not even hard! I visited today and the woman re-did my nails, cutting off the length. I saw a crack on my right thumbnail and figured she'd repair it before letting me leave.

She finished her work, and I left. And now here I am 3 hours later with a chipped thumbnail because she didn't bother to repair the nail!

My nutrition and body hasn't changed wildly since December, but nails from here are cracking and falling apart right and left. I don't know what they've done differently, but I'm seriously considering a new nail salon for my next visit. Very disappointed.

EDIT\/UPDATE: I received a very kind note from one of the owners of Aloha nails asking me to return so they could take a look at my nails and figure out what was making them break so easily. I appreciate the note, and have added another star because they DO care about their customers being happy, but I've chosen to return to my natural nails after this series of breaks.
One of the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Great lunch & Dinner Buffet with varieties of starter, Veg, non veg food, desserts and also they have salad bar just for $10. The food is delicious.  It's spacious and big restaurant with Beautiful deco.  Good customer service.
Somehow the online menu made me lose my appetite? I cant really even explain why exactly?My friend said it was"good",so I checked out the menu,and well, yeah.....Get a different webpage, and change your name.
We went here for a late lunch (around 1:45-2). We were greeted as soon as we walked in, and host gave us menus and told us we could sit anywhere. It wasn't busy. At all. Within a minute or so, a server came up and took our drink order (I don't think she introduced herself). Once the food came, she came up and asked if we needed anything else. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich drenched in buffalo sauce and a side of collards. The sandwich looked awesome! It was not bad, but I don't think I would order it again. The buffalo sauce was thin so it was just dripping off of the sandwich. And the collards did not taste good (at least to me) - but I'm not going to take anything off for the collards because I have only had them a handful of times in my life. Anyways, we were almost done when she checked on us again. And when we were done we were just sitting there waiting. And waiting. And waiting. She was behind the countertop just on her phone the whole time. Eventually we didn't want to wait anymore so we asked her for the check at the counter. 

I have been here before, several times, but not in the last year. I usually have no problem; their servers are usually on top of everything and always so friendly. But this time felt different... I always get the shrimp & grits, but today we all got something we never had before and I regret the decision. 

I will probably come back, and if I do I will get the shrimp & grits.
I loved the decor in the restaurant.  It's very dim in the restaurant, perfect for a relaxing dinner with friends or loved ones. The service was on the slow side (took 45 min to get food), but we were warned by the server before ordering.  We got the Beer Battered Cod tacos, Sausage tacos and the Lobster tacos.  We also go the complimentary tortilla chips when you order a drink.  Overall the food was okay, but I was not impressed by it.  The flavour was good, but not to the point where I would want to drive 30 minutes for it.  As for the value, it's a bit expensive since it would take about 3-4 tacos to get full so it's about $21-$30 before taxes for one person.  The last thing that really turned me off was seeing the waitress use a towel to wipe the floor then using it again to wipe down the table. Overall the food and service was mediocre.
This is a first and hopefully the last single star I'll award! We have dined at Maria Bonita's (MB) numerous times but not in the last few years...to much traffic and to many miles from home. We found ourselves in the neighborhood and visited an old standby for quality Mexican food.

Not on this particular evening....most everything just went wrong! Start with the drink special which was a pitcher of premium margaritas. A liter carafe filled to the brim with ice. So much so that our server spilled the ice on the table, on my Bride, on the floor and in the glass but delivered very little liquid into the glass. We filled our water glasses with the excessive ice to find about three drinks. Nothing premium here.

My bride ordered the chicken fajitas and our first observation, when served, was no sizzle! A generous portion of veggies and par boiled chicken. Clearly the veggies had been fried in the skillet but the chicken was added to late to be much more than barely warm and lacking any caramelization.

I ordered the Conchinita Pilbil, a favorite in the past. A generous portion of pork shoulder, well seasoned and slow roasted in banana leaves. At first look, my dinner appeared very familiar. Unfortunately, the meat was COLD....like just out of the refrigerator. Caught the eye of a Manager and shared my problem. He apologized profusely and promised to fix the problem. He stated "It will take 8-10 minutes because our food is made to order". 

My second order was not as generous, barely warm, no tortillas, rice or the pickled onions; the fried plantains were all but absent. Very surprising the Manager allowed a meal, so poorly prepared the first time, to leave his kitchen without putting an eyeball on a redo? 

When the bill was presented, I asked our server if the restaurant had changed hands. He responded about a years ago but stated he was a cook and had been pressed into a servers role. "We have two new people in the kitchen!"  No surprise here!

My meal was comped but unfortunately after 93 reviews I was compelled to write my first single star review. No excuse for poor quality food, twice, a server with little experience on the front side of the house and a manager that believe comping mistakes solves the problem. 

Best of luck MB and diners beware!
Such a perfect place- just steps from my front door... Great luck or horrible luck- depends on how you look at it.

I love the extended hours though I've heard if the run out of doughnuts they close early.

I've been here twice and tried the strawberry glazed with sprinkles, chocolate long john, chocolate cake, and raspberry filled doughnuts.  When I spell it out like that it can be guilt inducing but I don't regret it.  The chocolate cake doughnut has to be the highlight since it was soft and fluffy it literally had bounce. 

The people working are very prompt and know their selection very well!  Less than $1 a doughnut and I saw on the menu that a dozen doughnut holes are .99 cents!!
My fav Indian buffet in town. Eaten lunch here a dozen times. Inexpensive. Love the rice pudding, honey rice and chicken chili. Simple but tasty. Wish there was one in Henderson. I'll be back again and again.
Love this place, good prices and selection! The owner is so friendly and knows his products!
Love this place! We go at least once a week, whether it's for their all day breakfast or even a quick after work bite! Servers are super friendly and food comes out fast. Great little diner with the classic "back-in-the-day" decor. I send everyone here when they suggest Coras or some other sub-par chain!
This place is the bomb.  

The owners pulled out all the stops for a luxurious experience.  I love it when I go into a place that is so wonderfully designed, full of attentive staff that my mind goes into a cold freeze and I'm happy to pay $15 for a movie ticket plus $15 for 3 tiny little burger sliders.  I didn't care what the price was, I was so in love with the experience.  Now that's getting the customer hooked.

Saw Twilight Series, Breaking Dawn Part 1 here with 2 other girlfriends and all of us loved it here.  It was the perfect place to see Team Edward or you know, the other team, who?

Don't miss out, grab your gfriends or significant other and go check it out.  Perfect place for a date night.
I generally get my Lomi Lomi with Steve Ibach. Steve was not available today so I had my Lomi Lomi with Jarid. And it was a great session!
Jarid followed the notations from my file so knew how I liked to have my massage. I sensed that he was focused on giving me the best possible massage and there were times when I felt like I lost track of time and was floating, feeling relaxed. It was fantastic!
I had told Jarid some issues I was having with my left knee and inner thigh and he incorporated some therapeutic massage along with the Lomi Lomi which was exactly what I needed.
The room had the right music- and he will adjust the temp if you need it. The room was slightly chilly- still comfortable- I didn't want him to stop the Lomi Lomi to adjust the temperature!
Hawaiian Experience Spa is a great day spa. There are snacks and tea for you to enjoy, cushy robes, sandals. Give yourself an hour after to take a leisurely shower in their opulent setup!
The staff is always friendly. Now I have two favorite massage therapists there- Steve and Jarid!
Wow...where has this place been all my life? Or at least since I moved to Phoenix :) By far and away the best pie I've had in the Valley. At Yelp's suggestion, we tried out this joint with another couple and we all had a great experience. Our wait on a Friday night was only about 15 minutes and during the short interim, we hit up the bar for some drinks. After being seated, our very friendly server explained the specials and took our orders. Between the four of us, we ordered olives, Caesar salads, funghi, BBQ chicken and Yukon gold pizzas. Holy schmoly were they good. It is difficult to find crust like that and you can tell they have the right type of oven to make an amazing pie. The large pizza is plenty big for two people and the pizza my husband and I split (the funghi) was ahhhhhmazing. The flavors were bold, rich and oh so satisfying. 

The quality of food at this restaurant warrants much higher prices than what they charge. Affordable+delicious+great service = a returning patron.
3.5\/5. 

*the server wasn't friendly nor attentive. 

*I found Rock Lobster to be ah-okay, as we went during lobster season, and with that kind of price, the food was supposed to be superb!

*Rock lobster Caesar - $13: 
Trust me, I worked in restaurants before and they all watered down the Caesar, and the one at Rock Lobster is nothing like those tasteless versions at all! We all decided to share this as it was huge for $13, and the drink was garnished with a fresh celery and a boiled half lobster tail! The flavors here were bold and and spicy! However I was quite disappointed with the lobster tail as it was bland and over-cooked.

*Rock Lobster roll - $16 (substitute the chips with seasonal vegetables): 
For $16 I thought the roll was a bit small, however it was filled with big juicy chunks of lobster. The seasoning on the lobster was spot on, and I liked how you still can taste the fresh lobster as it wasn't overly drenched in dressings. The roll was lightly toasted and crisp, not too greasy. The corn was just a typical buttered grill corn, nothing special. 

*Lobster poutine - $15: 
It's not bad, but it's not spectacular either so don't expect too much. I didn't think the lobster made it that much better than any other poutine on the market. At least you are getting big chunks of lobster here, gravy was packed with lobster flavor and fries were crispy. But where are my cheese curds? You can't call this a poutine when there were barely any melted cheese curds...

*Lobster Boil - $22.50: 
For $22.50, this was a bit expensive. Instead of fries, we got the yukon chips on the side and wow, they were pretty much burnt and stale. At least the lobster was perfectly cooked and juicy, seasoned just right too :).
Great Q at their new location with grown up beverages.....SWEET! Plenty of new flat screens to enjoy a game. The new location has a good feel with many of the old familiar faces and a few new ones. Would have given 5 stars but need an improved process for takeout! Lots of grumbling and long lines on a busy Saturday night!

They'll figure it out.....still worth the wait on weekends for the BEST Q around!
Our waitress was Joy which was certainly a true Joy to have. Food was Delish and Service was Priceless. We are from Chicago and truly appreciate good service. The Manager was very delightful as well.
The best thing was the pork belly. Wasn't impressed with the rolls, the baked mussels, dessert, or the menu.. I love sushi Kaya way more.
Perfectly decent sushi, but for me they lose a star because they don't provide the option of brown rice sushi. Lots of the better sushi places are offering that now, so for me there are better choices. No reason not to eat healthy when I eat out.

Now Sushi Friends on the Danforth offers brown rice, so I go there instead. I wish Casa Sushi would too, because I prefer their rolls.
I love sushi and have been to several revolving sushi bars around the Valley. I was in the area of Kiku and thought I would stop in for a weekday lunch. I sat by the bar- my server was nice but not attentive. After waiting 15-20 min for sashimi, I ended up asking the owner what happened and she gave me some free miso soup. I appreciate the effort but the soup was terrible. The sushi unfortunately wasn't good quality so everything tasted off. I wanted to like it but the salmon sashimi literally was 3 different colors. All of the revolving sushi I ate was warm and that surprised me because I got there maybe 30 min after opening. For a $30 lunch plus tip, this was really disappointing. 

Overall, if you really like sushi, I would skip this place.
Fantastic customer service. Grilled cheese, animal style and well done fries. This place speaks for itself...yum!
Have nothing negative to say after a visit for lunch last week.

We were a group of 7 and came in with a reservation at noon. We were seated immediately, the table had been prepared despite the reservation being made only an hour prior.

Although I love nigiri and maki, I took the recommendation of a colleague and had the chicken teriyaki lunch special. For 8.95 this is a great deal for lunch. It comes with miso soup and a green salad, rice, a few tempura fish pieces topped with a delicious hot sauce, pickled vegetables and of course the chicken teriyaki. The teriyaki sauce was deliciously sweet and savoury, and it sat on top of some cabbage which added a nice crunch. Highly recommend it. 

Great value! I'll be back.
Friendly staff. Cool vibe. can't wait to come back. Some of the best and unique sushi I've had in a long time. Stacks well even against the many offerings in Vegas. Surprised me since the food in Scottsdale often doesn't compare to the best of Vegas. Hope these expand across the valley and to other cities. Cool spot.
Settebello's is a pizza place that offers you the thin crust wood fired pizza. The pizzas are about 12" and are usually more than enough for one person. There are about 8 different pizzas on the menu that are about $13 each. You can add items to the pizza, but you could end up paying quite a bit for a 12" pizza, depending on what you add of course. Extra items start at $1 and then go up from there. The menu also consists of salads and appetizers to go along with the pizzas. They have a comfortable dining area with bench style seats, chairs, and booths that are set around wood tables. It is a Rustic decor that goes along with the menu.

We ordered a couple of salads. The Romana Salad and the Beet Salad. Both salads were okay. The arugula was fresh. The beet salad had red and yellow beets. They beets tasted like they were from a can. There was very little cheese on both salads.

We ordered three pizzas and added some items on each pizza. I know now that this type of pizza is known for being a bit soggy towards the middle of the dough after reading about it. I'm not a fan of soggy pizza.

Quattro Formaggi Pizza. I added mushrooms and calamata olives. The pizza was cooked nice and crisp, but the middle was soggy and I could not pick up the slice with out everything falling off.

Marinara Pizza. I added mushrooms, peppers, and onions. This pizza was cooked slightly less than the Quattro and was also soggy in the middle.

Margherita Pizza. I added olives, mushrooms, and artichoke. This pizza dough was under cooked and not at all crispy.

The cooking of the pizzas were very inconsistent. We had three pizzas for one table that were all cooked for different amounts of time, unless their oven was not distributing the heat properly.

The service was excellent. The waitress was very nice. I'm going to cut the pizza maker some slack this time. Their air conditioner was broken and he was cooking by a 900 degree oven. He looked very unhappy, which is quite understandable. So I'll go back again and try the pizzas when it is not a sauna in there.

The bill was $71 for 3 pizzas, 2 salads, and 3 beverages. A bit pricy for what I received. I will give them another try though, because the pizzas would be pretty good if they would have been cooked a bit longer.
********************************************************
Okay. Here is the update. I went back today to give them another try and got a couple pizzas to-go.

Much better. The pizzas were cooked perfect and they were not soggy at all. I figured they were having a problem the first time I was there because their power kept going out.

So, I would definitely recommend this place if you enjoy wood fired pizza.
The food here is really great. It isn't really fancy, but who needs fancy. It is nice, clean, and casual. Everything is fresh and made onsite and they even have Greek beer.  We will be back....soon
Vous êtes tanné de manger du Mcdo, de la poutine, des pointes de pizzas un peu passer date après le club ou bar? Pas de problème, le Mon Nan est ouvert jusqu'à 4h (comme plusieurs restos du quartier chinois) 

C'est succulant. C'est bon! C'est cochon. Je vous conseille le riz frit, général tao, chow mein, homard fruit de mer sel et poivre et les baby ribs au veau...UN DÉLICE...ET pas cher quand on y vas en groupe! On s'entend que la qualité du service n'est pas excellente, ni les supers nappes blanches en plastique, mais on oublie vite ce détail quand on y mange.
Owner is very full of himself and condescending. I asked him about a record I was interested in and he told me that I wouldn't be able to afford it (mind you, he hasn't seen my wallet or my paycheck). The place is never open when they say they will be. Another small business with an attitude... I found what I was looking for on Amazon.com.
I love Kona's happy hour! They have great deals on rolls and the drinks are very affordable. I appreciate that they have many options for vegetarians, including avocado egg rolls which I could eat all day if allowed to do so. The wait staff is efficient and friendly. I probably would recommend a local sushi joint if you're going for a regular\/later meal. Your money will go further at a smaller restaurant.
My carpets look amazing!  Thank you Gene.  You and your brother Ryan did a fantastic job.  My carpets have never looked better.  you guys showed up on time for both the estimate and appointment.  I will def. use you guys again in the future and pass out your cards!!!
Great date night spot. Bit pricey but food was good and service was nice. Lobster bisque was yummy. Blackened sirloin was flavorful and I would order it again. Steak comes with a side which is nice for the price. I would definitely return again. I enjoyed my meal and dining experience.
I needed to replace my aging giant SUV. DriveTime had the car I wanted and transferred it to test drive from another location just for me.  I drove it and loved it. I prequalified online and the rest is history. I love my car, the payments are super low, and best of all, I can pay it off soon with the short loan period.  They made it so easy and trouble free.  Thanks DriveTime!
Great staff, quaility treatment. I have taken my labs to them for years. They saved my dog sam from parvo when she was a puppy and now she is 7 and thankful to arrow for saving her life. Mackenzie my chocolate lab (the one in the photo on the homepage) saw them yesterday and she received top notch care for her arthritis. They are very affordable compared to others around town, considering the level of expertise and care. They are not looking to make a quick buck they are very caring and honest. I would reccomend them to anyone who loves thier pet.
I have always liked Aroma. I find their food is tasty and all the ingredients are nice and fresh. I organize our team lunch and learns so decided to try their catering menu this time around. Everyone really enjoyed the sandwich platter that I ordered. Good variety of sandwich from grilled chicken to avocado (my personal favourite). The quality was as good as eating at the restaurant. The platter also came with two delicious salads, the Aroma Special and Quinoa. Lastly there was a small box of assorted cookies. Will definitely order again!
I went to Joyride with a friend and we were blown away by the customer service and food. The mojito we had was delicious and the tacos were incredible. The crispy fish taco was my favorite. Go as soon as you can! It's right next door to Postino's East which is also outstanding. Both owned by same owner.
So glad I found this place! My friend and I walked over on First Friday after a guy recommended it to us and described it as a place with great "comfort food." It's a few blocks from the more populated, business portion of Roosevelt. Since we were walking at night, it was a little sketchy given it was dark and there were barely any street lights. But the food and service were well worth the 5 minute creepy walk. Plus it made it more of an adventure ;)

This places feels like an outdoor diner, located on a residential block. You order your food at a window and then find a seat outside in the cute little lot. Despite the fact it was First Friday, the wait wasn't long at all. I think this is because, as I mentioned, it's a bit off the main strip of Roosevelt. We were able to easily find a comfortable place to sit and the service was great. I loved how patient the woman taking our order was and her enthusiasm describing their menu :) There's nothing worse than when you're excited to try a new place and the service is lackluster. This woman took her time and even checked on us later once our food arrived.

I tried the crunchy peanut butter, bacon burger with pickles and cheddar cheese. I know, right?! Sounds crazy! It was highly recommended by the person in front of me in line. And just way too weird for me to not try ---and man, am I glad I did! It was SO GOOD! The flavors actually really complimented each other, especially the saltiness of the peanut butter\/bacon and sweetness of the peanut butter\/pickles. The bun was also fantastic and fresh. Descent beef portion too. It came with a side of fries which were cooked to perfection. 

I will definitely be returning. There are a bunch of other delicious sounding items I'd like to try. A place with a cool, hipster vibe to it and the food, service, and unique menu are outstanding!!
There are things they have that I want to try, thus making me want to return which is indeed a bonus. This includes my favorite treat, red velvet cake.

The breve I had wasn't bad and it's a very relaxing place to sit and get some work done. It's sad I always seem to forget about it. 

One thing I don't like is the wifi. It works similar to those at hotels where you have to sign into a web page. I don't expect it and therefore dislike it greatly.
An unpretentious, casual restaurant-bar with terrific food. I've been here a few times and after sampling a good portion of the menu I can attest that the food does live up to the hype!

My favorite dish was the mini pancakes (banh khot). I was sitting at the bar yesterday and was mesmerized by how much care the chef put in making them. He patiently pampered them until they were crispy all around yet bouncy on the inside. The pancakes were topped with a mixture of ground pork and shrimp and sweetened with coconut milk. They were then ready to be dunk in a homemade fish sauce; a real treat! You get six mini pancakes in one portion; I shared everything tapas-style but I could have easily finished the plate on my own.

Another highlight was the beef carpaccio. In contrast with its Italian counterpart, the Vietnamese version is really heavy on the lime juice (which I love). There's also no raw egg in this version, just a lot of crispy fried shallots and peanuts. 

Red Tiger offers spring rolls rolled in square (pretty cool!) rice paper and filled with either a shrimp or pork sausage, or tofu. I tried the non-vegetarian options and liked it, but wasn't wowed by it. The addition of what seemed to be fried egg wrapping paper was a nice touch since it added dimension to the roll, though. If you are craving meat, I'd definitely recommend ordering the fried chicken wings or skewers. They are a must!

My only complaint would be that the cocktails, while good, seemed watered down and didn't deliver the same punch as the food.

Overall, it's a good place to come to if you want to dance to 80-90's music on your bar stool and indulge in a type of cuisine we rarely come across in Montreal. It's open late too, which is always a plus!
This was my third time at this The Good Egg. It is a nice place with friendly staff and no wait. The food is good and I like the fact that they give you some guidance on calorie count per meal.  With this place being so close to home, it sure beats the McDonald's across the street.
Convenient location, good donuts and coffee. Unfortunately the day I was here, typical Dunkin Donut experience- poorly trained staff. Nice but poorly trained. Don't know- Dunkin Donuts keep popping up so they must be doing okay with their bottom line. 
Still, just think of the increased volume of business with a well trained staff! I did discover that I love their dark roast coffee!  Delicious, hot & full of flavor!!!
Not a ton of vegetarian options, but I had their veggie fajitas, and they didn't disappoint.  The service was great, and the place has a nice vibe to it.  The only thing that surprised me was when one of the (typically Strip) photographers approached my friend and I and asked if we wanted pictures.  We're locals, and just friends, so... no thanks.  I thought this locale might've been off the Strip enough to escape that phenomenon, but apparently not.  I'm not irritated by it; actually my friend and I thought it was funny.  Anyway, a solid choice for Mexican food in town; I'm sure I'll be back at some point.
There are a lot mediocre coffee places in Phoenix but this isn't one of them. I had the most amazing Cappuccino here. The best I have found so far. It was very smooth, I swear they added an angel tear to top it off.
I also tried this raspberry square pastry the was oh so good. Not overly sweet but just sweet enough and the crust had the great buttery taste. 
This is definitely a place to go back try and try their other drinks and eats.
We were back again to the 24\/7 after the completion of the Big Air Bash.  This time, however, was not near as good of an experience.  The place was only about half full, yet we had to wait over 20 minutes because they were short staffed.  This is not my problem and it should not effect my experience in any way.

Once we were sat our server was friendly and attentive.  The food was ok.  It is what you would expect from a 24 hour cafe.  I did the build your own omelette.  It came with ample ingredients, but I needed to add hot sauce to give it more flavor.
This is one of my favorite places to eat when Italian food is craved. All of the menu items I've had have been excellent but the speacials are always to die for!
Fabulous store and owner! Margo is so helpful and knows what styles work and are complimentary. Love the fact that she carries Canadian designers that are made in Canada. Bought some great items that are so comfortable and are washable!
I started going to this nail salon last summer, so for almost a year now. It had just opened when I started going and I walked in off the street because I figured I'd take a chance, it looked clean and it was close to home. 
I was greeted by the owner, a pleasant Chinese woman, who did my nails that day. Since then, I've been back at least once a month for manicures and pedicures. Those are the only things I've had done, but I would suspect that the other services are pretty good as well. 
The spa is new and everything is spacious and clean. They have massaging chairs for pedicures and the prices are reasonable. 
It's a basic nail place, so the bells and whistles are not numerous, but that suits me fine because it keeps the price down, allows for walk-ins and gets you in and out pretty quickly. 
Some of the ladies in the salon do a better job than others, but no one does a bad job. I have had plenty of bad manicures before, so I know what a bad job looks like. Just don't go expecting someone to fuss over you, or give you plenty of conversation. English is not the first language and I have never felt the need to force conversation. 
In this past year I have noticed a huge increase in the number of people that go to this spa, so they seem to be doing quite well. I have never had to wait more than ten minutes for service though and I'm happier they are busy because it means they are doing well and will stay in business. Good for them AND for me! 
Some of the services they give include manicures, pedicures, gel nails, waxing, threading, eyebrow tinting and ear candles.
Pizzas were great! Two of us split two pizzas and took home extras. Pizzas both came with pickles on them (awesome) but be warned: they're bread and butter pickles, not kosher dill :( I didn't drink but husband said beer selection was fun (but not extensive). Oreo cheesecake was silky smooth and delicious!
After time this Cracker Barrel has improved and worked out some of its issues and I have been eating their on a more regular bases. In particular we have got to know a Zack one of the morning waiters. Zack is both professional and friendly, makes you feel very comfortable. Overall the breakfast food has improved as well as the service however, can't say that for the evening meals and service yet though! Not quite ready to give it a 5 star but happy to see it improving.
Dr. Sabitino is great.  He is like your next door uncle, unrelated by blood but totally adoptable.  His staff is great too.  All women and all very friendly and professional.
I think what drew my husband and I into deciding to use him as the orthodontist for our son is the bright cheerfulness of the woman who meets all the potential patients and the bright, clean, modern look of his office.  We just felt very comfortable there the moment we walked into the office.
He has provided excellent care for our son.  Anytime my son had an issue, we were able to call and he would see him right away.  Nothing is too small or too big to make sure things are done right and my son is happy with his braces or retainer.
I've called a couple of times with concerns for his retainer and my concerns were taken care of right away.  Which is what every parent wants.  
I would highly recommend this office to any mom or dad looking for an orthodontist for themselves or their kids.  I think you would be very happy with the services you will receive here.  From the front receptionist to the technicians to Dr. Sabitino himself.
And if you do end up going to Dr. Sabitino from reading this Yelp review, can you mention my name for two reasons:  one, to let Dr. Sabitino I appreciate what he is doing for my son and I'm Yelping about him and two cause I think I get a free tooth brush if he gets new patients from me . . . just kidding about the second reason~ although, I would not mind getting new tooth brushes- can always use them!  It's really because I want Dr. Sabitino to know that he has satisfied patients and we are happy with him!
I'm not a car guy, but I do know (having learned the hard way) that changing your oil only every year and a half is an excellent way to need a new car.  In order to avoid replacing my current one, and owing to my local mechanic's recent changeover to "weekdays only". . . I took my car to Valvoline Instant Oil Change to have. . . my oil changed.

They changed my oil.  BUT. . . they also topped off fluids, explained the process, changed my air filter, checked my lights and much much more. . . in about fifteen minutes.  

I didn't call ahead.  I didn't sit in the "waiting room" leafing through old Cabella's catalogs and 2010 Hot Rod magazines.  I just sat in my car, drove up to the garage doors. . . and let the magic happen.  

And it is magic to me. . . cause I'm not a car guy.  If you're not a car guy either. . . good place to know.
I recently realized my son has been auditioning for Garth for almost 5 years now.  It's hard to believe how quickly the years pass.  I still remember the first time my son auditioned for Garth, he asked him what his favorite super hero was and at the time I think my son was watching Barnie so he just stared at Garth in the cute ways that a 3 year old can.  Or maybe not so cute but being my son's mother, anything he does I am bias- I will always think it's adorable!!!

As I get to know Jan & Garth better on the professional level, I think Phoenix is lucky to have them as casting directors.  They are caring, hard working folks who are reputable and both my son and I love auditioning for them.  I trust my son in the audition room with either Garth or Jan or any one of their associates.  

This is very important for parents to be able to trust the casting directors.

Per my last review, Garth and Jan also teach acting classes and it benefits any talent both child and adult to take classes with them since it's a lot easier for them to book you when they know who you are better rather than the 10 seconds in front of the camera during an audition.

Plus, they have knowledge they can share with you that are invaluable.  

Thanks Garth & Jan for all you do for the Phoenix industry!!!
A friend & myself ventured here so we are able in seeing the newest Smurfs movie late in the evening. Don't judge;). These little blue creations are cute.  I still have my Smurfs from when I was a child (insert huge grin).  Aside from the latest showing Friday evening in town, the kicker was we could kick our legs up in the recliners.  This theater has them. Why don't all movie theaters have these recliners at this point in the movie business game?!
Now, the staff lacks having pleasant dispositions. Perhaps they should see this movie for some laughter!  Ticket window, entry person &popcorn area employees basically were just miserable. 
Then, As the movie was showing (and no not the previews) two staff members kept coming in and out with mops.  It was quite distracting.  Instead of running back and forth with the mop bring the bucket in. That's if the mess they were cleaning couldn't be put off until AFTER the movie.  This partially movie showing had ten people . WAIT 12 people, two were staff members cleaning during a movie (insert emojis rolling eyes & shaking my head).
What can I say about Fountain? Well, I suppose I cannot say much (good) about their service, though maybe I hit it on a bad night. Let me be more specific: I hit it on a Happy Hour Meetup Group night. I went as part of the group that recent evening, and though what I ate was decent--and for a crepe with bananas, chocolate and whipped cream, really, how could it have been anything less than that? Indeed I would probably rate it as slightly better than decent. What I would rate as less than that however, was the snide commentary I received from a man who presumably was part of the restaurant staff. I had sat at a table with friends that happened to be near a couch. If one sat in one of the four chairs at the table just so, that chair would block off a pathway where one might pass through in getting from the door to the bar and rest of the restaurant. There were, of course, other pathways to get from point A (the door) to point B (the bar\/rest of the restaurant). However I was the unlucky one that particular evening to have the audacity (apparently) to sit in the chair that if tilted a certain way, blocked one path to getting to the bar. I had no idea that I was blocking anything that night, however--I'd never been to the restaurant before. In any case, a man wearing a grey sweater, if memory serves me right, came up to me and scolded me in a sarcastic tone for sitting where I was and in a snobby manner, suggested I get thee up and movin' from the space my behind currently occupied. Will I be back to Fountain anytime in the next decade? If you were me, what would you do? ....That's what I thought.
This place is awesome the atmosphere is cozy. Their job on the hands and feet is perfect, they take the time to get to know you.  When you come in again the next time they will greet you by your name.  I highly recommend this place you will feel cared and loved
Oh man... Blackhawk Hardware offers so much more than your typical Ace hardware store (of which they are affiliated with). Sure they have tools and garden stuff, but they also have tons of home goods and unique gift ideas. 

Grab a *free* bag of fresh popped popcorn and start cruising the aisles. Every single employee I encountered  was cheery and helpful. I found a bunch of stuff that I usually only find on Amazon. The prices may seem a little high, but shop local son!
Major yes- Emily *our drink angel* approached us in line at the bar and offered to grab us drinks.  We were nicely buzzed from bitter & twisted and thought we had a 20 minute wait judging from the crowd. Luckily we were wrong.

I love divey bars that encourage fun group activity!  The best part is that actually has class with a sophisticated yet reasonably priced cocktail menu.

We grabbed a booth near the Skeeball and actually got friendly interaction and more cocktail servers asking if we needed anything.

This place is literally by a dumpster but don't let that fool you! Descend into your alcohol induced fairy land.

My friend and I loved the bar shadow art installation and historical painting of the first female AZ governor.
Dr. Bracken is superb. He truly has a gift with animals. When we switched vets, I was a nervous wreck. Don't judge me for being a crazy pet owner -- nothing's too good for my furry babes. Dr. Bracken spends a lot of time with our animals and is also great in giving treatment options. He's so nice and friendly. 

I like the laid back environment, ease of appointment scheduling, and excellent location in Arcadia. This practice is also more affordable than others we've frequented. Glad we found this veterinary gem!
Thank you to Mark and Serge! Let me just say these guys are the best!!!!  I sat in the car, as we had our two dogs with us, while my husband went in.  After a few minutes he came out and said to come in and to bring in the dogs.  The store is very deceiving from the outside,   when you walk in their inventory is unbelievable.  The customer service they provide is top notch.  Not only did they walk us through many options but everyone in there was so kind to us and our dogs, they even offered the boys water!!!!  We found just what we wanted and then we went home......then we went back.....Mark was great as we decided with our first choice that the dimensions just did not work.  He was so patient with us while we went back through the process.  We found exactly what we needed to fit and could no be happier.   Do not waste your time going anywhere else.  We did and the first spot (very well known and close by) did not have the inventory, knowledge, or the customer service that Nevada Safes has.  Mark and Serge are very knowledgeable and you do not just get "sold" something, they listen to your needs and your budget and show you what works.  I would recommend these guys to anyone and will do just that!!!
That's a Wrap turns me into a vegetarian nearly every time I go. And I get hit on by hipster waitresses. I also can't believe I've never reviewed this place until now.

What do I love about That's a Wrap? Everything. The people are awesome. The space is extremely laid back and inviting. They have jameson and ginger ale on their limited cocktail menu. They have homemade lemonade. They pretty much have homemade everything. And I hardly ever get the same thing every time I go. 

That's a Wrap knows exactly what to do to please me.

The Tarragon and the Veggie Jackson are probably tied for my favorites. I've always wanted to try the carrot cake, but I'm deathly afraid I'll love it too much.

When I was in a few weeks ago, it took abou 20 minutes for my to go order, and to make it up to me, my next one was on the house. Because this place is awesome.
I love this place! The coffee is awesome, the cappuccino's are outrageously good, and the baked goods are off the chain. I go here with my dad probably every other week. I'd go more if it wasn't about 25 minutes away from my house. Right now I can't have caffeine, but they have great cocoa, and berry smoothies. I could sit there all day and eat anything that they baked. Scones, and muffins, cookies and cake, oh my!

If you haven't been yet try it.
3.5 stars 

Place is smallish but newish lol we came on a tuesday morning didn't have enough servers, agree service her was slow. food is good and prices are fair so not bad at all. Not out of the way but you need a car to get here from the strip. Located in a strip mall so either you're local or about to hit the road back to where ever you came  from.

Solid place no major issues!
Les cocktails sont bons  , les plats que je commandé  était correct  mais rien d'extra pour le prix que j'ai payé

Une autre  fois j'ai  été au club de la terasse bonsecour j' ai été vraiment déçu .La musique était mauvaise . L'ambiance était trop jeune de  15 - 18 ans
They suck! Had a confirmation and when I checked at my pick up time, they hadn't even scheduled it. Never again Clean Air Cab!!!!
Team orthodontics is incredible. If you are wondering where to get those teeth all fixed up think no more and go there. EVERYONE is great. Dr D is the best. We had two go through braces and they both have great smiles now. Thank you to everyone at team orthodontics for amazing service and amazing smiles.
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE - DO NOT GO!  Ordered a large pizza and bread sticks for pick-up and was told that it would be ready in 20 minutes.  I showed up in exactly 20 minutes and the girl at the counter said that they "forgot to make the pizza" but that they "caught it" and asked if I would mind waiting 5 minutes.  I said, no problem.  After 5 minutes the same girl said that they "forgot again" and asked me to wait another 15 minutes.  Since I was with kids I said that I couldn't wait and to just deliver it.  I called to check the status after waiting over an hour since I left the restaurant.  They said "it will get there when the driver gets there".  I explained the situation and the guy said again that "it will get there when the driver gets there".  To this point, it has been one hour and forty minutes since I ordered 1 large pizza and bread sticks and  it is still NOT here.  I will update if\/when is shows.

I can't make this up.  12 minutes after writing the 1st post, the delivery guy finally got here and they forgot the bread sticks.  Called and finally got the manager on the phone.  He had to "cash out a driver" and put me on hold.  After 6 minutes he finally came back and I had to recap the ordeal because it had "been a crazy night".  I recapped the ordeal for him, said that I didn't want anything in return and made sure that he knew that it was me that put the YELP review in tonight.
Such a tasty fresh lunch spot! As others have said it's like going home for lunch.

I have had their sandwiches, usually turkey or tuna and they have a great selection of fresh breads and vegetables to top with. 

The real star however is the 2 or 3 salad combo. The 3 salads comes to around $7 after tax and they always have a great selection. I favour the greek pasta or tuna pasta salad and then couscous and the arugala\/beet\/feta\/pecan. You can really tell that they make them fresh that day. I always feel satisfied but not overly "full" afterwards which is perfect. 

I also love their spinach pies (basically a spanakopita) for 3.99.  With a side salad it too makes a perfect lunch.

Make sure to check out the soups while you're there too, the red lentil is especially tasty.

Free WiFi! Couch and comfortable chairs!

Note: someone mentioned no debit? They definitely DO have debit.
Before I visited Sliders I had been so disappointed in burgers around GTA in general that I stopped even trying to find any new places well over a year ago. But what do you know, there's life on Mars! 

Out of four different sliders (the classic one, the mushroom-spiked version of the latter, the parmesan cheese chicken and the spicy jerky chicken) I tried during my first but definitely not last visit I'd have to call the mushroom version a winner, though they were all pretty awesome.  The specialty spicy sauce went very well with the beef burgers, and tzatziki is just what you need to cut through the spicy chicken. The chilli & cheese fries didn't disappoint either, and the size of a large potion simply blew my mind (beware, it's humongous and it has lots of beans to boot). On top of all that goodness the place sells beers and it's open till midnight (always the time I have the worst cravings). I mean what else can you ask for?
Dr. Bullero delivered my second baby at Banner Gateway, and has been my OB GYN doctor for nearly 6 years. This office has the friendliest, most efficient staff around. The well woman exams are done by a nurse practitioner, and Becky is ultra fast and so sweet. Her bedside manner coincides with Dr. B's and you really feel valued as a patient. I would highly recommend this office to anyone looking to have a personal relationship with their doctor's office and to have their baby delivered by the ABSOLUTE best doctor around.
This is my first time writing a review for a food truck. I think it's kinda cool since food trucks are mobile I would think they would not be able to be listed for writing reviews- yet here they are on Yelp!

Can I just say, "Yum!"  Let me first declare that I generally don't have a sweet tooth but this delectable concoctions just looked too mouth watering to pass up!

I was at the Unexpected Art Gallery grand opening downtown when I noticed several of the fellow festival goers had these mounds of ice cream on top of a waffle and it just looked yummy!

After seeing waffle creation after waffle creation I couldn't resist anymore and I bought one that was waffle smeared with Nutella with about a pint of vanilla ice cream on top with a piece of chocolate & the girl was nice enough to also give me 2 scoops of freshly made whipped cream. 

I prob could have eaten this whole creation myself- I shared with 2 other friends and it was still plenty for us. 

And I can write that I didn't indulge- sort of.
This part of Scottsdale has needed a good breakfast place forever. I mean, how many times can you go to Chompies?! Thought we'd try it out after it's appearance on DDD. Was really looking forward to enjoying the breakfast enchiladas, but was extremely disappointed.  The only flavor on the plate was the sauce. I tried different ingredients without the sauce, and got nothing. The plate was also really plain looking and you'd think there would be a garnish or something. Parsley, kale, potatoes? I don't  judge a dish by its garnish, but when the flavor isn't there, then everything is fair game in my book. My daughter had an omelette with ham, cheese and peppers which was also bland. Hey guys in the kitchen! Flavortown did a show here, how about some flavor!!! The only thing saving this review was the service and our waitress was great, never needed anything and she was very attentive. Having the bar probably also helps draw in the day drinkers. I'll give it another shot when I'm back in town.
It's 1:20am and I am so tired, but I just cannot go to sleep without writing a review for this place. I just have to get it off my chest. This small, cozy, reservation-only place is off the hook!! (excuse my slang, I just don't know any other ways to put it) I thought Ichiza was the only late night Japanese hang out place in Vegas, but I was wrong! This place serves authentic Japanese food for very reasonable price, just like Ichiza, but in more sophisticated style. I have ordered Foie Gras, Oden, Raku-Tofu, Agedashi-Tofu, Green Tea Creme Brulee, and Brown Sugar Flan. Everything tasted far beyond my expectation. Servers took time to explain how to eat every dish, and my tea cup was never empty for no more than 5 minutes. Great service! You can tell they put no weird chemicals to boost up the flavor, and food was simple, genuine, healthy, and marvelous. As soon as I've heard this place is reservation-only, I put their phone number in my phone... that's how much they've blown off my mind. Will definitely repeat.
Love this place! I'm from the East Coast and every time I visit Vegas I always come here for my Mexican food fix. I always get a quesadilla and a virgin piña colada. Always fill me up! Another thing I love is there refried bean dip! Wish they would put it in jars and sell it cause it is so good. And the staff is super friendly and funny. I will continue coming here until I can't no more!
Right after we moved to Charlotte, I was talking to a local in a bar about how I wanted great Mexican food. He directed me to Azteca, and told me not to worry about the fact it was connected with a Days Inn.

That was 8 years ago, and after trying numerous Mexican restaurants in Charlotte, Azteca remains far and away our favorite. The food is delicious and the portions are huge for the price you pay. Service is always friendly and prompt. The restaurant is hopping on a Friday or Saturday night, and it's always a fun place to hang out. 

The mariachi band that plays on the weekend is a blast. On one of our last visits, they asked us if we wanted them to play us a song. We said sure, but we didn't know which one, so we suggested they play us their favorite song. They chose Elvis, which cracked us up.

My husband loves the Arroz con Pollo. I switch around dishes, but lately my favorite is the Pork Carnitas. For $11, you get a plate with so much food on it that taking home leftovers is a must. We've had nothing but great visits to Azteca!
I've visited this place a half a dozen times over the years. Usually it's a quick stop for something to eat late at night after I get off work.

The food and the service have always been great.
My go to, absolute favorite grocery store.  Sure, I love Trader Joe's and Whole Foods for specialty items for dinner or entertaining but they aren't one stop shops like Safeway.  

This location has recently gone through a renovation and a lot of great changes.  The staff are friendly and helpful too.  

Just beware, the snow birds flock here and sometimes hold up the lines while writing checks or scrounging around for exact change, so come with some patience.
Would've never considered this place myself, but heard a recommendation from a friend that their sweet and spicy chicken wings with fried rice and pickled radishes were a match made in haven. And let me tell you, it's totally true! Add a nice chilled beer to that and it's pure bliss! I just loved their chicken wings and their radish salad (in fact I liked the latter so much I ordered and extra large potion of it later). Unfortunately can't comment on anything else off their menu, since both times I went there I ordered the same stuff :P They are also closed on Sunday, which is a bummer, since I had really bad cravings yesterday...
Come for a drink, avoid the food. The guys here are nice, but it seems they do so to make up for the horrible reheated food. The veggie fried rolls (menu says spring roll) definitely were thawed and microwaved, same for jalapeno poppers. At least they had Singha beer lol
Not really familiar with this brand, but it was a good cup of coffee.  they must use gold coffee because it is rather pricey. ( yes, I have been here before, it's called sarcasim.)
2 reviews in 2 days for my favorite coffee joint!  This morning (like many other mornings lol) I rushed out of the house without eating but secretly I was already looking forward to coming here since I had an hour b4 my next appointment. 
So here I am enjoying the pleasant, comfy atmosphere listening to Christmas music. There's a networking meeting in the private room you can reserve to us for free. People eating bfast, relaxing and browsing on their phone or tablet. 
I had been eyeing their lunch special of corn beef and Swiss sandwich with a side for awhile so that's what I ordered. The sandwich comes in a French roll toasted- just perfect for my hungry stomach this morning!
Of course I need to mention the friendly staff here. Everyone always so friendly and helpful. And patient too cause some mornings when I've been here my brain is still sleeping and they've always bantered with me while my brain woke up. 
Love this hidden gem!
So- we are campers.  And by campers, I mean we have an awesome pull behind 34 ft trailer that suit us all just fine.  Some would call it "glamping" but whatever.  We have never stayed at a KOA, but we're optimistic, paid the $30 to become members, and started a new relationship.  I had to go to a week long class in Charlotte, and needed to stay somewhere that wasn't $100+ a night, since I was footing the bill for this trip.  We were able to get a site here on the fly- which was good!!  The lady on the phone was very nice and pleasant.
The campground itself was a little odd.  The sites were sort of funny- in the middle- they were all stacked up on top of each other.  They did upgrade us to a concrete pad- which was nice, but like the other folks that reviewed stated- there isn't much room for vehicles, and there was no fire rings- weird.
You DO have to check in at the gas station across the little road (that is attached to a bar- that stays pretty busy for a gas station bar, and a liquor store), but the Publix (best grocery store in the world!) across the way was exciting.
I thought it was very nice and helpful that the KOA guy that checked us in, got into his KOA little jeep thing and showed us the way to our site.  ITs a good thing he did, b\/c my husband almost clipped a tree not paying attention to the back of the camper.
Since I was there a whole week, i got to see how most folks that stay there only stay for a night or two.  At least on the side WE were staying.  On the other side of the fence, it looks like people are LIVING there.  Full time living there. Is that a thing? Can people do that?
There is a $30 rental fee (refundable) to hook up to the cable.
There is also wifi (the reason for the 2 star review).  The wifi shows a full signal, but it's terrible!  Poor me- no wifi while I'm camping- but the problem is I was there for a CLASS and had to do tests and studying for several hours a night.  On the first day when I couldn't get online with their "free wifi", I had to up the data for my cell phone and just use it as a hot spot.  Went through about 3 gigs the whole week.  If you're using the free wifi as a selling point- please make sure it works!

We will give KOA another shot- but probably not this one.  The traffic in this area is out of control.  Like INSANE.  The traffic was so bad, i didn't even venture to any restaurants in the area, b\/c I was afraid that I couldn't make it back across the street with all 4 lanes blocked all morning and all evening.  Cereal for dinner is good though, and this Publix has an incredible wine selection :)
Service effing SUCKS!!! My husband and I were seated, given water, menus and plates then ignored for 20 MINUTES!!! We walked out and went somewhere else. We were very excited to try this place due to all the good reviews, but I will make sure to never recommend this place to anyone.
Joia is a fantastic restaurant.  Service was outstanding, food was delicious, and the restaurant is just elegant.  I came here with my girlfriend for her birthday and it went undeniably well.  

After ordering, we promptly received some fresh bread served with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  The bread wasn't anything special, but it was fresh and warm and that's one of the most important things.

We got the escargots with Portobello mushrooms to start and it was FLAVOURFUL. The escargots were cooked just right and I enjoyed them very much.

As our mains dishes, we got a risotto and the veal marsala.  The veal was tender, and the marsala sauce complimented the meat very well.  The veal came with a side of truffle mash and grilled vegetables which give it a very pleasant smell and taste.  The risotto comes with green peas, red onion, and mascarpone cream.  Again the risotto had a pleasant and creamy scent.

Lastly, I wanted to go over the service here.  It is hands down one of the best that I've experienced in my life.  The staff are courteous, attentive, friendly, and humourous.
Shake Shake in DTS:

You order at the counter as soon as you walk in then they give you a pager to notify you when your order is ready. There is plenty of seating in the dining area. The dining area is mostly comprised of booths, with some chairs. The entire place appeared to be very clean.

We tried a few different menu items. The bill totaled 43.71 for the following order:

2 - Shack Stack Burger - Good burger, but pretty small for the price.

1 - Chicken sandwich - Pretty good chicken sandwich. I like the pepper taste in the batter. Again, small for the price.

1 - Chicago Dog - I guess it is good if you like Chicago style dogs. I don't care for all of the toppings.

1 - Chicken Dog - the chicken apple sausage dog was good, but I should not have told them to top it like the Chicago dog.

1 - Crinkle Fries - good fries.

I like the fact that the chicken served here is free range and all of the meat is natural (No hormones and no anti-biotics). I would recommend trying this place. The burgers and the chicken are worth coming back for. No more Chicago hot dogs for me.
Thanks, Nikki and Tenders for inviting us out for a fantastic evening! I don't venture into Cornelius often but now I have a reason to. Hilary was a kind and attentive hostess. We had our own space and servers. The night started with salads and an amazingly addictive caramel dip. The fries came with a whole tray of dips. Of course, I had to try them all. My favorite was the blue buffalo dip. The food just kept on rolling... zucchini fries, chicken sandwich, turkey sandwich, tenders, nuggets, milkshakes... Phew... Roll me out... The food was all fantastic. My favorite items were the zucchini fries and turkey sandwich. Of course the tenders were dabomb.com too. Thanks for a fantastic evening and full belly! I will definitely be back!!
3.5\/5!
It is never too late to go back to School!! 

Naturally, the first thing I noticed is the decorations that reflect the "school" theme of the restaurant. All the clocks are set to 3:30PM, there are papers with scribbles hanging on from the ceiling, and of course, an apple on each table! Their menu are printed on lined papers and on clipboards, how cute! There are also chalkboard walls that explain the different meat cuts of a cow\/pig.

-Chive biscuit - $3.50: I have always gotten sweet biscuits\/scones so I was surprised to receive a savoury biscuit. It was hot and flaky, super delicious with a small hint of chives, and you can definitely tell these were homemade

-Blueberry Watermelon Lychee- $5.50

-Black 'n' Blue pancake - $12: These pancakes were ah-okay. I found them to be a bit denser, doughy and not as fluffy as the ones at Mildred. The pancakes were more of a plain pancake as they didn't have the blueberries incorporate within the mix, and the sauce is sweet with a hint of tartness. Nonetheless, I appreciate that they offer the syrup in a short glass as I can control how much sweetness I want. Also, the brown sugar butter was not needed, it served no purpose and didn't add any flavor to the pancakes for me.

-Headmaster Omelette w\/ Gorgonzola - $16: The omelette was exceptionally tender, light and moist. While the omelette itself is bland, the gorgonzola cheese is quite salty so make sure to get the melted cheese with every bites :). I didn't think the omelette was worth $16 though...
If you're looking to grow you eyebrows out, get a nice shape and you're weary of trying a new spot -- this place is safe! 

I had a HORRIBLE experience with threading a few years ago and I'm still growing the middle part of one of my brows back. As a result, I had sworn off threading. I've been to a few other wax brow bars that were ok but mostly maintained my own brows for the past few years -- which usually resulted with me plucking way too much late at night in a bathroom mirror and waking up with regrets. Until I found this place! 

Recently, the new shop showed up in my yelp eyebrow search and I couldn't believe all the positive reviews and before\/after pics. I decided to give it a shot and now I'm hooked!

First, who can beat $8 for brows?! And Farida, the owner is so sweet, patient and very gentle with threading. I remembered the process being a lot more painful but she does such a great job. She's also great about helping you map out your brows if you're trying to grow them out in certain areas (like me). 

I've gone twice now and I'll be coming back as a regular. Her service is great. The shop is clean and conveniently located with lots of parking in a plaza.  

Gone are the days of me plucking away my brows or praying that the brow bar girl doesn't get too rambunctious. Soooo happy I found this place!
raw chicken is unacceptable in anyones plate! The meal should have been free for both my guest and I...for this I remove a star. Take care of your clients because saying sorry sometimes isn't enough no matter how sweet you can be!
I keep coming back to Sabai Sabai because the food is so fantastic, well priced, staff are friendly and the experience is so pleasant. 

I was there last night with my sister and went with the squash fritters, massaman curry (both of which are not to be missed), the street noodles and for something different we went for the pork skewers which I'd never tried. Everything was so flavourful and the pork skewers were a nice meaty choice to compliment the starchiness of the other dishes. For 4 dishes between the 2 of us (which was more than enough food) it came to $40 which is so reasonable. I love that you can get such variety which is my favourite way to eat. 

Also worth noting, last time I was here I left my phone in the bathroom. I didn't realize until about an hour later when I got home. They had found it and set it aside until I was able to return later that evening. Really great people working at Sabai Sabai!
The New York New York Hotel was very cool. Came here to celebrate my best friends bachelor party weekend. He said he wanted to stay in a fun hotel on the strip. After doing some research, I picked this place for us. So as his best man, I had to make sure he had a good time.

We stayed in the players suite. Came with a jacuzzi. Nice layout for the room and plenty of space. The service here was very good and prompt. Made sure we always had fresh towels. 

I indulged in sports betting at the sports book. It was so cool and thrilling to set up some bets, watch the games there, and wait on the results. I ended up winning too! Plenty of tv screens and they have all the games on. The casino itself is big. Lots of slots and tables to play on. Then there many different food choices there to eat. Steak, brunch, pizza, hot dogs, crepes, etc. 

It's in a good location on the strip, so you can walk in any direction to go do some other things, and you're not too far from the hotel. I would definitely stay here again. My friends enjoyed it as well, so we'll probably be back soon.
Yes, it drags at times, but the finale is exceptionally "action packed" (pyrotechnics!) to make up for it.  The rotating\/vertical stages are a unique central element that is well utilized throughout the show.  The storyline\/plot is linear, unlike some other Cirque shows.  I do admit to reading Wikipedia afterwards to understand some of the intricacies ("Oh, THAT'S what they were trying to show!")

Favorite parts: the sparkly long-haired guy (fairy prince?) swinging around and the dreadlocked pole fighter jester\/bodyguard guy, especially when he's doing the shadow puppets with the prince.

The theater is exceptionally cool looking, and the pre-show "scary warriors" are not as stupid as the two clowns at O.  The theater's snack and beverage bars are combined (unlike O's), so the lines can be long for a bag of popcorn and a water, but the bartender-cashiers are exceptionally fast and professional.  There isn't a full gallery exhibition, but they do have a collection of Ka costumes and a few pre-show musicians\/performers out in the theater lobby outside the snack bar.

I found the humorous bits less boring and obnoxious compared to O's (the beach scene wasn't awful).  Ka has more of an action\/martial arts focus compared to O's diving\/ballet.

Ka was also a cheaper ticket than O for me.  I also liked that I could pick up my "Will Call" ticket at the Concierge instead of waiting in the box office line, though I don't see why MGM uses Ticketmaster for O but physical tickets for Ka, unless it's a money saving thing.
I was in the area and decided I would check this place out. Let me just say this, the time to go to this place is around 3PM because you will get treated like a king (or in my case, a queen! :)

I didn't really know what to order, so many choices, and Billie working behind the counter gave me several suggestions. I  go with the smoked turkey sandwich and red beans & rice for my side. She let me sample the beans before I got them (just to make sure they weren't too spicy). When I sat down, she asked if I would like a sample of the pork. Of course I do!! And damn I should have ordered the pork because it was delicious! The smoked turkey was good too just not like the pork. The BBQ sauce they put on too is sweet and yummy!! 

As I'm eating, Billie and another staff member come out and talk to me for about 20 minutes. Both are really cool, laid back people and enjoyed having some company (as I went in alone). The entire time I was there, nobody else came in so it was fun talking to the staff. Just want to point out they do get slammed for lunch and dinner but since 3PM on a Thursday is an odd time to eat, they weren't busy. 

Definitely loved this place and will be returning!!
I want to support this local business but I can't. Quality and value have both dropped precipitously in recent years.  Ingredients don't seem fresh, pizza dough is mediocre and prices are well above average.
This store is located on the corner of Towncenter Dr and W Charleston. It has pretty much everything the store down the street has except for a car wash.

This gas station is much easier to enter and exit from W Charleston than the other Terrible Herbst down the street in front of Costco. That is what I like about this location. If they had a car wash here I would probably come to this location  more often as opposed to going to the location near Costco, as I do.

The staff here is friendly and I don't recall ever having to wait in line too long.
You have to be a certain type of special person to like this food and be in a certain special state of mind to want to come here....like you have to have a heart attack a few seconds after taking a bite. 

If that's you and that's what you want. Have a ball. I will be enjoying not having clogged arteries somewhere else....
What a terrific experience!  We had a fantastic Teppanyaki chef who was both entertaining and dazzled me with his "tricks" as he cooked our table's food - which tasted amazing, by the way!  Both my date and I thought our respective dishes were very delicious.  Also, he cooked my tofu before he cooked the meat - this probably wouldn't mean much to a meat eater, but means a lot to me, since I've been a lifelong vegetarian for health and ethical reasons.  I can't lie, I was a little worried about it, since everyone else ordered meat dishes - but I was not disappointed; huge points with me!  This is a restaurant I bookmark as a place to come back and enjoy again!
I am no expert on the art of framing - I've had two things framed in my life. But between those two experiences, Miller Frame was faster and less expensive as compared to the other (for a similar job). It's an extremely cluttered environment, but that's part of the realness that adds to the comfort of the space (which as a customer you don't necessarily spend much time in); it's a workshop, not a showroom. Wendi was really great at understanding my needs (which were of the most basic nature in this case); promptly proposing the right idea and calculated cost. I will definitely return for my future framing projects.
It's a buffet can't expect too much of the quality of the food but for $50 per person yeah you might as well make it worth if you do come here. I think it's overprice as a commission yeah seafood is expensive but I've had better and fresher seafood elsewhere that's worth the price. Overall I wouldn't say it's bad ether I liked it but I think only time I'd ever come back is if I got discount coupons or something. They have a good variety of food to try that's not too bad. I mainly came for oysters and crab legs what not...some of it tasted good others tasted a bit too fishy or just not as satisfying the crab legs were quite dried... Other than that I'd give it a second chance just not when I have to pay $100 for two when the food doesn't taste like $100 worth.
My local pub. Popped in for dinner last Friday with the hubs and we had a very pleasant experience - as 3 stars goes, it was A-OK. 

We were seated right away (it was pretty quiet as we were rather early for a Friday night, maybe 6:30pm. They have very nice spacious booths that are great for a group or a twosome. Plenty of TVs for sports viewing potential. 

Server was very nice and quick, unfortunately my Steamwhistle was a bit flat but they have so many beers on tap I understand how it would be hard to keep them all fresh. 

I had fish and chips and they were quite good actually. Haddock was fried perfectly and it was super moist inside. I have to complain a bit on the house made tartar sauce though - there was no bite to it at all. I expect some briney caper\/gherkin flavour to hit me right off the bat but it never came. Husband had the buffalo wings and they were perfectly standard.

No complaints about Dog & Bear if you're wanting to catch a game and have some pub grub but it's nothing spectacular.
This is THE website to go to for EXCELLENT spa, all beauty needs deals.

DO check out this website before you book any appointments!

Lisa, the owner, is true to her words.  The couple of times that I had direct interactions with her, everything she said she would do was completed in a timely manner.  

Plus, I love their Summer Spaaaah Series
BEAUTIFUL & AMAZING!  It's a show I'll never forget!!!  It was one of the best shows I've ever seen.
I called 1st Call Garage Doors to repair my garage door that had suddenly stopped responding to the remote control.  Ryan answered the phone politely and listened intently as I tried to explain my garage door issue. I also expressed that I had an urgent need to have the door repaired within 4 hours (before noon). Ryan arrived promptly before noon, quickly assessed the issue, quoted repair options and prices, and got the job well within my schedule. Ryan's responsiveness, professionalism, and expertise minimized interruption to my workday and quickly alleviated my worries over the unexpected garage door issue.  I highly recommend Ryan and 1st Call Garage Doors and will contact them for any future garage needs.
Rode our bikes to lunch at this newer oreganos location.  This American inspired italian local chain really has a yummy menu & a hip positive vibe through all locations from Tempe, old town, Bell Rd, or Tucson.

At this stop we sat at the bar with no wait and opted for a margarita and dos Equis for my hubby.  We ordered the simple salad & carne asada pizza.

The salad was large (even the half was a lot for 2 people) with just basic greens and like 2 croutons but maybe only $5 or something reasonable.

The pizza was I believe a puerto penasco named menu item.  After our long and sunny ride we were ready for something substantial and this did the trick.  Grilled carne asada thin crust with a yummy cilantro pesto to bring it together.  

Our service was friendly & professional even if the thin crust pizza took 40 minutes to come out.
I know a lot of people complain about the food and the service... But hey... It is Dave & Buster's. This one meets the expectation of mediocore food and subpar service. It's an adult Chuck E. Cheese. Video games, skeeball and booze = a good time for all. I would personally pass on the food and suggest sticking to beer (they can't really mess that up). 

Go for the games, pool, and bowling. Sign up for their emails for free game play coupons or go on Wednesdays for 1\/2 priced games. They also kick all the kiddos out at 11pm on the weekends to turn it into an adults only place.
The first review was surprisingly negative towards a great local business that has guided me though some personal illnesses and has been doing this for Toronto since 1936.  And by the way readers the candy has not been there since then.  I've eaten their food and it's fine, no need to freak out.  
The summery of products are mostly correct, although some big things were missed.  For one they carry some organic skin care products that Shoppers down the street would never carry.  And unlike the all of the skin care you'll find there (I know I use to work as a Shoppers cosmetician for 4 years) these don't have Parabens or SLS which are very harmful for your health.
Ohh yeah and Snowdon Pharmacy is a real pharmacy so they do something that Shoppers wont, they compound specialty medicine.  Like this awesome Ibuprofen gel I use for my sore muscles.  And I'm told by one of their Pharmacists they also do pet medication compounding.

Don't pass this place up because you want to get something cheaper from a mega huge corporate store, when you can promote a local business.  My opinion is if you're into being healthy and experiencing a real pharmacy, then go to Snowdon Pharmacy.  But if you want to buy life brand Liquid Advil and a magazine then go to Shoppers.
The Uptown Rhino Market & Deli delivers on all fronts. Grab a breakfast burrito, one of my favorites in town, and a cup of coffee for less than $8. Go for lunch and trade in the burrito for any sandwich and a beer. Enjoy the vibe, peruse the aisles of beers and snacks, read a newspaper, do some work. Just chill and enjoy.
First rule of Brunch Club is that if you're going to be serving brunch, you have to be ready to serve brunch. The brunch crowd wants their food. They want eggs and pancakes and bacon and toast. Stat. At the very least they want coffee or a mimosa pronto.

Second rule of Brunch Club is to offer enjoyable breakfast items. I was sad to arrive here for Smunch one day and order something on the lunch side of brunch. For the first time. In my life. A chicken pita?

Don't get me wrong, the food was fantastic. Anything that sounds good usually is at Pita Jungle. They were also great with separate checks. I just think that brunch is a little lacking and could use some guidance. From true brunchers and breakfast enthusiasts.
Belle endroit,  bon service  de la part de notre  serveuse . Bon repas et super désert ! J'y retourne  c'est sûr !
Good if you wanna try sipping tea and cheese foam. Pretty small location with barely any room to chill at.
Ooh, it's vair nice; all the same I wasn't swept off my feet. Perhaps that's because I didn't partake of their famous cakery when I when - just a hot chocolate. Twas a fine hot chocolate of rose-flavoured goodness, and yes, I shall be listing this review in my list of "reviews where I mention how much I love all things that involve roses".

As noted by other reviewers, it's a junkyard haven of a place, full of reclaimed this and upcycled that, and we settled ourselves on a grebby but comfortable sofa. It's a difficult line to walk, I think, though, and it's all about context - namely, if you've got a front window that habitually steams up, that grebby sofa can quickly move from "cutely unselfconscious" to "not out of place in student digs". It's not that it doesn't all hang together, thematically - it's that it hangs together slightly too well.

That said, the hot chocolate was great, and if the cakes are as yummy as I'm led to believe next time I go back (for go back I shall), I may well be donating an extra star before too long.

Also, Ursula D is bang on. Instafollow them immediately. That's an order.
My mother and I have been coming to Scottsdale Hand and Foot for about a year now. Denny has always been pleasant and the technicians works well as a team. I admire and appreciate Cindy's patience and understanding with my mother. We have always had excellent quality service. Our appointments are on time. The location is clean and the polish selection superior. I highly recommend you give this location a try. You'll love the experience.  Note: I drive from south chandler for this great service. It's worth the trip!
Atherton Market is a neat spot. Come and sip on Not Just Coffee's caramel latte while strolling around local vendor booths. Take a cooking class with Alyssa and grab some Cloister honey to take home.
The wax they use for the Brazilian resulted in probably one of the most painful waxing treatments I have ever had.  And I have had bad ones.  Just moved back to the area and used a Groupon to try to find a new spa.  I give three stars because the person applying the wax definitely had a good personality but I remember just being above my pain threshold and wanting to stop the wax.  I have a pretty high tolerance for pain but I could feel my skin ripping off when she was working.  If I knew then that Groupon offered refunds, I would have called for a refund.
Very expensive chocolate boutique, and more upscale than Godiva.  Chocolate is around $2 per piece, and the cheaper (thinner) candy bars were $4 (the large, multiple caramel-filled square one was $9 if I remember correctly).  Check out the website for the Biltmore Takeout menu (note that it doesn't include everything they sell, nor does the website's online store).

Their ingredients are first-rate, and they're local, so I feel a little bit better about spending a chunk of change on a friend's gift (I needed to get something unique and local).

The packaging (nice shopping bag, pink tissue paper, fancy boxes) is very nice, though be aware that boxed sets carry a small premium for the extra fancy packaging and plastic seal.

I haven't had anything they sell here myself beyond a few tiny free samples, but what I did taste was very smooth and creamy, both milk and dark.

Thankfully, holiday boxed sets are 25% off now, while supplies last!
You like your meat long, smoked, and spicy? They got that. 

Short and thick  with an au naturel casing? They got that too. 

Thin, floppy and tasting of meatloaf? Hey, whatever gets your rocks off. 

The snausages here are crazy amazing and they have just about any pork related product your little heart can dream up, ground to an appetizing taste and texture with just the right amount of spice. The prices are also more than fair compared to other meat markets around town. 

Word to the wise, Schreiner's is a small mom and pop and they only take cash, check (crazy, right?), or debit cards. No credit will be extended to your broke ass. And if you want to use your debit card you have to gather up at least ten bucks worth of meat in your hot little paws before they'll run the card. Don't worry, it's more than easy to do. 

The people that work here are very knowledgeable and if you tell them what you like and why, they'll recommend all sorts of stuff. They have an intimate knowledge of the meat they sling. So stop on buy, shoot the shit, and they'll slip you some mighty fine sausage.
Really delicious pizza - you can tell that they put care into the ingredients they use which is great. The sauce is really fantastic and they have great options on the menu. 

We enjoyed the atmosphere - it was a relaxed restaurant and we sat for a while after the meal just chatting. We weren't rushed out which was appreciated although we did have to get their attention for water refills it was a god service. 

Their prices are a little on the higher range for what you get in the end - maybe because of their location but it did feel worth it. 

End the meal with a cappuccino definitely worth trying.
I heard one of the greatest lines ever from Mr. Man this last Sunday, after arriving in the Brunswick Zone (say that in an over dramatic echoing voice for maximum appeal) and allowing our eyes to adjust to the black lit cosmic bowling atmosphere. A flicker of disdain crossed his eyes as he uttered...

"This place is a fucking hatchery!"

Best off the cuff remark ever. The place was crawling with little kids from no less than five birthday parties. Sundays and cosmic bowling must act as a beacon to small children. Anyone who knows me understands that there is no love lost between me and little kids. Thankfully, the shrill dog whistle of excitement they make when hopped up on pixie sticks and soda pop was drowned out by the sounds of bowling.

We were meeting a couple people here and wasted the time with four dollar bud bottles as we took in the mind boggling number of wee little munchkins tearing ass across the bowling alley and lobbing six pound balls down lanes with bumpers. Our party arrived and we proceeded to have a wicked amount of fun. 

I don't know how you can possibly go bowling and NOT have fun. Between the shit talking and cheap pitchers, hilarity ensues. They eventually turned the lights on, the little kiddos filed out, and our crass, inappropriate humor was given free reign to shine.

I'm pretty sure everything there cost about four bucks. The beer. The shoe rental. The game. It's not the cheapest way to waste away an afternoon, but it's sure as hell a lot more fun than sitting on some sweltering bar patio or holed up inside watching a movie, with or without the ankle biters.
I got the Super 8. It's $9.95 and has 2 Pancakes, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, eggs any style and home fries. It wasn't too bad it's pretty greasy. The sausages are clearly deep fried, but kind of good. The coffee is $1.50 free refills it's kind of mediocre. It's not very busy at all. It's definitely a place we could come back to. Oh and they take debit that's always a plus. They have a tv here too, the jays game was on.
So Zales DOES stand behind their product!! Today a gentleman by the name of Josh called, he was wonderful and made things right! Thank you so much!!
First time here for dimsum and I liked it. Good variety to choose from, and food and service was good. Especially good if you come before 11am for their early bird special. Looking forward to going to back!
Decided to try this place after reading the reviews. Was not disappointed. Huge portions and a bit of a long wait. They will take phone orders over the walk ins. So call ahead to order!

Tried the burrito with rice but will be back to try the noodle version!!
For a long time I heard from various people that the lights are phenomenal at Hinkley's but that I would pay for it dearly. I'd just like to state that in no way is that true.

I went in needing something different, something fun to change up some spaces. Looking through the store I was more worried that none of the displays matched what I wanted exactly more than the price. Hesitant, I went to the counter and asked to look at some flush mount lights for a hallway that are more of a brushed metal finish.

What did I end up finding? Lights for everything I needed that were exactly what I was picturing in my head. The price probably exceeds Home Depot, but these aren't your typical lights. After doing some price comparison, the lights were very reasonably priced and I went in the next day to place an order. Jennifer, the woman that helped me previously, answered all my questions and helped me with everything. In the end, they were even able to swing a discount on some of the items, thus lowering the price more.

If you are looking for lights in Phoenix, please ignore all the misconceptions about insanely high prices at Hinkley's. The service is fantastic, the lights are gorgeous to look at, and the prices are insanely competitive.
Every dish we tried was cooked to perfection with such a complex and subtle flavouring. It's flavours that you can't even imagine until they're dancing along your palette.  

The service is fantastic and quick. The restaurant is warm the Indonesian music is absolute a treat to the dining experience. 

If you haven't been here then you're missing out on an incredible culinary step in your foodie life!
4 stars because the donuts are 5 stars and the coffee is two stars...at best.  The donuts are amazing, made to order for the glaze and topping and when they are warm they are omfg delicious. I ordered a coffee style donut and one with bacon, and they were both mouthwatering good. Even thinking about them now I can't help but salivate.

The coffee on the other hand...is a complete let down. I'd suggest going next door to a gas station for coffee that is equally good or better. 

Overall I'll definitely come back for donuts time and again.
The good: Great Thai food, the Khao Soi is a must try.
The bad: No reservations and it can be a long wait if you get there between 7-7:30. Come early or come late.

Definitely one of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto, Khao San Road is packed most nights and you'll find yourself waiting 15+ minutes for a table if you get there past 7. They don't take reservations so come early or come late, just try not to come at the peak hours.

A heavy dish, the Khao Soi is a egg noodle dish with a creamy, coconut curry base that comes with Chicken ($13) or beef ($14) and topped with crispy noodles - and d@mn it's good. You can get it with no spice, mild, spicy and Thai spicy. I had the spicy version, which really isn't that spicy and it was great - the curry was well balanced and flavourful (and probably calorie packed) while the noodles were well cooked and the crispy noodles give it a nice contrast of texture. 

Others told me the fritter appetizer (fried something or other) is really good too, but that will have to wait until next time.

Beers are $6.
I live on Mt. Washington, so this place is convenient via incline to try something other than Redbeard's.  The happy hour specials are decent and the app's are tasty and diverse.  
My biggest complaint are the wait staff both in the bar area and the dining area.  They are just not attentive.  If you get to the happy hour at 6 and expect to have two drinks, guess again.  They will take your drink order at 6:15, meal order at 6:30, deliver your drinks at 6:20 and return with your food only in time for 7:05 to see if you need a refill.  Ask before the specials end.
Otherwise, this is a nice change of pace.  From my prior review, the drinks are still pricey
I like the Aldo chain of shoe stores because it is a pretty nice mixture of decent fashion, decent quality leather shoes, at decent prices. 

For men, it's like Clarks or Bass with more style, or Kenneth Cole without the designer price.  

The two stars is for the staff\/service. I didn't like the whiney voice of the person who helped us, she seemed off in her timing and attentiveness, should I say robotic sounding?

Hey, I helped earn my way through college selling shoes, and later was a junior buyer at a regional department store chain early in my career, so I know a little something about shoes. 

The girl that helped us didn't. 

We didn't buy anything, but I professionally reboxed and stacked up the pairs of shoes for them to easily put away. That includes putting back all the tissue, cardboard, plastic, etc. that comes inside the box of every pair. 

The staff didn't seem to care less. Unprofessional. 

Just call me an old Shoe Dog.

But a better breed than Al Bundy, the loser Horn Dog.
I came here cause one of the stylists, Tamara, needed hair models to complete her stylist training. I was there for color, hair cut and style. I must share that Tamara did a fantastic job with my hair. The most promising part is her passion for the profession and she has fantastic, warm people skills which I hope will not diminish as the year passes. I enjoyed getting to know her a bit while she spent time on my hair. 
I felt listened to when I was telling her my concerns. The hair massage was terrific. She used great products on me. I liked the cut and the style. 
Tamara the stylist was terrific. 
The only part that left me a little unsettled was as I went to leave, she casually mentioned that I had to pay for the products that were used and the receptionist asked if I wanted to leave a tip. 
Hmmmm, having to pay for the products used was never mentioned to me in all the correspondences I had with her. I am there to be her hair model to help her become a full stylist and I'm being asked to pay for hair products used and for a tip?
In other situations where I've been a hair model, not only was I not asked to pay for anything, I was thanked with a gift bag!  
I'm sure I would have been okay with it all if I was informed of it from the beginning. It just felt like I was hit with a hidden charge. I paid the $15 and unfortunately left not feeling 100% happy. 
I am sure that is not the intention of Tamara or the salon . . . Although I think and I hope if they reverse the situation, they can understand where I am coming from.
The lady at the front counter was nice, I came in for my iPhone being cracked and the one on rainbow was close but recommend me this place since its Black Friday I was just glad this place was open and convenient its close to the house .. She told me it's going to take a hr in a half to 2 hours coz there's phones ahead of me and I'm fine with that, I went to bestbuy to kill time I came back one hour and half and my phone was ready .. iPhone 6 screen replacement was 100 plus tax ..
Went to pick up a few New Years drinks and this was the first time I had been in it. It was absolutely the best wine, beer, and spirits store I have ever seen. They have endless varieties of vodka, brandy, scotch, rum, whiskey, wine, and of course beer. They have a pretty good sized beer cooler as well with some great exotic beers. They are also really well priced! It is also close to home for me as well so I will definitely be returning for all my alcoholic needs!
The meal was solid.  The waitress was very professional and the ambience provided for a nice evening-you could actually hear the folks you were dining with!  A nice place to take out of town guests to showcase Cleveland and the surrounding region.
It was delicious and they even brought out Thai chilis for me to pop one in my mouth as a dare which was followed by some refreshingly delicious Thai tea! Loved the raw oyster with the mushroom "caviar
If you're craving Chinese (or good food for that matter), check out Desert Jade. I came here on my lunch hour. Service was attentive and food came out really fast. The crowd starting really coming in at noon so I just missed it by coming in a little after 11AM. I ordered the lunch portion of the chicken broccoli, which also came with a scoop or rice and an egg roll. Hot tea is also available at each table. I really enjoyed the food and my experience. I will be back!
They are so unorganized!  I've had multiple lessons scheduled and learned they didn't have us on the schedule.  It's not fun having to explain to a little girl that they didn't have her on the schedule.
i have a general problem with ALL rental car companies with thoses "extra" fee's, but this one takes the cake! $2.50\/day for tire storage!!! WTF...
they advertise a price and slap on extra for this shit plus for registration plus for some kind of insurance for loss of key...what BS!
why dont they advertise clean? this is a scam in all Its splendor... oh and what choice do we have, didnt we read the 40page contract before we rented the car?
Wasn't crazy about the food or service. Not a great experience, guess I'll try again. The design on the inside was nice though.
4.5\/5

*I came to Patois around 11AM and the restaurant wasn't too busy, well at least no 1 hour line up. 

*The vibe was laid back and unpretentious. The decor is quite odd with colorful chairs, inflatable buoys, old photographs and a bright red Juicy Jerk sign - but somehow everything just went together!

*The service was amazing and our server was really attentive. 

-Patois Egg Benny (Cocktail beef patties, poached eggs, jerk mortadella, hollandaise, watercress green salad) - $13
The egg was poached perfectly with a creamy Hollandaise sauce, and the patties were hands down one of the best I have had in a long time. The pastry was super light, tender and flaky with multiple layers. The beef filling was aromatic with a hint of spicy and still moist inside, and who doesn't love that the beef was filled to the max!

-Quinoa breakfast fried rice (bacon, sausage, egg, crispy homefries) - $12
Surprisingly the quinoa tasted just like... regular rice LOL. The fried rice was a bit too salty for my taste which I think came from the Chinese sausage and the fries were too crispy, otherwise the dish was incredibly delicious and flavorful!
Most people who like Vietnamese Pho noodles (sometimes referred to as Tonkinese in Montreal) like the Pho Bo noodles, which is Beef (Bo) noodles. 

By far the beef is the most popular, and has a lot of variations. But if you like Chicken noodle soup (who doesn't, especially with a cold?) then Pho Tay Ho is known in Montreal for the best Pho Ga (chicken). 

They don't use free range chicken like Pho Ga An Nam in San Jose, CA, but they make a good Pho Ga.
I've tried many AYCE sushi joints in Vegas and they are all variations of the same plan, similar price and questionable quality. OMG is unfortunately no different and certainly no better than the rest of them.
The salmon, tuna, and yellowtail nigiri were not fresh, the nigiri rice in general was poorly executed and detracted from all the selections of fish. The best items were the unagi, ikura and salmon skin hand roll but it might differ on another day depending on so many factors. 
No way this place is 5 stars. I think I'm giving up on AYCE sushi. The quality just ain't there.
We chose Lavo because we wanted to try the food and the club.

The food is great.  The meatballs are great.  The appetizer is considerably over priced though.  I ordered the spaghetti carbonara.  It was excellent.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and it was loaded with tasty bits of meat.  Our server was knowledgable and very friendly.

I was surprised how much i liked the club.  Eating dinner there allowed us to skip the line and go directly in.  That is always a nice touch.  It is smaller than many of the newer clubs in Las Vegas, but it works.  The music mix is good.  The drinks are expensive, but right in line with most of the better clubs.
I really wish I could give this place a better review, since I see it has many raving reviews, but I just didn't have that great of an experience. I love trying new places and I especially love a good sandwich so I purchased a Groupon for lunch and decided since it was close by, I'd check it out. I liked that it was in downtown Mesa and had a cute concept with the whole picnic theme so I was looking forrward to something a little different. Parking is pretty limited, I got a spot on the side of the building but there wasn't a whole lot of other places to park other than the street.

It wasn't very busy during the lunch rush but I still waited about 20 minutes to get my food. I only ordered the caprese sandwich and a fruit cup so I was surprised it took as long as it did since they aren't actually cooking anything I ordered, just putting it together. Then, when I saw the size of my fruit cup, my jaw dropped open. It was literally the size of a cup you put ketchup or another condiment inside. I think total there were two pieces of strawberry and a few grapes. Sorry but if I didn't have a Groupon, I would have went up to the counter and asked for my money back on that alone! Then, when I tasted the sandwich, it really wasn't anything special.

I remember leaving disappointed and didn't feel like it was a good value at all. I also felt like the menu is pretty limited and there really wasn't a lot on there I would be interested in eating (and I am by no means a picky eater). Overall, not a place I enjoyed.
Crap Quality! Go to Arrowhead Coach! I bought a backpack here and loved it at first. I thought to myself... Why was this so cheap? Upon further research, most outlet malls use cheaper quality materials that last hardly at all. Hence the cheap prices. Just like this Store,.. Thee are specific factories which design these half-a** goodies that won't be found on the actual Coach Website... See for yourself. Genuine quality materials are meant to last a lifetime. I was told mine was kinda leather which is just like a cheap "processed" McDonalds burger is. So I returned it and bought a much nicer Coach backpack worth the Extra $$$ at Arrowhead Coach.                                      Haha get it? Factory outlet. "FACTORY outlet?
I was curious about this place for a little bit and waited for my family to be here to go - since they're from Barcelona.  It was simply amazing! The place itself is super cool, it's casual but full of decoration details that will catch your eyes. 
They have live music on Fridays, it starts around 6:30pm, we obviously missed out on it but It was still a great experience. The gentleman and the lady who were taking care of us were absolutely wonderful! They were both very patient in explaining to me what each item was and they were great with my family members that don't speak English. 

We did the all you can eat for $25,99 per person and the menu selection was really good. The order size is small so if you're really hungry order a couple of things at once. Food came out pretty quick and we tried almost everything on the menu, the flavors were just divine - just watch for the sauces as they can seem too spicy for some.
Desert is included and I recommend the bread pudim, it was fresh and warm.
We had a great time enjoying great food, I'm going back for sure!
As an avid meat eater and appreciator of unique foods, I was excited to try a vegan's take on comfort food.

But, what could have been a delicious meal was marred by unimaginative food that left our whole table saying "meh."

The Unchicken and Waffles, arguably their most popular dish, was an utter disappointment. The deep fried tofu pieces, which weren't entirely terrible tasting, were clearly pre-frozen from a bag. It wasn't so much mock fried chicken as it was a mock chicken mcnugget - if a chicken mcnugget lacked flavour and a soul. Not really the big "fried chicken" piece I was expecting from my previous encounters with the much better meat version. (Can't they do something cool with Seitan and some homemade batter?).

The collard greens were way too oily, they literally coated my mouth - not the most pleasant vegetables I've ever tasted - and you'd think veggies would be their wheelhouse considering they're a VEGAN restaurant. 

Lastly, the waffle was cold and the syrup had way too much cinnamon in it, overpowering all the other flavours.

All negatives aside, their Supremacy Fries (their vegan take on Taco Bell's Fries Supreme) were totally palatable... Not out of this world or spectacular by any means, but they were fine.

In conclusion, Hogtown misses the mark in multiple areas. They have an opportunity to create really delicious, interesting meat free alternatives to soul\/comfort food, yet everything falls disappointingly flat. 

TL;DR - It wasn't the lack of meat that ruined the meal, it was the lack of effort.
I love this target store because it is literally a one-stop place for everything. It is amazing! You have all of your groceries in one half of the store and the rest of the Target products you know and love in the other! It is great. The store is really well-kept up and it always clean and very professional looking. The staff there is extremely nice especially one particular manager who was very kind to us when I sat our front on black Friday for 9 hours :). There is always somebody walking around to aid people and they are so friendly about it. Not just the standard "isle 4 go find it yourself" type stuff. "Let me show you where those are". It is massive and it is in a much-needed developing area of my home town. There is some great stores going up there and a few fast-food joints! It is in a great location because the only other close target store is a 20-30 minute drive on the west side of Madison. Now Fitchburgians don't need to leave their own city finally! Also I suggest getting a Target credit card... Already low prices? with 5% off EVERY SINGLE PURCHASE!!!! It is exquisite!
I can't believe I haven't written a review for the Phoenix Symphony since I've been a regular here for the last 3 years!
I've brought my son here to see the Nutcracker performed by the AZ Ballet since he was two. And we're season subscribers to the Phoenix Symphony Family Series for the last two years. 
We have tickets in the Orchestra section so my son who is 5 can see all the musicians up close and personal to keep his attention.  I love how they add a little kid friendly entertainment and\/or performance to each concert to make it fun for the little ones. Also love the family activities an hour prior to start of concert. 
While there is no dress code, it's always nice to use this occasion to dress up my son a little so he knows we are going to some place special.
Positano's is a staple in my family, with a family member going at least once a week! It's a very friendly restaurant with a real family feel. It is casual, yet nice enough if you want a celebratory dinner. Due to the family-friendly feel, children are more than welcome here, although you won't see them running around or disrupting things. 

The wait staff are wonderful here. Everyone, including the owners are so warm and welcoming, and if you want to come on a Friday or Saturday night, you had better call ahead for a table because it is not uncommon to see a group of people standing at the door trying to come in and then have to be turned away because they are all booked up! If you are a regular, the wait staff truly makes an effort to get to know you. They know exactly what every member of my family will order every time we come - they might as well start preparing the dishes the second we walk in the door!

The menu is not huge, but they have pretty much everything you would expect at an Italian restaurant. If they don't have exactly what you are looking for, don't be afraid to ask. They are very accommodating and open to making substitutions. For example, I don't like mushrooms and they will gladly replace the mushrooms in the pasta primavera with asparagus or another vegetable. One time I was feeling like having some calamari in my pasta, and although this is not found on the menu, they happily made this for me. Although they do not have a specific children's menu, they will definitely custom make dishes to order for the little ones!

All in all, a wonderful and welcoming Italian restaurant that serves amazing food and does not feel pretentious. Take a visit there - it will be well worth it!
Not so sure why everyone raves about this place. The chocolate croissants are average and the chai latte was cold. Sorry, but I much rather get my tea and croissant from Starbucks. For half the price I can get a nice hot drink and average croissant.
Grimaldi's is located in Boca Park near the Cheese Cake Factory. Parking is awful there when they are busy, but they do offer valet parking if you would rather not walk a half mile or drive around looking for a spot all day.

They have outside seating as well as seating inside. There is also a bar inside the restaurant. The staff is very friendly and we did not have to wait too long for our food.

As far as the pizza goes, it's not bad. It is definitely over priced. It is good thin crust pizza. I can't tell the difference between coal oven pizza and wood fire pizza, but they use a coal oven. It is definitely not NY pizza. I would compare it to pizza like you would get at Sammy's.

The salads were were plain and bland, just like most pizza places serve their salads.

Again. It is expensive for a pizza in this place. Each item is $2 or $3 extra, depending on the item. One pizza with a few items really adds up.

I would recommend trying it though if you have never been there. It was pretty good.
My daughter has a shellfish allergy and I had a large party that wanted to dine at Boiling Crab. I asked if I could bring her own food since she has severe allergies and the staff was incredibly rude about it and said no. I asked to speak to a manager and I was sharply told no it was company policy. So many other seafood restaurants are accommodating, I'd prefer to give others my business. Smokin' Crawfish is just up the street, their food is incredible and their service is top notch. Go there instead!!
I heart Buffets.  There, I said it. People complain about large variety at the cost of quality dishes, poor presentation, so on and so forth. Well, two words for ya'll: Wicked Spoon.

Not much else I can say that anyone else hasn't already said, but in short, the quality is great with some unique dishes on the strip and the presentation is great, as a good as you can expect from a buffet line.   I think I've found my new favorite buffet on the strip.
Adding another star for carrying a treasure trove of unique items: Hawaiian brand kettle style potato chips, Starbucks double chocolate hot cocoa (drastically cheaper than at the grocers), and a (small) selection of Torani syrups and smoothie mixes.  I was tempted to buy the condensed Horchata mix or Vanilla Frapé powder mix!  

Keeping off one star for the location (though it's close to Great Wall's dim sum at least) and some of the horrific backlogs that form at the register (was stuck behind a massive reseller transaction that had to be rung up at least twice).  Thankfully I switched lanes!
I sauntered in last week wth a friend and Genia provided the most welcoming greet for us!  She immediately answered our questions about certain items we were in 'need' of and immediately directed us and the pulled items. Genia is the definition of awesome customer service!  She is, trust me...less than 20 minutes each of us had 'acquired' those 'needed' items (roughly 5 items for each of us)...now insert blushing emoji and followed by a hand clapping emoji as well!  Customer service speaks volumes, and yes even in this service industry town many don't value their customers, but Genia does!  Store is wonderfully merchandised and easily can maneuver around DNA's space of women's, men's and accessories!  Heading to the strip basically sucks the life out of me.  When a friend is in town and I'm in the mood for shopping (well, that's 24\/7 and accessible with that online shopping) I  suggest DNA!
The old Five Guys spot is now a Japanese place!

Classic Ramen: Ramen noodles were more cooked than I prefer and thicker too, almost the circumference of spaghetti noodles.  The broth was very plain chicken broth and lacked "umami" but the big spoonful (not an artful drizzle) of teriyaki sauce helped the broth once mixed in.  The chicken was fine, plain and not too dry.  I appreciated that they included a small whole egg in the price, though it's hard boiled.  Near the end of the bowl the sweetness was getting to me though.  2\/5 for the weak broth (I wish they'd use shrimp, fish, or even pork broth instead of chicken), too much teriyaki sauce on top the chicken (try a drizzle next time), and overcooked noodles (they need a better chew).  $7.75.

Crab cheese won ton roll: My first impression was that these were very tiny, and the nori is wrapped around the crab mixture with rice then surrounding that.  However, the taste was definitely above the imitation crab used in grocery store sushi!  You actually taste the crab!  They actually had a good texture too, and the tiny bit of won ton strips on top helped add a bit of crunch that was nice.  Despite the smaller portion, this was really good.  4\/5.  $4.50.

The music was meh (Little Richard, really?) but at a decent subtle volume.  It was beautiful weather on the patio, and I had a nice sunset view and great breeze, but it is still just a parking lot sidewalk seat.  I was not greeted or acknowledged right away, but the employees were friendly enough after that.  It's definitely chain food fare, but at least it's something different.  3\/5 stars seems about right.
This is such an amazing place and Unique to the Fitchburg area. Out of the 4 Great Danes in Madison, I think this one is by far the best. It just seems to have more character and life to it. It is really warm when you walk in like you have been a customer for years and the staff treats you just the same. They have an unbelievable knack for crafting beers which are delicious and plentiful. They have a gorgeous balcony with a huge grill and of course taps within a 5ft reach. It is gated to keep those pesky kids out and the drunken fun in!

The Great Dane Fitchburg is always so well kept; it's clean and shiny like it had just opened for the first time. Their food is amazing as well! I have had countless items off the menu so there is no one thing that I like more over another. The seats are massive and envelope you and make you feel like your curled up in a big LazyBoy chair while you eat. Don't forget all the massive TV's to watch the games on! Now the 1 coolest thing about this location? Barry Alvarez people! Yeah! He is here on Thursday nights! Anyways, this location has the feeling of class, a warm Fitchburg feeling and really nice people. Especially the staff!
Outstanding arts fair with high quality & diverse artists.  Soo many booths to pick from and delicious overpriced street foods. 

My husband and I have been to the Tucson arts fair and the Tempe fair several times through the past 10 years.  We enjoy the friendly atmosphere and diverse selection and usually show up first thing on Sunday morning around 10 am to beat the crowds.

I've gotten a sterling silver ring made from a shell, christmas ornaments, pottery, and food items here.  This year we returned to a booth we had browsed last year to purchase a large photograph of an opal printed on aluminum which makes it look like glass. Beautiful art!  We've seen some great pieces through the years.

This year one of the busiest booths was a custom dog collar booth that the seller was boasting "my wife handmade them all".  You could swap out removable flowers and bows to wide brightly colored ribbons!  For $24 you could get a collar and bow or $14 for the collar alone.

The best perk of this fair is the mini doughnuts made right in front of you! Yes!
Michaels is every Pinteresters dream store. They have every crafty item needed. Block of floral foam. Got it. Giant glass martini glass. Check. Baking supplies to make that Rainbow Cake. Yup, that too. My dislikes... It is cluttered and disorganized. The staff doesn't really seem to know what's going on either. But there is ALWAYS a sale. Never pay full price at Michaels. There is always a 40-50% off coupon you can get in the Sunday paper or online.
Ugh. Make sure you have your receipt handy in case you get accosted by a garage employee to prove you made a purchase for validated parking... So rude.
This nice Italian restaurant is the perfect place for a cute date night with that special someone. The place is simple but the food is delightful. l love the Eggplant Parmesan it is absolutely delicious and enough to split with two people. Also if your looking to hang out after dinner this place is close to Plaza Midwood, Elizabeth and not far from Uptown!
Great place for a girls night! I'm a bit cautious with Asian fusion places because most times it tastes just like regular chinese food with a higher price tag. We had:

Cheese burger spring rolls - this comes over a lettuce leaf which you wrap around the spring roll and eat. This was really rich and crispy. I loved the lettuce used because it added a freshness you needed to counterbalance the rich spring roll. This was overall, great!

Singapore slaw - always worth while! 19 ingredients all finely chopped with some dressing, I could have just eaten that. Amazing.

Slow Braised Beef - this was good. Not blown away, but good. Meat was soft, flavours went well together but all in all, just ok.

Peking & Char Sui Duck Breast & "LUCKEE" SHRIMP CHEUNG FUN - okay...here's where I took some issue with the cost vs. what you're getting. Note I am not a food connoisseur by any means, just someone who loves food. I found this was comparable to getting peking duck and cheung fun at any Chinese restaurant, just fancier. Clearly there were more ingredients and there were bigger chunks of duck and shrimp but flavour-wise, very similar. 

Service - very friendly staff and great service

Atmosphere - loved this! Kind of classy\/tacky but it works. Music was so loud I never hear much of what the staff said about the dishes they brought out. 

Why I gave 3\/5 when it sounds like it was so great? It was! Just not blown away by the food but the experience was awesome.
This was our second visit to DJ and it might not have happened if we had a similar experience on our first. Our first visit was shortly after opening and we rarely review because of predictable startup challenges. For the record, our first visit would have garnered 3 stars. During our initial visit, I asked a number of question to familiarize myself with the menu. Also inquired about a favorite dish I enjoyed during my time in SoCal....Chili Verde. Our waiter went to the kitchen returning with a thumbs up. Next time you visit just ask and the chef can prepare the CV. Hence our return visit, which was a bit disappointing as the chef wasn't as accommodating saying "no special orders"!  Okay but the excuses regarding no margaritas because the bartender didn't show for work, stale chips and mediocre over cooked-tasteless pork dish might be more expected in a grand opening! Waxhaw needs a quality Mexican restaurant and based on our experience may still be looking!
From the first time we visited, I have been impressed with this restaurant. Pho places are not common in our neck of the woods and I am very happy we have found one that serves great food and provides good service.

While pho itself usually has beef broth in it, the owner has been happy to make ours "veggie"--vegetable broth, noodles, herbs and vegetables. Delicious! Soup does the body (and soul) good and it is definite comfort food for me. The veggie spring rolls are also very good. 

We've never had bad service here and until something drastic changes, we will be frequent customers at this little strip mall joint.
The place for high quality craft cocktails in Matthews. Super friendly, talented and knowledgeable staff. Not your typical taphouse in town but a great place to chill  in a cozy environment for any custom drink you might want.
After reading other reviews, it seems that this is a common problem in this particular store... no body would help me, period!  My husband and I went in together and went our separate ways (he went to the surround sound, I went to the cameras).  Apparently he had a similar experience, but I can only account for what I personally went through.  I knew exactly what I was looking for because I've been doing a lot of research online, and was ready to try it out in person.. really get some good info and see how it felt in my hands, how it worked, etc.  After basically loitering around the DSLR camera's for about 15 minutes waiting for some help (everyone around me was helping other people or just literally ignoring my attempts at contact) and going totally un-noticed, I decided to just figure it out on my own.  When I picked up the camera and attempted to use it, an alarm started going off so I put it back down and waiting for someone to come.  An employee did in fact come, but his only mission was to turn that alarm off!  When I tried to engage in some kind of conversation he literally just turned around and walked away.  Ooooookay, so that's the game we're going to play.  So I picked the camera back up and, yep, you guessed it, set the alarm off again, and patiently waited for someone to come back.  It just so happened that it was the same guy from last time, and although looking especially irritated at my tactics, I smiled at him and told him I was glad he came back because I would like some help.  His idea of "helping" me was standing there with his hands on his hips just watching me struggle, saying nothing.  So I finally asked him if he could help me out and give me some info and answer some questions, and his response was simply "that's not how you do it!" - in response to what I was doing concerning the camera.  Let me paint a picture for you- I'm standing there, holding an almost $1,000 camera, with the intent to purchase.  I dont know about you, but I can think of a couple better ways to handle that situation as an employee.  And regardless of how much it was or what my plans were, it's called customer service.. maybe best buy needs to do some retraining or coaching because I'm obviously not the only one who has had issues in this department.
SMG is my top pick when I'm hungry and want to catch a good movie. They are cheap and have a good menu. Drinks are priced decently as well. 

Staff is always friendly and willing to help, as well as prompt to deliver food and drinks. 

My only stitch with this SMG is how the facility is treated. It doesn't look like management has much of a willingness to keep this place updated. Seats are cheap office chairs that I'm always a little scared to get too comfortable on but it's better to sit at these since they have a bar and the other seating just has a little side tray that's too small.

Bathrooms look like they are cleaned once a day and not kept throughout the day.
